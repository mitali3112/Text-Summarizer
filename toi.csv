GST Council meet: GST council approves transition plan for new tax rates for housing sector - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: In a move to aid the real estate sector, the all-powerful GST council on Tuesday approved a transition plan for the implementation of new tax structure for housing projects.


As per the decision taken by the GST council, the developers of residential projects which are incomplete as on March 31, will have option either to choose the old structure with Input Tax Credit (ITC) or to shift to new 5 per cent and 1 per cent rates without ITC.

In the previous meeting on February 24, the council slashed tax rates for under-construction flats to 5 per cent from 12 per cent and affordable homes to 1 per cent from 8 per cent, effective April 1.

""GST council today has approved transition plan for the new rate structure for real estate residential projects...from April 1, builders have to choose either of the options for which they will get time,"" revenue secretary A B Pandey told reporters after the 34th meeting of the GST council here.

Finance minister Arun Jaitley chaired the meeting with state finance ministers via video conferencing.

On the time-frame for transition, Pandey pointed out that the council has agreed on providing a reasonable time to developers.

The matter would be decided in a next few days in consultation with the states, he said, adding that it could be 15 days or one month.

Pandey further said that the decision will help the builders in clearing inventories.

""This go-ahead by the GST council brings quite a relief for this sector in handling transition issues in specific,"" EY India partner Abhishek Jain said.

For upcoming projects, reduced rates of 5 per cent and 1 per cent will be applicable beginning April 1.

On the next GST council meeting, the revenue secretary said that is unlikely till the election process is over.

He, however, said that if any emergent situation arises then a meeting could be called with the permission of the Election Commission.

On apprehensions being raised on possible price rise due to new tax structure, the secretary said if prices escalate, the national anti-profiteering authority will look into it and take an appropriate action.

Deloitte India partner M S Mani said the pragmatic move to segregate under construction projects from new projects would provide relief to builders who were worried about the loss of Input Tax Credit.

""This would also enable them to price the loss of input tax credits in the new projects. Reversal of Input tax credit on a proportionate basis would entail significant computational issues for builders as each project would be in various stages of construction and have differing pre and post completion sale patterns,"" Mani said.

Lyft raises IPO price target as investor fret over missing out - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Lyft Inc on Wednesday raised the price range for its initial public offering, as investors looked past the ride-hailing startup's mounting losses to the company's growing market share against larger rival Uber Technologies Inc.


Lyft raised its IPO price range to between $70 and $72 per share, meaning the ride-hailing company is now targeting a valuation of up to $24.3 billion. The increased range, from $62-$68 previously, is the result of investors worrying about missing out on the biggest U.S. IPO since Snap Inc in 2017.

Lyft's IPO was oversubscribed just two days into its investor roadshow, Reuters reported last week.

At the upper end of the new range, Lyft would have a market capitalization of $20.45 billion, a little larger than Snap Inc when it went public in 2017. At this size, it would be the biggest US IPO since Chinese e-commerce Alibaba Group Holding Ltd in 2014.

Counting for things like restricted stock options, Lyft's valuation would be as high as $24.3 billion. Lyft was valued at $15 billion in final private fundraising round in 2018.

At the mid-point of its new target range, $71 per share, Lyft would raise roughly $2.1 billion.

The increased price range signals a healthy appetite for new stocks after jeans maker Levi Strauss & Co last week priced its targeted range and popped on its market debut.

It also indicates many investors are willing to overlook uncertainty over Lyft's path to profitability and its strategy for autonomous driving, for fear of missing out on such a high-profile technology IPO.

The IPO market had a slow start in 2019 due to volatile markets at the end of last year and the government shutdown in January blocking U.S. regulators from processing new IPO applicants.

This all bodes well for the likes of Uber Technologies and Pinterest Inc, which are also planning to go public in 2019 but like Lyft have yet to turn a profit.

With start-ups like Lyft staying private for longer, there is a backlog of demand to allocate more money to stocks which are considered high-growth in order to diversify away from Wall Street's FAANG trade which is made up of Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Netflix Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc.

Nevertheless, Lyft's strategy and ability to make money has not been without skeptics.

Union pension fund adviser CtW Investment Group has argued Lyft ""faces an all-but-insurmountable barrier"" to profitability due to issues with the ride-hailing company's pricing strategy and new regulations driving costs higher.

Lyft's revenue was $2.16 billion for 2018, double the previous year's and far higher than $343 million in 2016. It posted a loss of $911 million in 2018 versus $688 million in 2017.

Lyft's IPO is set to price on Thursday with shares scheduled to begin trading on the Nasdaq on Friday.

‘A golden visa can save you from going to jail at home’ - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: On Friday, diamantaire Nirav Modi will appear in a London court for his second plea for bail. Modi has been held in a UK prison since his first court appearance on March 20, when he was denied bail.


Nirav Modi had entered the UK on a ‘golden visa’, issued by the British government on his Indian passport, which was revoked in February this year. The golden visa, issued to investors outside the EU on a commitment to invest £2 million (Rs 18 crore) in UK government bonds or in active and trading UK companies, was apparently issued to Nirav Modi a few years ago. Revocation of passport does not affect the validity of the visa.

In court last week, the defence lawyer said he arrived in the UK in January 2018 and that is a key plank of their defence.

Reforms in rules for UK’s golden visas will also be implemented from March 29. Golden visas aim to encourage rich non-EU citizens to make substantial investments in the UK economy, by offering them the right to live, work, study and settle in Britain. But, the scheme has faced criticism, with some questioning the legitimacy of funds used to make investments.

UK government bonds, which were also a qualifying investment (or option for investment), will be excluded from March 29. UK banks will need to carry out all due diligence checks on an applicant, and applicants will now need to have held the £2 million they will invest for at least two years before making their application, or provide evidence of the source of funds. Earlier it was 90 days. Due diligence checks are done to protect from possibility of money laundering, organised crime and funding of terrorism.

This visa route was introduced in 2008 and brings 498 million euros (Rs 3,897 crore) into the UK every year. By 2018, 10,445 such visas had been granted, of which 82 were given to Indians, according to a 2018 report ‘European Getaway: Inside the Murky World of Golden Visas” by Transparency International and Global Witness.

But the report said that between 2008 and 2015 the UK Tier 1 (investor) scheme had “undertaken minimal checks on applicants’ wealth.” “Applicants were given visas before they opened a UK bank account. A number of banks interpreted the fact that individuals had been given a visa as verification from the UK Home Office that an applicant’s wealth was legitimate. Realising their mistake, the Home Office reformed the programme in April 2015. Now, applicants have to open a bank account before applying for the visa,” the report said.

But during this period, 3,000 high net-worth individuals entered the UK “with at least £3.15 billion of questionable legitimacy,” the report said, describing golden visa schemes “are highly desirable for those associated with corruption”.

“In the event that circumstances back home become unfavourable, a golden visa can effectively serve as a get out-of-jail-free card,” the report stated.

The Home Office announced on December 6, 2018, that this visa route was to be temporarily suspended, amid fears it was being used for money laundering. But after lobbying by firms that sell the visas, it was not suspended. On December 11, the Home Office said, “The Tier 1 (Investor) visa is not currently suspended, however, we remain committed to reforming the route.”

Luke Hexter, managing director of Knightsbridge Capital Partners in London, who sells such schemes, said, “The Home Office initially said it would suspend the route, as part of its ongoing efforts to tackle serious organised crime and money laundering. But it seems to have been rebutted by higher level government. We believe the reforms brought forward by the UK government will be effective, thus ensuring only reputable and trustworthy applicants will continue to be accepted into the UK tier 1 investor programme.”

On March 7, 2019, the Home Office issued a statement saying it was “bringing forward reforms to the route.” “The reformed route will better protect the UK from illegally obtained funds, while ensuring that genuine investors have access to a viable visa route,” it read.


Steps to a golden visa

1) You needed to invest at least £2m (Rs 18 crore) in active and trading UK registered companies or UK govt bonds

2) Prove you have held the £2m for at least 90 days, amount must stay invested for visa to remain valid

3) Account with a UK regulated bank for investing £2m

4) A UK address to open a bank account

5) Investors do not need to speak English to get a Tier 1 (investor visa) because, while you are allowed to work if you wish to, you do not have to

6) Investors can apply from overseas and remain overseas. Visa can be used to travel in and out of UK, or keep it in your passport as an option

7) Applicants must provide an overseas criminal record certificate for any country they’ve been present in continuously or cumulatively for 12 months or more, in the 10 years prior to their application

8) Need to have fingerprints and photograph taken at a visa centre to get a biometric residence permit


After March 29 reforms

1) Investments in UK govt bonds will no longer qualify as permitted UK investments

2) Applicants will have to prove they have had control of the £2 million they will invest for at least two years before applying, or provide evidence of the source of funds

3) UK banks will need to carry out “Know Your Client” checks and provide a statement confirming this has been done in the bank letter required for the application

4) Stronger evidence will be required that a company has a substantial presence in the UK, including registration with the Companies House and HMRC for corporation tax and payas-you-earn purposes. The company must have at least two UK-based employees, who are not its directors

Jet Airways News: Planes grounded, Jet Airways sends expat pilots on leave without pay 

","
NEW DELHI: 

  Jet Airways
 + has started sending its pilots - most likely only the expats - on furloughs, or leaves without pay. Expat pilots cost nearly twice as much as their Indian counterparts as they have to be given accommodation and flight tickets to their home country every few weeks. Since Jet is now operating 35 of its once-upon-a-time fleet of 124 planes, the lender-led management has begun cutting this extra cost. The airline is trying to take this number to 75 by April 26, still leaving it pilot surplus.


Sources say only expat pilots are being sent on furlough. Despite repeated attempts, Jet did not comment on how many expats it has and if the offer is being made to them only. 



With just one-fourth of operational fleet, Jet suspends services to 13 international routes till end-AprilJet Airways has suspended operations on 13 more international routes till end-April and grounded seven more planes due to non-payment of rentals, taking the number of such aircraft to 54. The airline has also reduced frequencies on seven other overseas routes, mostly from Delhi and Mumbai. From 600 daily flights operations reduced to one-fourth.


""Due to the reduced network and fleet plan, the company's pilot requirements on your fleet have reduced and your services will not be required… as an interim arrangement, we are offering furlough to pilots. Accordingly, we hereby offer you furlough of your employment with effect from April 01, 2019 till further notice,"" a letter issued to an expat pilot of Boeing 737 on Thursday said.

""Please consider this letter as notice to furlough your employment with us. We will periodically assess pilot requirements and advise you accordingly,"" it adds. During the furlough, pilots will not not receive salary, any other monetary benefit, accommodation and medical insurance. 

""However, you will continue to be eligible for free passages as per the prevailing staff travel policy of the company. You shall maintain recency / validity of your licenses / medical during the period of furlough. In case your employment contract ceases during the term of this furlough arrangement, the furlough arrangement contemplated herein shall automatically come to an end on the date of cessation of the employment contract,"" the letter says.

In the last two months, Jet has seen several of its pilots leave. They along with aircraft engineers and senior management are awaiting payment of last three to four months' salaries. 

Expat pilots have always been a touchy issue in almost all Indian carriers. Last August when Jet had proposed 15 per cent pay cut for pilots, the airline had even then issued ad to hire expats. When Indian pilots questioned the move of cutting their salaries yet continuing to hire expats, the then management had said salary of expat pilots would also be deducted. The salary deduction move did not happen and the airline later was not in a position to pay salaries to the level of employees with big pay packages.

Asian central banks look to cut rates after Fed pause - Times of India

","
SEOUL/HONG KONG: A slowing global economy and abrupt end to Federal Reserve policy tightening have shifted rate cut expectations in Asia to probable from possible, with the market betting on moves by a growing list of central banks.


New Zealand sent the clearest signal on Wednesday when its central bank kept interest rates at a record low of 1.75%, but said a weak external environment meant its next move was more likely to be a cut. Money markets are pricing in a strong chance of a cut in Australia this year. The Philippines, India and Indonesia also have room to reverse some of last year’s multiple interest rate hikes aimed at protecting the peso, rupee and rupiah from emerging market turmoil, economists say.

In Malaysia, rate cut calls are growing louder as inflation has turned negative, while policy makers in Japan debated further stimulus amid concerns over waning global demand, according to minutes from the Bank of Japan’s March meeting.

A new and unexpected member of the club of potential rate cutters is South Korea, where the government bond yield curve has flattened rapidly, signaling economic weakness that economists believe the Bank of Korea may address.

In China, although reductions in bank reserve requirements are seen as Beijing’s main monetary policy easing tool, some analysts also expect cuts in benchmark rates.

“This shifting growth-inflation mix combined with a concluded Fed tightening cycle calls for a significant change in the course of monetary policy across Asian economies,” ANZ economists said in a quarterly note on Wednesday. “We now expect all central banks in the region to either hold interest rates or move into accommodation mode,” they said.

This is a remarkable turnaround. Only last year, the debate in trade-deficit countries was about how high rates could go, and Japan’s central bank was contemplating exiting stimulus policies.

Heineken buys 74L shares of UBHL from ED - Times of India

","
BENGALURU: Dutch beer maker Heineken has emerged as the buyer of the 74 lakh shares of United Breweries Holding (UBHL) from the ED which fetched the government agency Rs 1,008 crore earlier this week, sources said.

The shares, which are equivalent to 2.8% stake in United Breweries once helmed by Vijay Mallya, will help push up Heineken’s hold over India’s largest beer maker to about 46%. 

Heineken has been trying for years to get a majority stake in UB—51%—but have been futile since Mallya’s entire holding has been attached. UB and Heineken could not be reached immediately for comment. The shares were pledged by Mallya to Yes Bank as security against loans taken by Kingfisher Airlines. The money amassed will help the consortium of lenders, led by SBI, to recover loans turned non performing assets (NPA) worth Rs 9,000 crore. The ED has already identified properties worth Rs 12,500 crore including Rs 9,000 crore already attached under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

In 2016, Heineken had bought similar pledged shares from banks and other lenders. Mallya and his holding companies still hold 13.8% of United Breweries, as per the latest shareholding pattern in December 2018, but with the current share sale, it will come down to about 11%

Take stock of your wealth: Make reviewing portfolio a ritual - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: March is the month for money. We scramble to complete transactions, and prepare to file tax returns. We regret a few decisions and hope to do better next year. Here are some reminders I set for myself at this time of the year.


First, do not let money idle while waiting for the right time and ideal investment opportunity. Have a default investment plan. It can be an index you like, a set of funds you have tracked, or your favourite set of stocks. Put your money to work.

Second, do not associate investing with activity. We feel there has to be constant monitoring, buying and selling, to be successful investors. Your investment strategy must be simple and easy to implement.

Third, make annual portfolio review a ritual. Devote time to finding out what is working and what is not. Put down the current value of all your assets. Get a sense of whether your money is aligned to your long-term goals.

Fourth, own up to mistakes and make corrections. When something is performing well, we are anxious to book profit and lock it. Likewise, if something is not working, we usually let it lie as it is. Think what this does to our money. It is important to focus on the portfolio as a whole.

Fifth, think through the annual liquidity plan. If there are large expense coming up, it is risky to assume that we can sell off equity investments to meet it. Instead, move the money into low-risk investments like bank deposits and short-term debt and liquid funds to meet such needs. Plan ahead for large requirements.

Sixth, review credit card spends. What we spend over and above the mandatory living expenses are reflected in our credit card statements. Taking a look at the numbers will help you see which habits are affordable and which ones are not.

Seventh, think about financial decisions you regret. We make decisions with our human flaws and sometimes there is a pattern. Take the time at least once annually to consider, so you can fix them.

Eighth, keep your investment machine running well. Complete the nomination forms; correct the email address on your folios, etc. These are little tasks we postpone, then when crisis hits, we realise we failed to fix a small detail. This can be solved by devoting an hour once a year.

Ninth, file those income tax returns. Take professional help if needed. You enjoy an encumbered use of your income, after a simple act of declaring what your sources of income are, and paying taxes that are due. We celebrate so many annual events like birthdays and anniversaries. Celebrate your wealth and do the rituals that keep it going, at least once a year.

‘Premature to estimate direct tax shortfall’ - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: The tax department has said it is premature to estimate any shortfall in direct tax receipts for the current financial year, which ends in March and said the actual picture would be known by the middle of April.


Reports have suggested that the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has shot off a letter to field formations to go all out to bridge the shortfall in direct taxes. The reports have said that direct tax receipts may fall short by 15% of the target.

""This is a routine letter we send out to field formations in the third quarter of the financial year,"" said an official, who did not wish to be identified.

""How can we guess what the shortfall is? Taxes keep coming till April 1 and residuary taxes until April 15,"" the official said, adding that the final picture will emerge early next month. Earlier this year, CBDT had expressed confidence about meeting the target of Rs 11.5 lakh crore for current fiscal year.

Amrapali group diverted Rs 3,000 crore of homebuyers' money: Auditors to Supreme Court - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Seven months after the Supreme Court ordered a forensic audit of 

  Amrapali group
 + to track misuse of homebuyers' money, the final report said illegal diversion of over Rs 3,000 crore led to the financial collapse of the group, leaving thousands of investors stranded.


The auditors, Ravi Bhatia and Pawan Aggarwal, filed a voluminous report running into more than 2,000 pages in the SC. They said the group set up more than 100 shell companies in the names of its officials, including one in which a peon was inducted in a senior position, to divert money which was used for personal gain of directors, officials and their relatives.



SC sends Amrapali CMD, 2 directors to police custody for cheating homebuyers


The report made it evident that the collapse of the Amrapali group was not due to a change in market conditions or investment decisions gone bad but because of the wilful criminal actions of the group's proprietors. The court had directed a forensic audit in September last year.

Justice Arun Mishra, who along with Justice UU Lalit is hearing the plea of thousands of homebuyers, informed their lawyer ML Lahoti on Thursday that the auditors had filed their report and the court would examine it on April 9.

Around 46,000 people had invested in Amrapali's housing projects but were not given flats. The buyers sought the SC's protection after the lender bank initiated insolvency proceedings against the company. The court then decided to supervise construction and assured buyers that their interest will be protected and sought a forensic audit of 46 registered companies to track funds and beneficiaries.

The court's apprehension that the group siphoned off homebuyer money proved correct with the forensic report finding ""documentary evidence"" to show that funds were transferred to more than 100 shell companies outside Amrapali group through dubious transactions. The money was invested in mutual funds, LIC policies and for expansion of business other than construction activity.

The auditors also gave a list of dubious and benami homebuyers in whose names flats worth lakhs of rupees were booked on payment of paltry sums.

FIR against Singh brothers on cheating, conspiracy - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Delhi Police's economic offence wing has registered an FIR against promoters of Religare Enterprises (REL) after they were found to have defaulted in repaying a loan of Rs 2,397 crore.


Police officers said that during the probe, it was found that there were inter-linkages between borrowers as funds were routed from one borrower to another. It was also found that the loan amount ultimately came back to the same group companies.

An FIR under sections of cheating, criminal breach of trust and criminal conspiracy was registered against Malvinder Singh, Shivinder Singh, Sunil Godhwani and N K Ghosal from REL on the basis of a complaint from a senior manager of the Religare Finvest (RFL). REL was controlled by the Singh brothers until February 2018. After their exit, boards of REL and RFL were reconstituted.

The complaint mentioned that the loans taken by the companies owned by the four men had left RFL in a poor financial condition. Additional CP (EOW) Suvashis Chowdhary confirmed that a probe has been initiated. ""All of them wilfully defaulted in repayments of the loan and caused wrongful loss to the company RFL,"" said the complaint. After an inquiry, the RBI had also pointed out these discrepancies, mentioning that top borrowers of RFL under corporate loan book (CLB) portfolio were related entities. The alleged were major shareholders till June 2017 and remained in control of the companies till February 2018.

Income support scheme can be realised by cutting other doles: Y V Reddy - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Congress President Rahul Gandhi's minimum income support scheme for the poor can be implemented by curtailing other doles and allowing fiscal deficit to widen, former RBI governor Y V Reddy said. However, it would be difficult for state governments to implement a similar scheme as they largely depend on the Centre for finance and borrowing limit, he told in an interview. 


""I talk only in terms of central-state fiscal relations. The state governments have budget constraints that means state governments can't spend more money because borrowing requires permission of the government of India. So, there is a limit (for state borrowing). If they implement some schemes like this (minimum income support scheme) that has to be within their own budget limit,"" he said. 

However, he said, the Centre has some liberty to increase fiscal deficit and there is no such hard fiscal constraints. 

""So, such programmes are implemented better if the Centre takes over. If the Centre is able to accommodate it within the budget, FRBM (Fiscal Responsibility And Budget Management Act) target, then you can't object...if government of India says they will cut other expenditures based on their relative priorities, it can do it,"" he said. 

In a big bang election promise, the Congress earlier this week announced that 20 per cent families belonging to the poorest category will be given Rs 72,000 each annually as minimum income if his party comes to power. 

""Final assault on poverty has begun. We will wipe out poverty from the country,"" Gandhi had said, adding the Congress has studied the fiscal implications of the scheme and consulted renowned economists and experts before finalising the scheme. 

Asked if there can be sharing of the Centre and states for implementation of such scheme, Reddy said it could lead to complication. 

Reddy has co-authored with IES officer G R Reddy a book titled 'Indian Fiscal Federalism'. 

According to this book, several developments in recent years point to the emergence of a new era in fiscal federalism, the contours are still unfolding. 

The book highlighted some of the developments like setting up of the GST council, reduction of flexibility for states in revenue generation along with an increased burden of expenditure and contentious terms of reference of fifteenth finance commission. 

""The GST council is a shining example of cooperative fiscal federalism at its best,"" it said. 

While the arrangement is yet to stand the test of time, the functioning so far gives rise to hope that it will be a pillar of strength on the indirect revenue side, just as the finance commission is on the revenue expenditure side of the centre-state fiscal relations, the book said.

Air India asks pilots to stop ordering special meals & take regular ones - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Air India has barred its pilots from ordering special meals for themselves and asked them to take the regular meals ordered by the airline. Flight caterers say it is a regular practice to get special meal requests from AI pilots, something that ranges from whatever they may wish including very expensive meals. Special meals will be allowed only for medical reasons.


AI’s director operations, captain Amitabh Singh, wrote a mail to pilots saying: “It has been brought to (his) notice that flight crew are ordering special meal/s which is against rules. The only crew, who for medical reasons, may order for special meals, (that is) food recommended by doctor. (as per rules) ‘crew should adhere to the meal schedules laid down by the company and should not authorise meal uplift on their own’.”

“In light of the above, all cockpit crew (pilots) are instructed not to order special meals as and when operating a flight / staff on duty movement. GM-catering to take note of the same and issue necessary instructions to all dealing heads. GM-catering to liaise with office of ED-operations to get a list of pilots, who will be requiring special food for medical purposes only. ED-operations to get the above instructions uploaded on crew portal on priority,” captain Singh’s order says.

Airline sources say cockpit crew routinely orders burgers, biryani, lassi, soup and desserts from catering. “They very often send a mail listing their meal preference to catering department before operating flights. These extra pilot meals tend to be costlier than the meals ordered by airline and had to be sent over and above the normally uplifted crew meals,” say sources.

South Korea’s Mirae leads $150 million round in BigBasket - Times of India

","
BENGALURU: South Korea’s Mirae Asset Management and UK’s development finance institution CDC Group, along with Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, have invested $150 million in online grocer BigBasket, according to filings made by the company with ministry of corporate affairs. The round has valued BigBasket at close to $1.2 billion, marking its entry into the unicorn club of private companies valued over $1 billion.


After the deal, Mirae, which invested $60 million, will hold around 5%, while CDC, which infused $40 million, will hold a 3.5% stake in the company. Existing backer Alibaba’s shareholding will slightly go up to around 26% after putting $50 million in this round. BigBasket had last raised $300 million, led by Alibaba in February last year, a deal which had valued the company at $900 million at that time. 

The new round of funding comes as the online grocery market is heating up with the potential entry of Reliance Industries in the e-commerce space. Walmart-backed Flipkart and Amazon India have also been pushing into the category, and SoftBank recently invested another $60 million in Gurgaon-based Grofers, which has stepped up focus on private labels.

The company has been busy making acquisitions with the capital raised, as it looks to make ordering from the platform a daily habit. It acquired Pune-based Raincan and Bengaluru-headquartered Morningcart, two startups who deliver daily essential products like milk and bread in the morning. It also acquired smart vending machine startup Kwik24. 

BigBasket reported around 34% increase in its revenues to Rs 1,606 crore in the financial year ending March 2018, while it controlled losses, which fell by 53% to Rs 310 crore. 

The company was founded in 2011 by Hari Menon, Vipul Parekh, Abhinay Chaudhary and V S Sudhakar.

Levi’s soars in return as public company - Times of India

","
Levi Strauss & Co soared in its return as a public company, in the biggest test so far this year of a slow-to-warm up market for US listings.

The iconic apparel maker’s initial public offering, with its shares jumping as much as much as 36% the first day of trading, showed investors are ready to buy into a company that wants to be known for more than just denim.


“The fact that the stock opened up so dramatically does show the appetite for this brand both by investors and also consumers,” Levi Strauss CEO Chip Bergh — wearing a pair of Levi’s jeans — said in an interview at the New York Stock Exchange.

Early indications had suggested the share sale was going well: Investors were advised to place their orders above the marketed price range to avoid missing out, a person familiar with the matter said earlier.

Levi Strauss shares opened at $22 apiece on Thursday after the company raised $623 million selling almost 37 million shares at $17 apiece, above the marketed range of $14 to $16. The shares closed at $22, up 32% from the offer price, giving the San Franciscobased company a market value of more than $8.6 billion.

Outside NYSE on Thursday, a large red sign displayed the Levi’s name and #Livein-Levis. Inside, workers took advantage of the temporary suspension of the exchange’s “no jeans” policy to mark the IPO. People arrived outfitted in light-washed blue jean jackets, dark blue jeans and denim shirts.

The amount raised makes Levi Strauss’s listing the largest on a US exchange so far this year—at least until Lyft’s offering set for next week. The ride-hailing company is seeking to be valued at $19.6 billion, or as much as $23.3 billion including some restricted equity units for employees and others that aren’t yet fully available to them.

Lyft will price shares in its already oversubscribed offering on March 28, with larger rival Uber Technologies Inc. lined up to follow before the end of the first half. Uber could be valued at as much as $120 billion, people familiar with the matter have said.

India’s mobile data is cheapest globally - Times of India

","
CHENNAI: A large data-hungry base of smartphone users and a fierce price war between the country’s telcos has made India home to the cheapest mobile data price in the world.


One gigabyte (1GB) of data costs $0.26 in India, compared to an average $6.66 in the UK and $12.37 in the US, finds a global analysis of mobile data prices by UK-based price comparison portal Cable. It compared data from 6,313 mobile data plans in 230 countries between October and November 2018 for the study.

For instance, there is a 97% difference in the price of 1GB of data between India and the US, while the gap in the 2018 edition of the Big Mac index (a quirky measure of purchasing power parity between nations using the price of McDonald’s Big Mac burgers) between the two countries is far narrower at 54%.




Asia makes up half of the top 20 cheapest mobile data prices in the world, with the average price of 1GB less than a dollar in Sri Lanka, Mongolia, Myanmar and Bangladesh. On the other hand, Zimbabwe is the most expensive country for mobile data as 1GB there costs $75.2, the survey said.

“A country whose young population has a particularly high technological awareness, India offers a vibrant smartphone market, with strong adoption and many competitors. Data, therefore, is quite staggeringly cheap,” Dan Howdle, consumer telecom analyst at Cable.co.uk, said.

Without specifying why India ranks first, the study said the cheapest countries either have “excellent mobile and fixed broadband infrastructure”, or have a large user base reliant on mobile data. The large cost differential for mobile internet between India and other countries is primarily driven by a crowded and competitive telecom sector and is not just a factor of purchasing power.

Data prices in India have historically been lower than global benchmarks, given the sheer number of service providers. The entry of Jio has only made competition fiercer, forcing telcos to bring down tariffs.

“We can see a significant drop in the price of mobile internet after the entry of Jio as the telco aggressively priced its data on the back of a stronger 4G infrastructure,” Ankit Chhajer, co-founder of tariffs comparison startup Komparify, told TOI. A 1GB 4G data pack was available at around Rs 250 pre-Jio, and the same is now available at as low as Rs 48, Chhajer said, He pointed out an almost 80% fall in prices of mobile data since the entry of Jio.

As for the trajectory of data tariffs, Rajan S Mathews, DG of Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), noted that pricing has largely been stable recently, and there may not be any noticeable hikes in the near future. “Now the sector is balanced with three major private telcos and one public sector operator BSNL/MTNL,” said Mathews.

Tata Sons not to demerge Tata Tele’s enterprise biz - Times of India

","
MUMBAI: In a U-turn, Tata Sons has decided to keep the enterprise business of Tata Teleservices separate and not merge it with Tata Communications. The plan is to scale up the business and later evaluate strategic options for the unit. 


The current thinking is that the enterprise business will be run separately, as a lot of value needs to be created. Furthermore, Tata Communications has its own challenges, like deals being stuck for want of regulatory approvals, said a source. In 2017, Tata Sons had announced plans to combine the enterprise unit of Tata Teleservices with Tata Communications as part of a broader strategy to reduce exposure to the beleaguered telecom sector.

The latest change in strategy is because of apprehensions in getting customary and regulatory approvals for the merger within an estimated time frame. For instance, the source added, Tata Communications is yet to conclude its decade-long plan of demerging surplus land into a separate company as this is also pending approvals. 

And then, Tata Communications must get a nod for the acquisition of the enterprise business from the telecom department, shareholders, etc. With the general elections coming up and the formation of the government after that, the transaction will take time to conclude. Rather than wait for the processes to be completed, it was decided to retain the business separately, the source further said. The government is a key shareholder in Tata Communications with a stake of 26%.

Tata Sons had earlier decided to merge both the enterprise units of Tata Teleservices and Tata Communications as it will help consolidate the business under one roof. Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran has been advocating mergers within the $111 billion conglomerate, especially of companies that are into similar or adjacent areas of operations, as it will simplify the group’s corporate structure. 

For the proposed merger transaction, Tata Communications had also appointed Axis Capital to undertake the valuation of the enterprise business of Tata Teleservices. Previously, former Tata brand custodian Mukund Rajan, along with a leading private equity firm, had offered $1 billion to acquire the enterprise business. But this proposal was turned down by Tata Sons.

Besides the enterprise unit of Tata Teleservices, the rest of the businesses of the company, the consumer mobile and fixed-line & broadband, will be merged with Bharti Airtel and Tata Sky, respectively. The wireless telecom unit’s deal with Airtel is awaiting approval too. With regard to Tata Sky, after the amalgamation of the fixed-line & broadband business, the company has become a part of the group’s larger play in retail, said the source.

Apple's Tim Cook urges China to continue to open up its economy - Times of India

","
BEIJING: Apple chief executive Tim Cook on Saturday urged China to keep opening up its economy as local rivals bit into the profits of the US tech giant caught in the crosshairs of a trade spat between Beijing and Washington.


""We have seen China continue to change and evolve... We encourage China to continue to open up,"" he said during a speech at the annual China Development Forum in Beijing.

""We see that as essential not only for China to reach its full potential, but also for the global economy to thrive.""

Apple in January revealed that it took a hit in the ""Greater China"" region, where revenue plunged almost 27 per cent in the most recent quarter.

The dip had been expected following the company's revenue warning in December, where Apple admitted that iPhone sales and overall earnings would be below most forecasts, citing economic weakness in China and trade frictions between Washington and Beijing.

Lower priced local rivals such as Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo have also been nibbling at the California tech giant's market share in China.

Cook has been a critic of the US-China trade war that has spooked global markets. Last year, he used the China Development Forum as a venue to urge leaders of China and the US to let ""calm heads prevail"" and to avoid an escalation of tariffs.

Most of Apple's flagship products are assembled in China, leaving the California tech giant acutely vulnerable to Trump's tariffs.

During his speech, Cook called for partnerships based on ""openness and trust"" where world players can work together to solve some of the biggest problems facing the planet including poverty, inequality and climate change.

HDFC Bank opposes SBI’s plea to restore Vijay Mallya’s property - Times of India

","
MUMBAI: HDFC Bank has opposed the SBI-led consortium of banks’ plea seeking the restoration of absconding accused Vijay Mallya’s properties to it. In its reply submitted before the special Prevention of Money Laundering (PMLA) Act judge MS Azmi, the bank said that the SBI-led consortium of banks “do not hold security interest or any other protectable interest over the attached properties.”


HDFC Bank further submitted that SBI had not disclosed the pending proceedings before the Supreme Court, which were initiated at SBI’s behest. “These proceedings impact the tenability of any reliefs that may affect HDFC Bank,” the lender said. 

It explained that UBHL and Kingfisher Finvest India (KFIL) had pledged about 65.85 lakh shares of USL (United Spirits) to HDFC Bank to secure loans. 

The bank further submitted that on May 24, 2013, the Karnataka high court permitted UBHL to sell a large block of shares of USL to Diageo and directed that the creditors were to be paid from the proceeds. HDFC Bank said that it agreed to release its charge over 15.85 lakh of its USL shares and received Rs 135 crore.

However, SBI challenged the order and the court partially set aside the May 2013 order, pending the UBHL winding up petition. It however did not grant SBI’s plea seeking a refund of Rs 135 crore. 

HDFC Bank said that SBI had challenged this in the Supreme Court and the petition was pending. 

It further stated that considering this, the liability of UBHL and KFIL towards HDFC Bank was uncertain. “Applicants (SBI-led consortium of banks) cannot claim a better right or title over HDFC Bank’s specific prior charge rights and the contention, that the dues of HDFC Bank are not adjudicated and hence they cannot claim right over the shares of USL, is baseless and unfounded,” HDFC Bank said.

Google Pay looks for expansion - Times of India

","
BENGALURU: Eighteen months after its India launch, Google Pay aims to expand into smaller cities by partnering merchant acquirers Pine Labs and Innovity who will enable over two lakh shops to accept payment through the app. Google Pay users will also be able to buy gold and make financial investments.


Google’s renewed push comes at a time when rivals Phonepe and Paytm are expanding their offline merchant network to on-board first-time internet users from smaller towns and villages. Earlier, Google Pay had incorporated ticket booking by integrating Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation’s (IRCTC) systems in the app.

The partnership with the aggregators will allow store owners to send a payment request using the Google Pay user’s mobile number. Upon authentication by the customer, the payment will be processed instantly. Both PhonePe and Paytm already sell gold on their platforms. Google’s entry will increase competition in this space. Paytm having launched a separate wealth management platform under Paytm Money has a lead. PhonePe is rolling out mutual funds investment options on its app in a phased manner. Google Pay’s expansion comes on the back of a rising number of users transacting every month on its platform. From a base of 14 million monthly active users in March last year, the company claims to have expanded the same to 45 million currently. PhonePe has about 50 million monthly active users while the same for Paytm would be upwards of 60 million. After completing one year of operations in September last year, Google Pay had 25 million monthly active users. 

“Based on the transactions in the last month, we are at an annual run-rate of $81 billion-worth payments happening on our platform. With partnerships like Pine Labs, our presence will get boosted across all retail point of sales,” said Ambarish Kenghe, director, product management, Google Pay India. 

Present on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), Google sees the majority of its payments in peer-to-peer (P2P) channel compared to merchant payments. Google does not give the break-up of its P2P payments and merchant payments. Kenghe said merchant payments will grow further with new payment channel partnerships kicking-in. Overall on UPI, merchant payments are in the range of 20-25% of total transactions so far. “Last year, over 100 million customers bought products and services from our merchant network. With Google Pay, we expect to reach many new groups of customers across the country,” said Pine Labs CEO Vicky Bindra.

SPR CITY: THE COMPLETE PACKAGE FOR HOME BUYERS - Times of India

","
 From design, to comfort, to convenience, to interiors, home buyers look for a complete package today. Other factors that consumers take into consideration are the credibility of the developer, adherence to promises made, architecture and the quality of the building itself. Developers have realized that and are packing in as much as they can to satisfy the requirements of consumers. Today, residential projects that are nearing completion stage emerge as the top choice for prospective home buyers, surpassing the popularity of ready to move-in homes. The reason? For one, most people find the burden of paying upfront for a ready-to-move-in apartment too heavy. Add to that the heavy interests that need to be paid on a home loan which proves to be a huge financial drain that most people try to steer clear of. SPR Highliving is a prime example of a developer that is dedicated to delivering properties equipped with world-class amenities and built with the highest quality. One of the feats that the brand has achieved recently is to complete the construction of 36 floors in just 365 days in Tower-A. Located within SPR City, Chennai's largest integrated township, Tower-A is a part of its residential phase, Highliving District. Two other structures, Tower-B of 36 floors and Tower-H of 45 floors are also currently under construction and are fast rising. Considered Chennai's Tallest Towers, these magnificent structures are a paradigm of engineering excellence and architectural finesse. Designed to global benchmarks, these residential towers promise its residents a high quality of living and are currently one of the best investment options in the city.  Mr. Hitesh Kawad, Managing Director, SPR Highliving  says, ""The idea is to deliver holistic living to the residents of SPR City aligned with the concept of Work-Live-Learn-Play-Commune. Right from a school to a mall to office spaces, SPR City has it all and is envisioned as a 'City within a City' that redefines urban living.""  Here are twelve factors that make SPR City the complete package for prospective home buyers:  1) Location: 'Location, location, location!' - the age-old adage still holds good for prime real estate properties. Being situated just two kilometers from Kilpauk and in close proximity to areas such as Purusawalkam and Vepery, SPR City makes a very prime location.  2) Green Cover: SPR City houses one of the largest green spaces that can be accommodated within a project. It boasts of more than five lakh square feet of sprawling greenery and wide-open spaces.  3) Amenities: SPR City offers more than 65 high-end amenities to its residents. Right from a swimming pool, to a fencing area, to a mini-theatre to a spa, the choices are endless.  4) The View: Undoubtedly, the tallest towers in the city of Chennai, this essentially means that the view would be breathtaking. Whether it is the fourteenth floor or the thirtieth floor, one can soak in a picturesque view of the city at any part of the day or night.  5) Accessibility: SPR City is located in one of the most accessible areas of the city. The proposed metro stations at Pattalam, Otteri, and Perambur are just a minute away. It is approachable by road on all four sides, making it easily accessible from all major hubs of the city.  6) School: Residents of SPR City can get priority admission in Shri Ram Universal School, an academic institution of high repute, which is located within SPR City.

'Nyay' scheme poses 'fiscal challenge' to India's economy: Arvind Panagariya - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: Former Niti Aayog vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya has said the implementation of the Congress Party's ambitious 'Nyay' scheme not only poses a ""fiscal challenge"" to India's economy but also has a ""serious incentive problem"".


Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said that its minimum income guarantee scheme, 'Nyuntam Aay Yojana' (Nyay) assures up to Rs 72,000 a year or Rs 6,000 a month income to 20 per cent of India's poorest families if the party is voted back to power in the Lok Sabha elections next month.



We will 'remonetise' what Modi 'demonetised', says Rahul GandhiRahul Gandhi on Thursday said the 'Nyay' scheme will remonetise what PM Modi demonetised and asserted that his party's anti-poverty programme has thrown the BJP into total disarray. The Congress president said the 'Nyay' scheme has the twin objectives of giving money to the 20% poorest families and remonetising the economy ""damaged"" by demonetisation.


Panagariya, who served as the first vice-chairman of Niti Aayog for two years from 2015 to 2017, told PTI that 'Nyay' is difficult to implement and unlikely to achieve its intended objective.

""It raises three major questions - the incentive compatibility issue, the fairness issue and fiscal challenge,"" Panagariya, an eminent Indian-American economist, said.

But Gandhi said the 'Nyay' scheme has the twin objectives of giving money to the 20 per cent poorest families and remonetising the economy damaged by the demonetisation in 2016.

Its aim is two-fold. First is to guarantee a minimum income to the bottom 20 per cent families. The second is to remonetise the economy that has been demonetised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gandhi told PTI.

Senior Congress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram on Wednesday said 'enough' economists and experts had been consulted and they broadly agreed that India has the capacity to implement the scheme.

Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has said the implementation of the scheme is possible, Chidambaram said.

""Our calculation shows that it will not cross 2 per cent of the GDP, it will be 1.8 per cent of the GDP at any given point of time,"" he said.

Commenting on the scheme, Panagariya said the transfer is meant to be Rs 6,000 per month per family to 50 million families and at the same time, it also guarantees an income of Rs 12,000 per month to these families.

""What happens if one family has an income of only Rs 4,000 and another Rs 8,000 per month? Will the former then receive Rs 8,000 and the latter Rs 4,000 per month? If so, why should anyone with income below 12,000 do any work at all since their incomes will be Rs 12,000 regardless of what they earn?"" he asked.

Interpreted this way, ""there is a serious incentive problem with the scheme"", Panagariya asserted.

""If the scheme is meant to transfer flat Rs 6,000 per month to identified families regardless of the family's earned income, you cannot deliver Rs 12,000 per month to families earning less than Rs 6,000,"" he asserted.

The programme, as announced by the Congress, guarantees Rs 12,000 per month in income to the poor, which is Rs 144,000 per year, he said, explaining the fairness issue.

Add to it all other in-kind transfers: subsidised food, NREGA wages, free house, free toilet, free education and Rs 500,000 free health insurance coverage. The gross sum will be close to Rs 200,000 per year, Panagariya observed.

""Now think of someone not covered by the scheme and earning Rs 300,000 per year. This family will have to pay Rs 2,500 in taxes (currently covered by a tax credit but in principle taxable). How fair is this to those working?

""Moreover, taxpayers are all in urban areas and dole recipients all in rural areas. Will this not open a serious rural-urban schism? No one questions helping the destitute on the margin but when help is given to give all comforts of life free, those paying for those comforts will become intensely unhappy,"" he said.

Then there is the question of fiscal challenge, he said.

If Rs 12,000 per month per household is to be guaranteed to bottom 20 per cent of the population, even the average Rs 6,000 per family will be insufficient, he argued.

""But let us set that problem aside. Can we scrape Rs 3.6 trillion per year (calculated at Rs 6,000 per family for 50 million households)? There is no chance.

""It is 13 per cent of the proposed total central government expenditure in budget 2019-20,"" Panagariya said.

Anit Mukherjee, a policy fellow at the Center for Global Development where he works on issues of governance, public finance and service delivery in developing countries, said how to identify the target beneficiaries and how to absorb the fiscal impact are two major problems.

The amount is substantial, more than the current government has proposed (Rs 6,000 per year), and to a general definition of the poorest of the poor (and not just farmers), he said.

""However, it is about half of what a similar scheme in Kenya through a US-based charity GiveDirectly provides to over 20,000 adults purely on a universal basic income criteria,"" Mukherjee said, adding the results of the scheme are still awaited, so there is no firm global evidence on whether Universal Basic Income works or not at the scale which the programme in India would operate on.

According to Mukherjee, to address the problem of fiscal impact, there has to be ""cutbacks"" in other subsidies, principally food, fuel, electricity and fertiliser.

""Some transfers to the poorest of the poor, such as MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) and social pensions, would probably have to be absorbed into NYAY,"" Mukherjee told PTI.

Schemes such as Public Distribution System and MGNREGA are constitutionally mandated and it would be hard to remove them altogether, he said.

The Centre, which has struggled to contain the fiscal deficit, will have to foot the entire bill so the fiscal concern is justified, Mukherjee said.

Donald Trump: Google CEO Sundar Pichai committed to US, not Chinese military 

","
WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump said he met with the chief executive of Alphabet Inc's Google on Wednesday and discussed ""political fairness"" and the company's business in China.


""He stated strongly that he is totally committed to the US Military, not the Chinese Military,"" Trump said on Twitter of his meeting with Google CEO Sundar Pichai.

""Also discussed political fairness and various things that @Google can do for our Country. Meeting ended very well!,"" Trump said.


Just met with @SundarPichai, President of @Google, who is obviously doing quite well. He stated strongly that he is… https://t.co/MkEveSi6u7— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1553715535000

Google also issued a statement on the meeting.

""We were pleased to have productive conversations with the President about investing in the future of the American workforce, the growth of emerging technologies and our ongoing commitment to working with the US government,"" a Google spokesperson said in the statement.

""We are not working with the Chinese military. We are working with the US government, including the Department of Defense, in many areas including cybersecurity, recruiting and healthcare,"" the spokesperson said.

The top US general, marine general Joseph Dunford, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, told a Senate committee hearing earlier this month that the Chinese military was benefiting from the work Google was doing in China.

The US military said that Dunford met Pichai on Wednesday at the Pentagon at Google's request.

""General Dunford shared his concerns about US tech firms working in China and the potential impact on the United States' ability to maintain a competitive military advantage due to intellectual property being indirectly shared with the Chinese military,"" Colonel Patrick Ryder, a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said.

Pichai has said Google has invested in China for years and plans to continue to do so.

In a tweet last week, Trump accused social media platforms Facebook, Google's YouTube and Twitter of favoring his Democratic opponents over him and his fellow Republicans and said he would look into the issue.

Consumer loans beat overall credit - Times of India

","
MUMBAI: Unsecured personal loans, which are availed for consumption, have emerged the fastest growing segment in bank lending. 


According to borrower data analysed by TransUnion CIBIL, loans outstanding under credit cards, personal and consumer durable loans grew 31.3% year-on-year as on December 2018. This is more than double the 15% year-on-year growth recorded by overall bank credit.

The TU CIBIL Industry Insights Report (IIR) shows consumer credit market continued to expand over the past year thanks to strong growth in these unsecured segments. As against this the secured lending category — loans against property (LAP), auto and housing — experienced more moderate total balance growth. But even these segments grew at a robust rate of 21.8%, 17.4% and 17.1%, respectively.




Also, while default rates remained relatively stable across most major consumer lending categories, loans against property have seen a 53-basis point rise in serious delinquencies. Auto loans have been an exception with serious delinquency rates dropping 116 basis points to 2.8%. Serious delinquency rates are measured as the percentage of loans that are overdue for 90 or more days.

“Consumer credit continues to be a key driver for the Indian economy. Although GDP growth has decelerated in recent quarters, the rate of overall consumer lending growth in India is still significantly higher than for most other major economies in the world,” said Yogendra Singh, vice-president of data science and analytics for TransUnion CIBIL. One reason for the sharp growth in this unsecured segment is the improved ability of lenders to provide loans for the non-salaried new-to-credit segment by using fresh data sources and analytical tools. Banks have been using technology to analyse their customers account histories to extend loans. This is despite the fact that year-on-year GDP growth for India slowed to 6.6% in the quarter ended December 2018, compared to 7% in the July-September quarter and over 7% growth in the first half of 2018.

In terms of the number of accounts, all major consumer lending products saw double-digit percentage growth. Credit cards — the product with the largest number of accounts — grew 31.4% in total balance and 28.6% in the number of accounts. As of December 2018, more than 2.5 crore Indians had credit cards, an increase of 50% compared to the end of 2016 (immediately after demonetisation). Although the actual number of credit cards is over four crores, TU CIBIL has data to identify the number of unique individuals who hold a credit card.

“The significant expansion in consumer credit card access over the past two years may be in part attributable to the experience of the demonetisation event. Consumers see the importance and value of credit cards in facilitating spending as well as in providing access to liquidity and borrowing power,” said Singh.

TU CIBIL data shows that while loan inquiries have jumped 40% year-on-year in the quarter ended December, approval rates have not quite kept pace. The ratio of approval to inquiries is dropping and according to TU CIBIL, this is an indication of non-prime, higher-risk consumers entering the credit marketplace.

ICICI Bank launches digital home loan products up to Rs 1 cr for instant disbursal - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Private sector ICICI Bank on Thursday said it has launched two instant home loan products for up to Rs 1 crore.

 The facility helps the customers get the top up amount disbursed immediately in their account as compared to the industry practice of approving and disbursing a top up home loan in a few working days, the bank said. 

 ""As a result of our continued endeavour, we have the largest mortgage portfolio among private sector banks in the country with the lowest delinquency levels. Instant home loan facilities are extensions of this same endeavour. These facilities will help new home buyers as well as the existing customers,"" ICICI Bank executive director Anup Bagchi said. 

 The bank's outreach to tier II, III cities and micro-markets and focus on affordable housing is the key to rapid growth for its mortgage portfolio, he said. 

 ""In line with this strategy, we have expanded our mortgage business to over 500 tier II, III, IV markets this fiscal. With this expansion, we are now offering home loans at over 1,500 locations, the maximum among private sector banks,"" he said. 

 The bank's disbursement in these markets is growing at a CAGR of over 20 per cent, as compared to the industry average of 12 per cent. 

 The bank has identified 500 high-potential branches for mortgages, where-in a dedicated area has been created for mortgages along with new technology-led workflow to ensure better experience for customers, the release said. 

 ""ICICI Bank has the largest mortgage portfolio among private sector banks in the country. In 2016, we crossed the milestone of cumulatively disbursing mortgage loans of Rs 1 trillion. We are on course of touching a mortgage portfolio of Rs 2 trillion by March 2020,"" Bagchi said.

SC refuses to stay merger of Vijaya, Dena banks with Bank of Baroda - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Clearing decks for the scheduled merger of three public sector lenders - Vijaya Bank, Dena Bank and Bank of Baroda - the Supreme Court on Thursday refused to stay the amalgamation.


The top court dismissed the applications filed by several bank officers' associations for staying the merger, effective April 1.

The proposed amalgamation will make Bank of Baroda, which will merge the other two lenders with itself, the second largest public sector bank after State Bank of India in place of Punjab National Bank.

A bench of Justices R F Nariman and Vineet Sharan said, ""all interlocutory applications seeking stay are dismissed"".

At the outset, senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for bank officers associations, said that there were several flaws in the decision taken for merger of three banks as there was no effective consultation or concurrence with the Reserve Bank of India on the issue.

He said that even the board of directors of the banks were not adequately constituted to take a decision of merger like this.

""The board of directors should have been informed and given time to contemplate on the proposed merger of the banks but every thing happened on January 2,"" Divan said.

He said that the board of directors passed a resolution on January 2, cabinet approved the decision on the same date and even the gazette notification was issued on the same day.

The bench asked Divan how is he affected by the decision of merger of the banks.

He said that employees will suffer due to the merger as there will be an aspect of redundancy.

Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Bank of Baroda, said the merger was done within the statutory framework and all requisite procedure was duly followed.

""All the banks in question are public sector banks and as far as employees are concerned, under the scheme their terms and conditions of employment will remain the same. They are not affected at all. It was a policy decision that two weaker banks join one stronger bank,"" he said.

He said that as far as effective consultation with RBI is concerned, the process had started way back in September 17, 2018.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Union of India also opposed the plea of bank officers and said it was a purely an economic policy decision taken by the government for which detailed consultation has taken place.

He said three committees were constituted, Parliament was informed and the RBI was consulted after which in principle consent was given.

""Everything was done in a purely transparent manner and this is an economic policy decision taken by the government,"" he said.

The bench then said it is rejecting all the applications seeking immediate stay of the decision to merge the three banks.

Income tax: Direct tax collection falls short, CBDT raises alarm 

","
NEW DELHI: The CBDT has rung alarm bells and has asked the Income Tax (I-T) department to go for a major assault as the direct tax collection target remains short of about 15 per cent, with the financial year closing less than a week away.


On March 26, CBDT member (revenue) Neena Kumar shot off a letter to all the regional chiefs of the department stating that the tax collection figures have ""been reviewed and it is seen that as against the budget collection target of Rs 12,00,000 crore, only 85.1 per cent of the target at Rs 10,21,251 crore has been collected as on March 23.""

The officer, who is responsible to supervise I-T department's tax collection work across the country, underlined the areas that are sluggish vis-a-vis direct tax collections obtained from personal, corporate and advance tax categories.

""The minor head-wise analysis indicates worsening trend of negative growth in regular collections at -6.9 per cent as against -5.2 per cent in the last week. This is an alarming situation which needs immediate attention,"" Kumar wrote in the letter.

The officer expressed CBDT's disappointment at this situation and has asked the supervisory tax officials to pull up their socks and ensure no stone remains unturned to achieve the target.

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) frames policy for the I-T department and is also its controlling authority that functions from the North Block in the finance ministry.

""You are aware that regular assessment tax is bench-mark of performance as it is based upon quality of demand raised which can further be converted into actual collections,"" Kumar wrote in the letter.

""Board (the CBDT) has discussed strategies through various communications with you (senior officials) and it was expected that by this time your strategies would have succeeded resulting into improved collections. However, the figures of collection give a different account,"" she added.

She asked the department to take ""all possible actions urgently, especially with respect to recovery of arrear and current demand, so as to achieve the targets for collection.""

The CBDT has been worried over the direct tax collection work for quite some time and board chairman P C Mody had recently held a video-conference with the top brass of the department across the country and discussed strategies to boost the collection figures to be achieved by the end of the 2018-19 fiscal on March 31.

Both Mody and Kumar are undertaking daily updates on the issue. They are monitoring advance tax and arrear collections, enforcement action to check tax evasion and subsequent surrender of undisclosed income, a senior official said.

Cognizant president may steer L&T’s IT services business - Times of India

","
BENGALURU: Rajeev Mehta, who will step down as the president of Cognizant on April 1, may join L&T at a time when the latter has mounted an unsolicited bid to acquire Mindtree, people directly aware of the matter said.


Mehta will serve as an adviser to Cognizant's new CEO Brian Humphries till May 1, announced earlier as part of his exit plan.

Mehta is expected to help the $18-billion construction and engineering conglomerate to chart aggressive growth for IT services units - L&T Infotech, L&T Technology Services, and Mindtree, if the acquisition bid is successful. He is likely to spearhead the combined operations when L&T merges these units eventually, sources said.

Mehta emerged as the top contender after L&T undertook an exhaustive leadership mapping exercise to identify the new face to steer the business, they added. Calls and emails to Mehta remained unanswered at the time of going to press. Queries to L&T didn't elicit any response.

A two-decade-old Cognizant veteran, Mehta was a key figure in former CEO Francisco D'souza's core team which scripted the 2020 strategy. He joined the company when it was barely $25 million and was part of the long growth rally to $16 billion last year. Mehta was appointed as president of the company in 2016 replacing his predecessor Gordon Coburn who resigned from the firm after Cognizant disclosed violations to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

Phil Fersht, CEO of US-based HFS Research, said, ""Mehta has lived the whole Cognizant growth story over many years and was widely tipped to take over from D'Souza when he stepped aside. He was known internally as ""Frank's right-hand bulldog"" -- a toughie, an enforcer, a doer. He has proven operational leadership capability (essential for what LTI/Mindtree needs) and is used tackling the shift from $2 billion to over $10 billion,"" he said.

Ten days ago, L&T acquired the largest shareholder V G Siddhartha's 20% stake in Mindtree, pitting the four founders in a public fight against the former. L&T has also placed an order with brokers to pick up another 15% of the company shares from the market. In addition, it has announced an open offer for 31% of shares. If successful, the cumulative deal for 66% stake will cost L&T nearly Rs 11,000 crore, or $1.6 billion.

Mehta, who nursed CEO ambitions, was given a substantial increase in his compensation last year, and it was expected he would stay in the company. He got a cash bonus of $1.3 million and restricted stock units of $9 million. In 2017, Mehta's target cash incentive was $535,000 which was double of what its former CEO Francisco D'Souza received that year.

Fersht argued that Mehta would be a terrific choice to lead the merged entity because of his terrific connections, experience and the dedication to ram those two together. ""With the mid-caps like Mphasis, Virtusa, Genpact all doing well, there is clear evidence that this merger could be successful, but needs very strong leadership. Raj Mehta must be geared up for a situation he is tailor-made for!"" he added.

Trai will not recommend reduction in 5G prices - Times of India

","
BARCELONA: Telecom regulator Trai said on Wednesday that it will not recommend any reduction in 5G spectrum reserve prices even as Bharti Airtel said it will not participate in the auction of the airwaves due to excessive pricing.


“There is no question at all of making any changes to the prices, which we have recommended for 5G spectrum,” Trai chairman R S Sharma said on the sidelines of the Mobile World Congress.

Sharma said prices suggested by Trai are “reasonable” and have been worked upon after detailed assessment. “We stand by our recommendation. However, a final decision will be taken by the government.” He added that the department of telecom has not asked any major questions around spectrum pricing.

Sharma’s statement comes a day after Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Mittal said reserve prices of 5G spectrum are too high.“We can (participate), but we will not at these prices because it makes no sense. The telecom department can keep trying — they had two failed auctions and do they want to have five more failed auctions? … India will get into 5G, but the only thing that will stand in the way is right pricing for spectrum. The government can decide if they want to do it in one go or three times,” Mittal said.

The government intends to auction 5G spectrum over the next one year as India is willing to join the high-speed bandwagon in line with the global trend. The government is keen to begin trials for 5G applications very soon and is looking at participation of telecom and network equipment companies.

Jet Airways News: Planes grounded, Jet Airways sends expat pilots on leave without pay 

","
NEW DELHI: 

  Jet Airways
 + has started sending its pilots - most likely only the expats - on furloughs, or leaves without pay. Expat pilots cost nearly twice as much as their Indian counterparts as they have to be given accommodation and flight tickets to their home country every few weeks. Since Jet is now operating 35 of its once-upon-a-time fleet of 124 planes, the lender-led management has begun cutting this extra cost. The airline is trying to take this number to 75 by April 26, still leaving it pilot surplus.


Sources say only expat pilots are being sent on furlough. Despite repeated attempts, Jet did not comment on how many expats it has and if the offer is being made to them only. 



With just one-fourth of operational fleet, Jet suspends services to 13 international routes till end-AprilJet Airways has suspended operations on 13 more international routes till end-April and grounded seven more planes due to non-payment of rentals, taking the number of such aircraft to 54. The airline has also reduced frequencies on seven other overseas routes, mostly from Delhi and Mumbai. From 600 daily flights operations reduced to one-fourth.


""Due to the reduced network and fleet plan, the company's pilot requirements on your fleet have reduced and your services will not be required… as an interim arrangement, we are offering furlough to pilots. Accordingly, we hereby offer you furlough of your employment with effect from April 01, 2019 till further notice,"" a letter issued to an expat pilot of Boeing 737 on Thursday said.

""Please consider this letter as notice to furlough your employment with us. We will periodically assess pilot requirements and advise you accordingly,"" it adds. During the furlough, pilots will not not receive salary, any other monetary benefit, accommodation and medical insurance. 

""However, you will continue to be eligible for free passages as per the prevailing staff travel policy of the company. You shall maintain recency / validity of your licenses / medical during the period of furlough.

In the last two months, Jet has seen several of its pilots leave. They along with aircraft engineers and senior management are awaiting payment of last three to four months' salaries. 

Expat pilots have always been a touchy issue in almost all Indian carriers. Last August when Jet had proposed 15 per cent pay cut for pilots, the airline had even then issued ad to hire expats. When Indian pilots questioned the move of cutting their salaries yet continuing to hire expats, the then management had said salary of expat pilots would also be deducted. The salary deduction move did not happen and the airline later was not in a position to pay salaries to the level of employees with big pay packages.

Income tax, statutory claims part of ‘operational debt’ - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has held that statutory dues, including income tax and value-added tax or goods and services tax, come within the purview of “operational creditors”.


“...(the) income tax department of the central government and the sales tax department(s) of the state governments and local authority, who are entitled for dues arising out of the existing law are operational creditors within the meaning of section 5(20) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code,” an NCLAT bench comprising Justices S J Mukhopadhaya and Bansi Lal Bhat said, while deciding on a bunch of cases filed by tax authorities.

The order will impact several insolvency resolution cases that are in the pipeline as well as those in which orders have been passed, experts said.




In four cases — Synergies Dooray Automotive, Raj Oil Mills, Phoenix Erectors and Parte Casters — tax authorities had argued that they were either not party to the resolution process or that their demand was not adequately heard by the resolution professional.

They argued that operational debt also included debt arising under any law payable to the central and state governments.

Senior lawyers Rajiv Ranjan and Sugam Seth, who had been asked to assist the appellate tribunal, concluded that tax is not related to the supply of goods or services rendered by a company and they cannot be treated as operational debt.

The counsel appearing for the companies took the plea that income tax cannot be in the nature of operational debt as it referred to the claim in respect of goods or services, including employment or a debt in respect of repayment of dues of the central, state government or local authorities.

The bench, however, took the view that operational debt in normal course meant debt arising during the operations of the company. “If the company is operational and remains a going concern, only in such case the statutory liability, such as payment of income tax, VAT, etc, will arise. As income tax, VAT and other statutory dues arising out of the existing law arises when the company is operational, we hold such statutory dues has direct nexus with operations of the company,” the bench said in its order.

Govt again extends telecom equipment, mobile phone testing deadline to Aug 1 - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: The government has once again extended the deadline for mandatory testing and certification of mobile phones and telecom equipment to August 1, 2019. Department of telecom (DoT) had in 2012 for the first time fixed April 1, 2013 as the deadline for mandatory testing and certification of telecom equipment (MCTE), and has deferred it many times since then. 


""It has now been decided that certification of all telecom equipment under MCTE shall be mandatory with effect from August 1, 2019,"" Telecom Engineering Centre (TEC), technical arm of DoT, said in a notice dated March 12. 

According to a previous order in September 2018, TEC said some of the equipment like wi-fi access points, satellite equipment, telephone instruments, etc, can be sold only after testing and obtaining certificate from authorised agencies from January 1, 2019. 

Moreover, April 1, 2019 was fixed as the deadline for certification of mobile base stations, routers, internet of things devices and other network gears. 

To allay fears of cyber espionage, DoT in 2011 had amended telecom licence rules which made telecom operators install only those equipment in their network that are safe and certified by international reputed agencies until March 31, 2013. 

When contacted, industry body Mobile Association said the extension of deadline is a favourable step towards ensuring a smooth transition to MCTE regime by mobile phones manufacturers. 

""I believe that the extension will give enough time to the mobile brands to address the challenges regarding adequate testing infrastructure, completion of the TEC portal, and finalisation of the criteria for series of guidelines of mobile phones, among others,"" Bhawna Kumari, president, Mobile Association said.

ITC eyes top position in deo market - Times of India

","
KOLKATA: FMCG-to-hotel-to-tobacco major ITC is eyeing the top slot in the growing deodorant market following its second major disruption in the segment in the form of unveiling a two-in-one pocket perfume spray, first in its category under Engage ON brand. Currently, Engage is India's No. 2 deodorant brand, according to Nielsen data, with a hold of nearly 11% of India's deo market while Fogg is the market leader with 18% market share in a Rs 3,047-crore segment nationally.

ITC made its first major disruption in the deo market with the introduction of a pocket deo in 2017, which was later followed by others like Park Avenue, Wild Stone and Axe.

Sameer Satpathy, chief executive (personal care), ITC, pointed out that Engage is growing at 17-18% for the last three years, including the deodorant market, and the pocket perfume segment is its major growth driver. Pocket perfume segment is now 4% of the total deo market going by the value. The ITC top brass is hopeful that Engage would take over Fogg gradually.

Owing to a healthy CAGR for the last three years, the deodorant market has also grown from Rs 2,365 crore just two years back to the current level of over Rs 3,000 crore. Engage, too, has crossed the Rs 300-crore mark, and is eyeing the Rs 500-crore mark in next two-three years.

Infosys buys 75% in ABN Amro arm for Rs 1,000 crore - Times of India

","
BENGALURU: Infosys is buying a 75% stake in Stater, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ABN Amro Bank, for $143 million (about Rs 1,000 crore). ABN Amro will continue to hold the remaining 25%.


The acquisition will strengthen Infosys's capabilities in mortgage administration services in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. Stater is a market leader in the Benelux region, operating across the mortgage and consumer lending value chain with deep capabilities in digital origination, servicing and collection, a company release said.

Stater, founded in 1997, services 1.7 million mortgage and insurance loans for approximately 50 clients in the Netherlands and Belgium. Infosys will drive the digital transformation road map of Stater with accelerators such as dynamic workflow, API layers, robotic process automation, and analytics.

The current management team of Stater will continue to steer the company.

Infosys president Mohit Joshi said, ""This transaction strengthens our approach to offer clients digital platforms and industry focused solutions. We are excited to welcome Stater's talented team to the Infosys family, thereby enhancing our presence in Europe.""

Christian Bornfeld, member of the executive board of ABN Amro, said that while mortgages are a key product for ABN Amro, providing administrative mortgage services is not a core activity. ""That's why we are very pleased with Infosys as Stater's new majority shareholder,"" he said.

Mortgage services is a focus area for large financial majors given the importance of the asset on a bank's balance sheet.

The specialised knowledge and experience of Stater in the mortgage services market can potentially create differentiated solutions for the market, the release said.

GST cut: Government expects realtors to pare prices - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: The GST Council, which is scheduled to meet on March 19, may restrict the use of tax credits accumulated by builders and allow a concessional rate for up to 10% of commercial property, such as shops, in residential complexes, expecting developers to pare prices.


At the last meeting, the council — comprising state and Union finance ministers — had agreed to reduce the levy on under-construction residential projects to 5% without input tax credit (ITC) from the current 12%, with credit for taxes paid on inputs such as paints, steel, cement and sanitary ware. For affordable housing projects, the rate will be slashed to 1% without ITC from 8% with tax credit. But the modalities for the rate reduction, which will be effective, are yet to be worked out.

Sources indicated that the officials were in favour of accepting the recommendations of a ministerial panel, which had suggested that intermediate tax on development rights, lease premium, floor space index and similar items should be exempted for houses where a completion certificate has not been issued.

Given the government assessment that builders were misusing the benefit of tax credit and did not pass on the gains, the Centre is looking at the option of putting high claims under the lens. Sources told TOI that the issues have been discussed at the official level but a final call will be taken by the ministers.

The government is keen to ensure that builders do not raise prices, citing the withdrawal of input tax credit, and should actually reduce the rate. “Our analysis has shown that they were not passing on the benefits to consumers, although they were showing very high tax credit and paying a very low amount of tax in cash,” said an official.

According to the government’s calculation, prices should actually come down. For a Rs 40-lakh apartment, the builder should have factored in the impact of input tax credit, reducing the value to around Rs 38 lakh and then added the margin of, say, around 10%. As a result, the builder should have charged 12% GST on around Rs 42 lakh, translating into a tax of around Rs 5 lakh, which would have put the overall cost at Rs 47 lakh. Without ITC, with a 10% margin, the cost will now come to around Rs 44 lakh. A 5% tax will mean that the same apartment will cost Rs 46.2 lakh, according to the government’s back-of-the-envelope calculations.

'Nyay' scheme poses 'fiscal challenge' to India's economy: Arvind Panagariya - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: Former Niti Aayog vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya has said the implementation of the Congress Party's ambitious 'Nyay' scheme not only poses a ""fiscal challenge"" to India's economy but also has a ""serious incentive problem"".


Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said that its minimum income guarantee scheme, 'Nyuntam Aay Yojana' (Nyay) assures up to Rs 72,000 a year or Rs 6,000 a month income to 20 per cent of India's poorest families if the party is voted back to power in the Lok Sabha elections next month.



We will 'remonetise' what Modi 'demonetised', says Rahul GandhiRahul Gandhi on Thursday said the 'Nyay' scheme will remonetise what PM Modi demonetised and asserted that his party's anti-poverty programme has thrown the BJP into total disarray. The Congress president said the 'Nyay' scheme has the twin objectives of giving money to the 20% poorest families and remonetising the economy ""damaged"" by demonetisation.


Panagariya, who served as the first vice-chairman of Niti Aayog for two years from 2015 to 2017, told PTI that 'Nyay' is difficult to implement and unlikely to achieve its intended objective.

""It raises three major questions - the incentive compatibility issue, the fairness issue and fiscal challenge,"" Panagariya, an eminent Indian-American economist, said.

But Gandhi said the 'Nyay' scheme has the twin objectives of giving money to the 20 per cent poorest families and remonetising the economy damaged by the demonetisation in 2016.

Its aim is two-fold. First is to guarantee a minimum income to the bottom 20 per cent families. The second is to remonetise the economy that has been demonetised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gandhi told PTI.

Senior Congress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram on Wednesday said 'enough' economists and experts had been consulted and they broadly agreed that India has the capacity to implement the scheme.

Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has said the implementation of the scheme is possible, Chidambaram said.

""Our calculation shows that it will not cross 2 per cent of the GDP, it will be 1.8 per cent of the GDP at any given point of time,"" he said.

Commenting on the scheme, Panagariya said the transfer is meant to be Rs 6,000 per month per family to 50 million families and at the same time, it also guarantees an income of Rs 12,000 per month to these families.

""What happens if one family has an income of only Rs 4,000 and another Rs 8,000 per month? Will the former then receive Rs 8,000 and the latter Rs 4,000 per month? If so, why should anyone with income below 12,000 do any work at all since their incomes will be Rs 12,000 regardless of what they earn?"" he asked.

Interpreted this way, ""there is a serious incentive problem with the scheme"", Panagariya asserted.

""If the scheme is meant to transfer flat Rs 6,000 per month to identified families regardless of the family's earned income, you cannot deliver Rs 12,000 per month to families earning less than Rs 6,000,"" he asserted.

The programme, as announced by the Congress, guarantees Rs 12,000 per month in income to the poor, which is Rs 144,000 per year, he said, explaining the fairness issue.

Add to it all other in-kind transfers: subsidised food, NREGA wages, free house, free toilet, free education and Rs 500,000 free health insurance coverage. The gross sum will be close to Rs 200,000 per year, Panagariya observed.

""Now think of someone not covered by the scheme and earning Rs 300,000 per year. This family will have to pay Rs 2,500 in taxes (currently covered by a tax credit but in principle taxable). How fair is this to those working?

""Moreover, taxpayers are all in urban areas and dole recipients all in rural areas. Will this not open a serious rural-urban schism? No one questions helping the destitute on the margin but when help is given to give all comforts of life free, those paying for those comforts will become intensely unhappy,"" he said.

Then there is the question of fiscal challenge, he said.

If Rs 12,000 per month per household is to be guaranteed to bottom 20 per cent of the population, even the average Rs 6,000 per family will be insufficient, he argued.

""But let us set that problem aside. Can we scrape Rs 3.6 trillion per year (calculated at Rs 6,000 per family for 50 million households)? There is no chance.

""It is 13 per cent of the proposed total central government expenditure in budget 2019-20,"" Panagariya said.

Anit Mukherjee, a policy fellow at the Center for Global Development where he works on issues of governance, public finance and service delivery in developing countries, said how to identify the target beneficiaries and how to absorb the fiscal impact are two major problems.

The amount is substantial, more than the current government has proposed (Rs 6,000 per year), and to a general definition of the poorest of the poor (and not just farmers), he said.

""However, it is about half of what a similar scheme in Kenya through a US-based charity GiveDirectly provides to over 20,000 adults purely on a universal basic income criteria,"" Mukherjee said, adding the results of the scheme are still awaited, so there is no firm global evidence on whether Universal Basic Income works or not at the scale which the programme in India would operate on.

According to Mukherjee, to address the problem of fiscal impact, there has to be ""cutbacks"" in other subsidies, principally food, fuel, electricity and fertiliser.

""Some transfers to the poorest of the poor, such as MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) and social pensions, would probably have to be absorbed into NYAY,"" Mukherjee told PTI.

Schemes such as Public Distribution System and MGNREGA are constitutionally mandated and it would be hard to remove them altogether, he said.

The Centre, which has struggled to contain the fiscal deficit, will have to foot the entire bill so the fiscal concern is justified, Mukherjee said.

Ethiopian Airlines chief questions Boeing 737 Max training requirements - Times of India

","
ADDIS ABABA: The warning and training requirements set for the now-grounded 737 Max aircraft may not have been enough following the Ethiopian plane crash that killed 157 people, the chief of Ethiopian Airlines said Saturday.


After the Lion Air crash off Indonesia in October, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing ``came up with contents that we incorporated in our working manuals and also briefed all our pilots. But today we believe that might not have been enough,'' Tewolde Gebremariam told The Associated Press in an interview in Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa.




Ethiopian crash captain untrained on 737 MAX simulator: Source


Ethiopian Airlines insists the carrier's pilots went through all the extra training required by Boeing and the FAA to fly the 737 Max 8 jet. The March 10 crash killed people from 35 countries.

Gebremariam said earlier in the week that the training was meant to help crews shift from an older model of the 737 to the Max 8, which entered airline service in 2017. In a statement, he said pilots were also made aware of an emergency directive issued by the FAA after the Lion Air crash, which killed 189 people.




Boeing to offer safety feature as standard in 737 MAX software upgradeThe development comes as the manufacturer struggles to cope with the fallout from both the Indonesia crash and another in Ethiopia this month, which have cast a spotlight on the safety certification process and shaken confidence in a plane that is crucial to its future plans.


Ethiopian Airlines has said there is a ``clear similarity'' between the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes, citing preliminary information from the flight data recorder.

Although the causes of the crashes haven't been determined, investigators in the Lion Air disaster have focused on an automated system designed to use information from two sensors to help prevent a dangerous aerodynamic stall.

It is not known whether the same flight-control system played a role in the crash of the Ethiopian Airlines jet shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa, but regulators say both planes had similar erratic flight paths, an important part of their decision to ground the roughly 370 Max planes around the world.

Both planes flew with erratic altitude changes that could indicate the pilots struggled to control the aircraft. Shortly after their takeoffs, both crews tried to return to the airports but crashed.

The New York Times reported on Wednesday that the pilots of the doomed Ethiopian plane never trained in a simulator for the Max. Gebremariam, the Ethiopian Airlines CEO, said Saturday that ``it wouldn't have made any difference'' as the 737 Max simulator isn't designed to imitate problems in the new jet's flight-control software.

He still didn't say whether the pilots had trained on the simulator.

Boeing's planned software update for the Max must ``address the problem 100 percent before we return the aircraft to air,'' he said, noting that the airline hasn't made a decision on whether or not to cancel orders for Max jets.

Ethiopian Airlines is widely seen as Africa's best-managed airline.

The carrier had been using five of the Max planes and was awaiting delivery of 25 more.

Money Mysteries: How your mindset impacts investments - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Is there any intrinsic difference between an investor who generally makes good investments and one who mostly makes bad ones? If one goes by what the financial services industry appears to believes in, then the answer is there is no inherent difference. And, someone like me, who interacts with a large number of investors, finds it easy to believe that there is something inherent about the qualities that make some of us better investors. Those who repeatedly run after questionable investments somehow appear to do so because of some characteristic of their personality.


However, I once read an article that made me think hard about whether this was really true. This article, which was on the fascinating Brain Pickings blog (http://bit.ly/2TJhfX3) summed up some pretty interesting research into the psychology of learning. The article is called ‘Fixed vs. Growth: The Two Basic Mindsets That Shape Our Lives’. What attracted me to it first was the phrase ‘Fixed vs. Growth’ but as it turned out, the words did not mean what they do in finance and investing.

What they meant was a ‘fixed mindset’ vs a ‘growth mindset’. The researchers saw a fixed mindset was more commonly found in people who have an inherent ability or intelligence. Such people try something and succeed without much effort. Then they try something harder and fail, and often regress, limiting themselves to whatever they first succeeded at.

On the other hand, those who don’t have an inherent ability actually progress. They try something, but succeed only with hard work and dedication. This gives them a valuable life lessonthat effort and hard work brings success. If they work at something, mount a persistent effort, then success will come. They learn that if something is difficult, it doesn’t mean it can’t be done. It just means it will take higher persistence and sustained effort.

So it should be obvious that this has profound implications on how we invest. Many of us try non-optimal, low-return investments and find comfort in predictability. Then, we try some equity or equity mutual funds and find that the going is not so easy. One has to put in a bit of work, choose carefully and even then, success doesn’t come automatically. So when the setbacks hit, different investors react in different ways. Those with a growth mindset conclude that they didn’t do something right and set forth to fix it. Those with a fixed mindset decide that equity doesn’t work, and retreat to the counterproductive world of fixed deposits and similar products.

In a way, the fixed and growth mindsets have a parallel with the words’ meaning in investments. There are investors with an equity mindset and there are those with a fixed income mindset and members of either group are psychologically incapable of defecting to the other. If you get a debt person to invest in equity, the uncertainty and the stress of the market’s gyrations makes them run away sooner or later. Equity people consider all debt investments to be a waste of time or money.

We’re all happy when the going is good. However, in stressful times like the present it’s useful to carefully examine one’s responses to the challenge of investing.

RCom, Reliance Jio terminate pact for sale of telecom assets - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Nearly 15 months after Anil Ambani agreed to sell assets of Reliance Communications to a telecom firm run by elder brother Mukesh, the two groups on Monday called off the deal citing delays in approval from the government and lenders.


""The said transactions have become incapable of being consummated in accordance with the terms thereof, on account of various factors and developments since the execution of the said agreements nearly 15 months ago...,"" RCom said in a regulatory filing.

The reasons included non-receipt of consents / objections from RCom's over 40 foreign and Indian lenders in relation to the proposed transactions even after 15 months and over 45 meetings, as well as the non receipt of permissions and approvals from the telecom department.

Other factors behind termination of agreements included the decision taken by the RCom Board on February 1, 2019 to seek fast track resolution of its overall debt through the National Company Law Tribunal, and order passed by the NCLAT on February 4, 2019 restraining the sale, transfer or alienation of any movable or immovable property of RCOM, RTL and RITL (RCom Group companies).

""The statements of the lenders, as recorded in the order dated 15th March 2019 of...NCLAT, that it is not possible for them to sell the specified assets, and therefore, the NCLT process for debt resolution should be reinstated,"" RCom said citing other causes behind the decision.

""RCOM Group is committed to a comprehensive resolution of their overall debt, with transparency, certainty and finality, through the NCLT process,"" it added.

In December 2017, RCom had signed a blockbuster deal with Reliance Jio for the sale of wireless spectrum, tower, fibre and media convergence nodes assets - the proceeds of which were to be used to pare its staggering Rs 46,000 crore debt.

Earlier today, Reliance Communications paid Rs 458.77 crore to Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson as per SC directive - clearing outstanding dues and fending-off a jail term for its chairman Anil Ambani.

Mumbai-Delhi remains world's third busiest domestic route in 2018: OAG - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Mumbai-Delhi remained the world’s third busiest domestic route in 2018 with 45,188 flights operated by six airlines during the year, averaging almost 124 flights daily. UK-based air consultancy firm OAG on Tuesday released the “busiest routes 2019” report which featured Bangalore-Delhi as the 19th busiest domestic route with 28,716 flights by seven airlines between the two cities last year.


Mumbai-Delhi was the third domestic busiest route in 2017 too but that year saw 47,462 flights between the financial and political capitals of India. This number went down 4.8% in 2018 as demand for domestic air travel in India is slowly cooling down while India still remains one of the world’s largest growing aviation markets. Indian airlines have been cancelling flights in past few months due to various reasons like financial crunch and pilot shortage.

Meanwhile, no city pair to or from India featured on the list of top 20 international routes in 2018 also. The 296-km-short Kuala Lumpur-Singapore sector was the world’s busiest international route in 2019 with 30,187 flights last year, followed by Hong Kong-Taipei at number two with 28,447 flights. The iconic New York (JFK)-London Heathrow route was 13th busiest with 14,195 flights between the two last year.

The top 20 domestic routes had two Indian sectors. The busiest domestic route in the world, by a large margin, is Jeju (Korea) - Seoul Gimpo with nearly 80,000 annual flights by seven carriers. The second busiest domestic route is Melbourne - Sydney with around 148 flights each day.

“There are 15 domestic routes in the world which have more flights operating each year than any international route anywhere. The top 20 busiest domestic routes are located in 13 different countries in every continent except Europe. Each of Australia, China, India, Japan and US have two of the busiest domestic routes,” OAG said.

45,188 flights between Mumbai and Delhi in 2018:

IndiGo: 26% flights
Jet: 23%
AI: 18%
Vistara: 15%
GoAir: 12%
SpiceJet: 6

Cosmos Bank heist motivated from N Korea: UNSC report - Times of India

","
PUNE: A report of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) panel has said that the online heist on city-based Cosmos Bank’s switches, that cost the lender more than Rs 94 crore, was “motivated” from North Korea.


This is the first report by any agency confirming the suspicion that the attacks could have links to North Korea. The panel submitted the report to the council for further action by the member states.

Citing cyber experts, TOI had first reported on August 15 last year that the North Korean hacker group, Lazarus, could be behind the Cosmos Bank attacks when there were near simultaneous withdrawals over two days and had cost the bank Rs 94.42 crore.

“Not only were the actors able to compromise the SWIFT network in the Cosmos case to transfer the funds to other accounts, but they simultaneously compromised internal bank processes to bypass transaction verification procedures and order worldwide transfers to almost 30 countries, where funds were physically withdrawn by individuals in more than 10,000 separate transactions over a weekend,” the report read. The observations are part of the wider report by the UN panel of experts established pursuant to resolutions to impose sanctions on North Korea for its nuclear programme.

The panel observed that North Korea’s cyber hackers had resorted to multiple cyber frauds to mitigate the sanctions imposed on the nation. “Cyberattacks by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to illegally force the transfer of funds have become an important tool in the evasion of sanctions and have grown in sophistication and scale since 2016,” according to the report.

On August 11 and 13 last year, a series of malware infections attacked Cosmos Bank’s ATM switches (an interface to the bank’s core banking solution [CBS] or another core financial system, and connectivity to regional, national or international networks) and then made adjustments to target account balances to enable withdrawals.

Bank depositors oppose repo as benchmark for savings accounts - Times of India

","
MUMBAI: Bank depositors have urged RBI governor Shaktikanta Das to reconsider allowing banks to use the repo rate as a benchmark for interest on savings account. The association has also asked Das to direct banks to remove the restriction on digital transactions in basic bank accounts which includes Jan Dhan Yojana accounts.


The All India Bank Depositors Association met with Das on March 26 as part of the governor’s pre-policy engagement with customers. They pointed out that banks were violating RBI’s directive to automatically offer senior citizen rates when the customer turns 60. “It is legitimate and fair that senior citizens, who have been deprived of the benefit of higher interest rate from the time it was due to them, must be compensated retrospectively for the monetary losses they might have suffered,” the association said.

In the meeting, Sunil Bhandare, president of the association, said that they were evaluating the impact of SBI’s move to link high-value deposits to the RBI’s repo rate. “The softening repo rate trend invariably creates a major challenge for bank depositors. They have to bear a brunt of the repo rate reduction given a virtual pari passu (ranking equally) reduction in deposit rates,” Bhandare said in his presentation to the governor. He pointed out that a drop in the consumer price index does not signify fall in actual prices of goods and services the depositor buys from the market. However, his nominal income from bank deposits drops immediately.

As an alternative, the association has suggested that banks could use the average of the CPI inflation rate for the past 12 months or the weighted average of inter-bank call money rate plus Treasury Bills rate plus five-year bond yield.

Banks have opened over 35 crore basic bank accounts under the Jan Dhan Yojana scheme. These accounts have zero balance requirements and banks are now allowed to impose charges for services. Banks have also been asked to permit five minimum withdrawals a month. Banks, however, have interpreted this to mean five debits into account and many are freezing the accounts after five transactions while some are converting the accounts into regular accounts with minimum balance requirements and other charges.

“After four debits in a month from a Basic Savings Bank Deposit Account (BSBDA), the customer would no longer be able to make online purchases, transfer money through BHIM or use the RuPay debit card at merchant locations for his day-to-day purchases. Inhibiting the financially included citizens to transact digitally through their bank accounts surely hurts the progress of the country’s digital payments drive. The very nature of the RBI regulation has forced banks to limit the BSBDA usage,” Bhandare said.

GST council’s move on residential realty gives relief to developers - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: GST council’s decision on Tuesday to give option to choose tax regime to charge GST for ongoing projects has brought some reprieve to developers’ concern on the loss of Input Tax Credit (ITC) in the new regime, market players and experts said.


“By making the new tax rates optional for residential projects under construction, the 34th GST Council has effectively addressed apprehensions as well as potential disputes on various computational and transitional issues, such as loss of input credits, pricing and others that were bound to arise on account of the change,” Mekhla Anand, Partner, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas said.

Providing such an option to the developers would be beneficial to those who had already factored in the entire input credits of the project, while arriving at the sale price and in many cases these benefits may already have been passed on to customers, said Pratik Jain, Partner & Leader, Indirect Tax, PwC India.

Under the earlier regime, GST at the rate of 12% had to be charged at the discounted sale price arrived at after factoring the entire ITC that was available to the developer. If the regime is changed midway, the developers are forced to charge GST at the rate of 5% on the reduced price. But, the developers cannot avail the ITC as ITC has been discontinued.

For example, if a developer wants to sell a flat for Rs 1 crore on construction linked payment and he is supposed to get Rs 6 lakh as ITC from the government, he can sell the flat for Rs 94 lakh. In this system, he will charge 12% GST on every payment made by the customer for his purchase price of Rs 94 lakh. Therefore a customer will have to pay Rs 1,05,28,000 including GST.

As the developer has committed to sell the flat at Rs 94 lakh, and tax regime changed, the developer will not able to recover his Rs 6 lakh unless he revises the price with the customer.

But there are situations where revised prices including GST under the new system would be beneficial to the prices under the old tax regime for customers, particularly where the pre GST prices of house are upward of around Rs 10,000 per sq ft.

Therefore, Jain said, “Industry will have to work out, which option works best and come up with the revised price structure quickly. It is important to undertake changes in IT systems, documentation and processes at earliest considering the April 1, 2019 cut off date.’’ Jain said that timely engagement with the customers would also be important, as they would expect overall reduction in prices.

CREDAI national president Jaxay Shah said, “The real estate industry is particularly happy that the government has taken all precautions to ensure a smooth and easy transition to the new regime of rates, and allowed the option to follow the existing rates for ongoing projects.’’

Delhivery: Softbank’s $413 mn round to push Delhivery valuation to $1.5 billion 

","
BENGALURU: Japanese telecom and internet major Softbank has led a $413 million financing round in e-commerce focused logistics platform Delhivery, valuing the eight-year-old company at $1.5 billion. The transaction would make Gurgaon-based startup the latest member of the Unicorn club, the term used for private companies valued over $1 billion, which has doubled to over 20 startups since the end of 2017 (graphic). 


Delhivery, which has raised a total of about $675 million including this round, and will be followed by a secondary share sale where early backers like Multiples and Nexus Venture Partners will sell some shares worth about $150 million, according to two sources briefed on the matter. 

Delhivery did not revert to the query on RPS investment and secondary share sale. Delhivery said it will increase its reach from 15,000 to 20,000 pin codes in the next 12 months, aggressively grow e-commerce market share investment, and also target new enterprise customers beyond e-commerce and SMEs. The company delivers more than 500,000 parcels a day. 

“We will be scaling up our newer warehousing and freight services through large investments in infrastructure and technology and global partnerships,” said CEO Sahil Barua, who co-founded the company in May 2011 with Mohit Tandon, Bhavesh Manglani, Suraj Saharan and Kapil Bharati.

Delhivery had earlier this year acquired India business of Dubai-based Aramex, and is also seeking alliances with logistics players in Middle East, China, and USA. It is also pushing for an expansion into the freight business as it has started building a fleet of trucks so it will now directly take on Rivigo.

For the financial year ending March 2018, Delhivery’s losses increased by 8% to Rs 684 crore while revenues moved up 42% to Rs 1,070 crore. 

India’s Unicorn Club Expands, B2B Cos Enter

The new set of Unicorns which have come in over the last 15 months are from more diverse sectors like financial technology, education, and logistics as compared to the previous batch, which was mostly from online commerce and advertising based companies.

An interesting trend here is the emergence of business-to-business (B2B) companies like payments players Billdesk and Pine Labs, and Udaan, which helps connect shopkeepers directly with manufacturers, as compared to primarily direct consumer-facing companies which became Unicorns earlier. 

“Now the Unicorns are also getting wider among sectors, as companies like Udaan and Delhivery are purely business-to-business (B2B),” said Anand Lunia, founding partner at early stage investment firm India Quotient. 

“Some of the recent companies have grown really fast and the multiplication of revenues is also really quick. The time to reach a Unicorn status has shortened.”

Motorists get relief again, third party insurance cover won’t be hiked this year - Times of India

","
BENGALURU: The insurance regulator said on Thursday there would be no increase in motor third-party insurance premiums for bikes, cars and commercial vehicles for the financial year 2020. The regulator had been hiking motor third-party (TP) insurance premiums nearly every April by 10-40% over the last decade; except for last year's unprecedented cut of 10-20% for bikes, cars and taxis.


The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India has this year chosen not to make any revisions to TP motor insurance. The regulator fixes rates only for third party motor cover and allows insurers to set their own rates for owned-damage and personal accident. This year, the market was expecting a hike of 20-30% in insurance rates, so the regulator's decision comes as a welcome move for consumers, said sources.


No increase
IRDAI on Thursday informed insurers that the premium rates for motor third party set on April 1, 2018 will remain same until further notice. In other words, insurers shall continue to charge the rates currently being charged until further orders.

Current rates for small mopeds, small capacity scooters and two-wheelers with engine capacity below 75cc will remain at Rs 427.

For scooters and motorbikes with engine capacity between 75-150 cc premium would be at Rs 720 and for high-powered bikes Rs 985.

For small car owners it will remain at Rs 1,850, for sedans (1,000-1,500 cc) and SUVs (above 1,500 cc) it is at Rs 2,863 and Rs 7,890 respectively. Rates for auto rickshaws and e-rickshaws are at Rs 2,595 and Rs 1,685 respectively.

Taxi owners of smaller commercial cars will continue to pay Rs 5,437 annually, while entry-level sedans might have to shell out Rs 7,147 a year.

Vijay Mallya's appeal moves forward as Nirav Modi set for UK court hearing - Times of India

","
LONDON: The stage is set for a busy period of Indian extradition-related activity in the UK courts as liquor baron Vijay Mallya's high court appeal moves forward for a judge's verdict on paperwork and fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi returns to Westminster Magistrates' Court here for a second bail hearing on Friday.


""All the papers have been received and are now awaiting allocation to a single judge who will decide, on the basis of those papers, if permission is given to go to a full hearing,"" said a spokesperson for the UK judiciary, in reference to Mallya's application seeking an appeal against his extradition ordered by the magistrates' court and then signed off by UK home secretary Sajid Javid last month.

While there is no set timescale for the judge to pronounce a decision on whether Mallya will be granted an appeal in the UK High Court, a decision is likely within the next few weeks.

The 62-year-old former Kingfisher Airlines boss, wanted in India on alleged fraud and money laundering charges amounting to about Rs 9,000 crore, took to social media yet again to claim unfair treatment in the context of struggling Indian airlines Jet Airways being thrown a lifeline by public sector banks.



Take my money, save Jet Airways, Vijay Mallya tweets againIn a series of tweets posted in the early hours, Mallya said, ""Happy to see that PSU Banks have bailed out Jet Airways saving jobs, connectivity and enterprise. Only wish the same was done for Kingfisher."" Goyal along with his wife Anita stepped down on Monday following which lenders agreed to pump in Rs 1,500 crore to bail out the financially troubled airline.


In her ruling at the end of his extradition trial in December last year, Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot had concluded that Mallya has a case to answer in the Indian courts over substantial ""misrepresentations"" of his financial dealings.

""There is clear evidence of dispersal and misapplication of the loan funds and I find a prima facie case that Dr Mallya was involved in a conspiracy to launder money,"" she noted.



Why Jet Airways flies when Kingfisher Airlines couldn'tReacting to the take over of management control (and equity) of the troubled Jet Airways by banks led by the State Bank of India, Mallya said, ""...only wish the same was done for Kingfisher"". 


Now, the same judge is expected to preside over the next major Indian extradition trial to come before the Westminster Magistrates' Court, that of diamantaire Nirav Modi – wanted for alleged ""high value and sophisticated"" fraud and money laundering amounting to $2 billion.

""He is expected to be produced before the court for a second bail application hearing on March 29,"" a court official said.

Meanwhile, the 48-year-old has been lodged in HMP Wandsworth prison in south-west London since last Wednesday, when a judge had declined his request for bail on the grounds that he posed a flight risk.



PNB scam: Nirav Modi arrested in London, remanded in custody till March 29The United Kingdom had responded to a Red Corner Notice issued by the agency against Nirav Modi last year, they added. The RCN was issued in June 2018 on a request from the agency to the Interpol.


Describing him as the ""opposite of a flight risk"" during the first bail application hearing last week, Nirav Modi's defence team had offered 500,000 pounds as security and also submitted to any stringent conditions that may be imposed upon their client.

It remains to be seen how they would further bolster that offer in order to convince the judge to grant bail during the second hearing, following which the case will proceed to a series of case management hearings and setting of a trial date.

Nirav Modi was arrested by the Scotland Yard officers from a bank in central London as he attempted to open a new bank account on March 19.

During his first court appearance a day after, it emerged that the diamantaire accused of defrauding India's state-owned Punjab National Bank (PNB) via fraudulent Letters of Undertaking (LoUs) had been in possession of multiple passports, since revoked by the Indian authorities.

While one passport is now in possession of the Metropolitan Police, a second expired passport is lying with the UK Home Office and a third with the UK's Driving and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) for a driver's licence.

Besides the passports, Nirav Modi also possesses multiple residency cards, some of them expired, but covering countries such as the UAE, Singapore and Hong Kong.

His defence team tried to establish his very ""visible"" and ""lawful"" residence at his luxury Centre Point apartment in London's West End, paying his local council tax and also using a National Insurance number, allocated to legal UK residents for purposes of work.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), arguing on behalf of the Indian authorities, had challenged all claims to counter the first bail plea and pointed out that Nirav Modi had ""deliberately evaded justice"" and not returned to India despite a series of criminal summons issued by Indian courts.

The CPS will now be joined by a joint Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) team that has arrived from India to assist with Nirav Modi's extradition case.

Why Jet Airways flies when Kingfisher Airlines couldn't - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Embattled liquor baron Vijay Mallya lashed out at public sector banks for ""double standards"" for their intervention to bailout Jet Airways while the same lenders made his Kingfisher airlines ""fail ruthlessly"". Reacting to the take over of management control (and equity) of the troubled Jet Airways by banks led by the State Bank of India, Mallya said, ""...only wish the same was done for Kingfisher"". Union minister Nitin Gadkari had, in December, said that terming Mallya, who had a four-decade-long track record of timely debt servicing, a thief for 'a one-time loan default' was 'unfair'.




Take my money, save Jet Airways, Vijay Mallya tweets againIn a series of tweets posted in the early hours, Mallya said, ""Happy to see that PSU Banks have bailed out Jet Airways saving jobs, connectivity and enterprise. Only wish the same was done for Kingfisher."" Goyal along with his wife Anita stepped down on Monday following which lenders agreed to pump in Rs 1,500 crore to bail out the financially troubled airline.


The similarities
Months before Kingfisher Airlines stopped flying (in October 2012), the carrier was in a similar situation as Jet Airways today. It struggled to pay salaries to its 7,000 employees (as Jet has done since September last year), defaulted on payments to lenders (Jet defaulted on its payments in December) and was forced to cancel flights (due to pilot protests compared to unpaid lease in the case of Jet). When Kingfisher was grounded it had an outstanding debt of Rs 7,000 crore (the figure is over Rs 9,000 crore now). Jet owes about Rs 10,000 crore to lenders. 

The factors that led to the mess were similar, as well — high fuel prices, weak rupee and cut-throat competition. Plus, like Kingfisher's acquisition of Deccan Airways accelerated its downfall, a major cause of Jet's financial troubles is believed to be the expensive acquisition of Air Sahara in 2006 (which some say was a move to thwart Kingfisher from acquiring it). While keeping Jet airborne is about the market (it controls a sixth of the domestic aviation market) and (16,000) jobs, the same was true for Kingfisher too (in 2007 the airline had almost the same market share as Jet and Jetlite combined). Banks were criticised for not seeing signs of trouble at Kingfisher on time. While the banks seem more proactive this time, Jet has been in the red (its net worth has been negative too) for over five years.




The difference
For one, banks have learnt some lessons after having burnt their fingers with Kingfisher. While they are still looking to salvage the debt extended to Jet by picking up a stake in the company (as they did in Kingfisher’s case), they have realised that it makes sense to sell a running company (even if it means pumping in some more money) instead of letting it go bankrupt.

Two, Reserve Bank of India's strict norms don't give banks much leeway to delay things. The central bank has scrapped all restructuring plans (a big reason for the delay in debt resolutions and recovery) except that driven by the bankruptcy law and empowered banks to treat payments miss, even by a day, as default. Three, there were no elections when Kingfisher went belly up in 2012 (unlike now) and job creation wasn't as big an issue as it is now.


The challenge
The UPA government had salvaged Satyam after it went into a tailspin following its founder's stunning revelation of fraud. Now, it is the NDA government's turn to preside over another vital corporate rescue.

RBI: WhatsApp yet to comply with data localisation norms 

","
BENGALURU: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said that the popular messaging platform WhatsApp is not in compliance with the central bank’s data localisation norms in India. RBI’s comments come as response in an affidavit, reviewed by TOI, filed with the SC on Wednesday after the apex court made the central bank a party to a writ petition in January.


This is the first time the central bank has made an official statement on WhatsApp’s payments business and compliance with data localisation. WhatsApp, which is owned by social networking giant Facebook, has now been operating its payments business — WhatsApp Pay — in beta-mode for a year, restricted to one million users. The RBI also said it is exploring regulatory actions to expedite compliance of data localisation. However, it is being cautious to make sure a consumer’s transaction experience is not disrupted by any such measures. 




Centre for Accountability and Systemic Change, an NGO, had filed the petition challenging WhatsApp’s compliance standards and absence of a local grievance officer here. “As informed by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) on November 16, 2018 and February 5, 2019, WhatsApp is non-compliant with the RBI circular (on data localisation),” RBI’s response in the affidavit said. WhatsApp entered payments in India through Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which is run by NPCI. The original petition also challenged the Menlo Park-based company of non-payment of local taxes. 

The RBI has maintained that payments service providers and third-party payments app should follow its April 6 circular on data localisation, which mandates storage of key payments data only in India. The operative word here is — only — which payments companies had requested the RBI to omit. The RBI did not entertain the request.

Sources said WhatsApp’s newly appointed head for India — Abhijit Bose — recently met NPCI MD & CEO Dilip Asbe in Mumbai to discuss the regulatory concerns and hoping to accelerate the process of obtaining a final nod to roll out its payments service full-scale. For WhatsApp, India is its largest market with over 200 million monthly active users here. An email sent to WhatsApp India spokesperson did not elicit a response at the time of going to press. 

In October last year, WhatsApp said it built a system that stores payments-related data locally in India. NPCI, however, thought it was not enough since WhatsApp was merely mirroring or copying the payments data in India. It keeps the same in its overseas servers as well. 

Issues related to fake news and the government’s request to allow message traceability have only added to WhatsApp’s woes in India, ahead of general elections. TOI had previously reported how these non-payments issues have also emerged as a roadblock for the company’s payments operations here. To be sure, foreign payments players like Mastercard, Visa, Google and others are still in the process of complying with RBI’s data localisation guidelines. According to industry sources, these companies have given various timelines within 2019 by when they expect to be fully compliant with the norms.

Cognizant president may steer L&T’s IT services business - Times of India

","
BENGALURU: Rajeev Mehta, who will step down as the president of Cognizant on April 1, may join L&T at a time when the latter has mounted an unsolicited bid to acquire Mindtree, people directly aware of the matter said.


Mehta will serve as an adviser to Cognizant's new CEO Brian Humphries till May 1, announced earlier as part of his exit plan.

Mehta is expected to help the $18-billion construction and engineering conglomerate to chart aggressive growth for IT services units - L&T Infotech, L&T Technology Services, and Mindtree, if the acquisition bid is successful. He is likely to spearhead the combined operations when L&T merges these units eventually, sources said.

Mehta emerged as the top contender after L&T undertook an exhaustive leadership mapping exercise to identify the new face to steer the business, they added. Calls and emails to Mehta remained unanswered at the time of going to press. Queries to L&T didn't elicit any response.

A two-decade-old Cognizant veteran, Mehta was a key figure in former CEO Francisco D'souza's core team which scripted the 2020 strategy. He joined the company when it was barely $25 million and was part of the long growth rally to $16 billion last year. Mehta was appointed as president of the company in 2016 replacing his predecessor Gordon Coburn who resigned from the firm after Cognizant disclosed violations to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

Phil Fersht, CEO of US-based HFS Research, said, ""Mehta has lived the whole Cognizant growth story over many years and was widely tipped to take over from D'Souza when he stepped aside. He was known internally as ""Frank's right-hand bulldog"" -- a toughie, an enforcer, a doer. He has proven operational leadership capability (essential for what LTI/Mindtree needs) and is used tackling the shift from $2 billion to over $10 billion,"" he said.

Ten days ago, L&T acquired the largest shareholder V G Siddhartha's 20% stake in Mindtree, pitting the four founders in a public fight against the former. L&T has also placed an order with brokers to pick up another 15% of the company shares from the market. In addition, it has announced an open offer for 31% of shares. If successful, the cumulative deal for 66% stake will cost L&T nearly Rs 11,000 crore, or $1.6 billion.

Mehta, who nursed CEO ambitions, was given a substantial increase in his compensation last year, and it was expected he would stay in the company. He got a cash bonus of $1.3 million and restricted stock units of $9 million. In 2017, Mehta's target cash incentive was $535,000 which was double of what its former CEO Francisco D'Souza received that year.

Fersht argued that Mehta would be a terrific choice to lead the merged entity because of his terrific connections, experience and the dedication to ram those two together. ""With the mid-caps like Mphasis, Virtusa, Genpact all doing well, there is clear evidence that this merger could be successful, but needs very strong leadership. Raj Mehta must be geared up for a situation he is tailor-made for!"" he added.

US oil exports: From Texas to the world: Flood of US oil exports is coming - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Oil trader Paul Vega is at the vanguard of shale’s next revolution.


Driving his pick-up truck through the heartland of the Permian basin -- the vast tract of west Texas scrub where one of history’s greatest oil booms means miles-long traffic jams -- Vega says there’s more crude being pumped than America’s refineries can absorb. Today, the primary task of trading houses like his is getting the stuff overseas.

""We buy it, we truck it, we put it on a pipeline, and there it goes to the port -- and from there to the world,"" said Vega, who heads the office of global commodities trader Trafigura Group in Midland, the region’s oil industry hub.

What started as an American phenomenon is now being felt around the world as US oil exports surge to levels unthinkable only a few years ago. The flow of crude will keep growing over the next few years with huge consequences for the oil industry, global politics and even whole economies. Opec, for example, will face challenges keeping oil prices high, while Washington has a new, and potent, diplomatic weapon.




American oil exports stepped up a gear last year, jumping more than 70 per cent to just over 2 million barrels a day, according to government data. ""That could double again over the next few years as people continue to invest in shale,"" said Russell Hardy, the head of top oil trader Vitol Group. Over the past four weeks, US oil exports have averaged more than 3 million barrels a day --- more than what Middle East petro-state Kuwait sells.

""This is the new American energy era,"" US energy secretary Rick Perry told an industry conference in Houston earlier this month.

Oil traders and shale executives believe US crude exports are set reach 5 million barrels a day by late 2020, up another 70 per cent from current levels. If the US hits that target, America will be exporting, on a gross basis, more crude than every country in Opec except Saudi Arabia. (On a net basis, the US remains, just, a net importer, but that’s likely to change in the next few months.)

“The second wave of the US shale revolution is coming,” said Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency. “This will shake up international oil and gas trade flows, with profound implications for geopolitics.”

The political impact is already being felt. The Trump administration has been able to impose aggressive sanctions on oil exports from Iran and Venezuela knowing the flow of crude from Texas will keep on rising. The economic impact on the US is also evident: in dollar terms, the country’s petroleum trade deficit fell to its lowest in 20 years in 2018.

The US is already a big exporter of refined products such as gasoline and diesel. When combined with rising crude exports, the IEA forecasts American petroleum exports will reach roughly 9 million barrels a day within five years, up from just 1 million in 2012. In the process, the US will become the world’s second-largest exporter of crude and refined products by 2024, overtaking Russia and nearly topping Saudi Arabia.

Until now, the surge in US oil production from the Permian and other shale basins like the Bakken in North Dakota was absorbed at home, feeding refineries in the US Gulf of Mexico coast. Now, US refiners are finding it increasingly hard to process more of the kind of light crude pumped in the Permian as their plants were built to process denser heavy crude -- the type pumped in Venezuela and the Middle East.

""The United States is probably darn close to being able to process as much light crude as it can,"" Thomas J Nimbley, the head of US oil refiner PBF Energy Inc, told investors.

As a result, shale executives are traveling the world to seek new customers. Gary Heminger, the head of Marathon Petroleum Corp, for example, was recently in Singapore and South Korea looking for buyers for shale crude.

""All the incremental Permian production needs to be exported,"" said Raoul LeBlanc at consultant IHS Markit Ltd and a former head of strategy at Anadarko Petroleum Corp. ""The Permian needs to find refineries willing to take US light sweet crude as a base-load, most likely in Asia.""

Despite a tight oil market due to American sanctions on Venezuela and Iran mixed with Opec production cuts, finding new buyers isn’t as easy as it sounds. The crude from the Permian is light, yielding lots of naphtha -- used in the petrochemical industry -- and gasoline, but comparatively little diesel. And most refineries want to produce diesel.

Until now, US shale producers and oil traders had been selling most of their crude on spot transactions -- one at a time. As a result, American oil exports saw wildly different destinations from month to month, from Spain to Thailand to Brazil.

A few stable markets are starting to emerge. Oil refineries in Canada, Italy, the UK, and South Korea are becoming regular buyers. And little by little, oil traders are securing long-term deals with overseas refineries, known as term contracts.

Yet, the rapid rise in oil exports is challenging. Not even Saudi Arabia in the 1960s and 1970s saw exports grow so quickly.

""The US export market needs to transition from infancy to adulthood far more rapidly than any major exporter ever has,"" said Roger Diwan, another oil analyst at IHS Markit.

Key for US oil exports is China, mired in a trade war with Washington. Until this year, Chinese refiners were buying large chunks of American shale exports. But the flows all but dried up in August. If US oil exports are going to increase at the pace that executives and traders anticipate, the shale industry needs the White House to strike a trade deal with the Chinese.

""If the China demand pull fails to materialise, for political reasons, quality mismatch or otherwise, US exports will likely have to muscle their way into the global refining system, likely via price discounts,"" Diwan said.

US shale crude is already selling at a big discount to Brent, the international oil benchmark. West Texas Intermediate sells nearly $10 under Brent. And some of the lighter grades from the Permian, including a new stream called West Texas Light, are seeing even wider discounts.

Finding buyers for the light Permian crude isn’t the only obstacle. Pipelines and ports have become the biggest bottleneck in US oil exports, with traders engineering logistically complex chains combining railways, trucks, pipelines, barges, and ship-to-ship transfers to get crude out of the country. Several ventures are aiming to build new facilities to allow exports via supertankers, which need deepwater ports.

The export surge started in late 2015 when Washington lifted a 40-year ban on most oil sales overseas, imposed in the aftermath the 1973-74 oil embargo by the Arab members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

Although the Permian isn’t growing as fast as last year, oil traders and executives still anticipate that America will add another million barrels a day this year to its production, with the bulk coming in the second half. The current slowdown, which some executives jokingly call a ""fracking holiday,"" is the direct result of shareholder demands for higher returns and less growth, and lower oil prices in late 2018 and early 2019. But the Permian is likely to re-accelerate in the second half of this year when new pipelines open.

If the forecast proves correct, US crude production will surpass 13 million barrels a day by December, up from 11.8 million barrels a day at the end of last year and well above the previous all-time high set in 1970.

""It’s going to be less than if people were able to spend unconstrained, but there’s going to be growth, lots of it,"" said Osmar Abib, chairman of global energy at Credit Suisse Group AG.

China to import more from US to balance bilateral trade: Top official - Times of India

","
BEIJING: Ahead of the crucial talks next month to finalise the texts of trade deal with the US to end the trade war, a top Chinese official said on Sunday that China will import more goods from the US to balance bilateral trade, a key demand of President Donald Trump.



Trump is demanding China to reduce the $ 375 billion trade deficit and protection of intellectual property rights (IPR), technology transfer and more access to American goods to Chinese markets.

He has already increased the tariffs on over $ 250 billion Chinese exports to the US and threatened to extend tariffs on $ 200 billion Chinese imports to 25 per cent.

Trump held back his threat to impose additional tariffs on the rest of Chinese imports as both sides stepped up talks to finalise the text of the deal.

The White House said recently that talks between Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He, China's main trade negotiator and the US trade representative Robert Lighthize and treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin will be held on April in Washington.

Ahead of the talks, Vice-Premier and Politburo Standing Committee member Han Zheng told the China Development Forum in Beijing on Sunday that China will work to boost imports and achieve a more even balance of trade with the US.

Han told a gathering of foreign business representatives and former government officials from the US and other countries that his government was committed to levelling the playing field.

“We do not aim to …(increase the) trade surplus and sincerely want to increase imports to achieve trade balance,” Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.

He said that China would improve market access, including shortening the “negative list” of industries in which foreign investment is limited or prohibited, and ban the practice of forcing foreign firms to transfer proprietary technology to joint venture partners.

“As the next step, we will continue to shorten the negative list for foreign investors and allow sole proprietorship of foreign businesses in more sectors,” he said.

China would also speed up the opening up of more sectors, including telecommunications, education and health care, he said.

“We will continue to strengthen intellectual property protection, prohibit forced technology transfers, and build a penalty and compensation system (for infringement cases),"" he said.

Beijing is reported to have promised to buy larger quantities of US agricultural and energy products to help achieve that goal.

The trade gap for goods bought and sold by the US and China in 2018 rose 11.6 per cent from the previous year to a record $ 419 billion, the Post report said.

China recently passed a new foreign investment law which for the first time provide an opportunity to foreign firms from June 1 to invest in China without joint ventures with protection to technology.

Chinese officials say the new law with a negative list provides level playing field treating foreign firms on par with that of the domestic companies.

Rajat Gupta: Finance people 'will eat you for lunch,' Rajat Gupta's wife warned - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Rajat Gupta, feted business guru turned convicted felon, says he should have trusted his wife’s instincts about tangling with the world of high finance.


“These aren’t our people,” the former McKinsey & Co managing director and former Goldman Sachs Group Inc director says his wife would tell him. “You’re too trusting and you think everyone will be nice to you. Financial people are different than consultants. They’ll eat you for lunch!”

The incident is part of Gupta’s memoir, ‘Mind Without Fear,’ titled after a poem by revered Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, whose work also lends a name to Gupta’s firstborn, Geetanjali.

In it, Gupta returns time and again to the theme of misplaced trust. He rues his unpreparedness for the winner-takes-all realm of finance that he says was so different from the sheltered life he led at McKinsey. Through this lens, Gupta explains how one of the most influential men in corporate America found himself convicted for insider trading in the throes of the financial crisis.

The memoir comes just months after a federal appeals court declined to throw out Gupta’s 2012 conviction. Gupta had argued that US prosecutors failed to prove he got a personal benefit for passing tips to his friend, billionaire hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam. A federal jury had found Gupta guilty of passing tips about Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs and the bank’s financial results. While Gupta has already served his prison term, a ruling in his favor would have cleared his record.


‘Fellow immigrant’

In his book as well as an interview in New Delhi in February, Gupta said he didn’t share anything of consequence with Rajaratnam. He alleges that the main prosecutor, Preet Bharara -- a “fellow immigrant” -- worked the press to darken public opinion and the jury against Gupta as a cover for Bharara’s failure to punish bankers in the wake of the global financial crisis.

“If going after the big banking executives was too difficult, he needed another way to appease the public’s desire for convictions. Hedge funds were an ideal target,” Gupta says in the book. “They carried the aura of Wall Street greed and excess, but were not enmeshed in the global financial markets or in politics the way the big banks were. They also lacked the political muscle to defend themselves.”

In a quirk of fate, Bharara also published his memoir March 19, in which he scoffs at accusations that his office targeted South Asians. Bharara denies that federal prosecutors were too scared or motivated by political considerations to go after individual bank officials, and says they were held back by lack of evidence of criminal intent, according to published excerpts.


No memory

One finance executive who comes in for criticism in Gupta’s memoir is Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman’s former chief executive officer who testified for the prosecution over three days. During the trial, while Blankfein couldn’t recall specific details about meetings or calls with Goldman directors in 2007-2008, he reportedly testified that it was his practice to estimate off the estimate and also to inform the board about the bank’s expected profit-and-loss statements. The judge ruled that custom and practice was admissible evidence and these proved to be critical points in respect to the charges against Gupta, according to Gupta’s book. At the time, Gupta’s lawyer had assailed Blankfein, calling him “ a man with no memory of anything” and “less than candid.”

“Privately, I wondered what had incentivized Blankfein to dedicate so much time to the case,” Gupta writes. “I knew him well enough to know he doesn’t give favors freely -- there had to be something in it for him or for the bank. In the years to come, as Goldman remained seemingly untouchable amidst the ongoing recriminations following the financial crisis, my questions only persisted.”

During the interview with Bloomberg, Gupta said there were early signs that Blankfein possibly resented Gupta’s “global network that was in many ways far greater” than his.

He pointed to a Goldman meeting in Moscow, where Blankfein tried to introduce a Russian minister to the board, only for Blankfein to be ignored in favor of Gupta, who’d known the minister for a decade.


‘Zero-sum-game’

Distrust about the financial sector is a thread that runs through Gupta’s memoir and parallel to his belief in the ideals of McKinsey, which he joined at 24 and retired from three-and-a-half decades later. “The financial industry is a little of a zero-sum game, and they are much more skilled at trying to figure out how to protect their own interest,” Gupta said. “At McKinsey, you learn about client interest and you don’t think ‘I have to protect myself.’”

Gupta concedes his wife is probably right in saying he romanticizes the firm. But, this was the scene of some of his greatest victories -- where the orphaned son of a socialist freedom fighter from India rose through the ranks to become, he says, “the first Indian to ever lead a global company of McKinsey’s stature.”

He had achieved the quintessential American dream, until it unraveled.

Now a slightly stooped 70-year-old, Gupta said he hadn’t believed that he could be taken advantage of. Still charming, soft-spoken and impeccably dressed in a sharp navy suit and striped tie, he said his years at McKinsey sheltered him because the firm’s stature ensured you never got ordered around even while rubbing shoulders with CEOs.


Corporate honchos

Even now, it’s apparent he feels most comfortable around corporate honchos. Identified explicitly as “friend” in the book are Mukesh Ambani, Asia’s richest man, billionaires Sunil Mittal and Shiv Nadar, and new age guru, Deepak Chopra, who would often meditate with Gupta. Reading between the lines, though, is the apparent desertion by the American corporate establishment.

This includes McKinsey, which stripped Gupta of the use of the company’s email address, a privilege normally afforded to former managing directors. His business card today carries the Seventh Avenue, New York, address of The Chatterjee Group, run by an Indian-origin family friend.

Gupta maintains a small office there, he said, where he focuses on his charity projects. He’s the chairman of the Indian offshoot of the US-based Wheels Global Foundation, created by alumni of India’s top technology schools. It received a $2 million donation last year from Chirag Patel, the founder of Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC.

Gupta’s also forming a not-for-profit focused on reducing recidivism and another called Rise and Step with a Haitian journalist he met in prison that will help the families of prisoners. During his time in jail he interviewed about 40 prisoners about their cases and, armed with “this big spreadsheet,” is considering writing for The Marshall Project about the US criminal justice system.

Gupta took a personal hit of about $26 million from fines and restitution because of his conviction, he said, but the greatest costs were the lost opportunities. He regrets not testifying at his trial -- a decision he attributes to his lawyers, wife, and a chat with Frank Quattrone, a powerful American technology investment banker, who was prosecuted for obstruction of justice and later cleared by an appeals court.

“In the end, the prosecutor told a good story -- not a true story, but a believable one, given the climate of the time,” Gupta said. “And in my silence, I did not offer a better story.”

In ‘Mind Without Fear,’ he’s finally able to write his own.

Iran looks to Chabahar port to beat US sanctions - Times of India

","
CHABAHAR: With the web of US sanctions tightening, Iran faces a host of challenges as it looks to an isolated port in the country's far southeast to maintain the flow of goods.


The port in Chabahar, only about 100 kilometres (62 miles) from the Pakistan border and located on the Indian Ocean, is Iran's largest outside the Gulf.

It is also the only Iranian port with exemptions from unilateral economic sanctions reimposed by the United States in 2018.

That is due mainly to the pivotal role of the port, and a planned railway line, in breaking landlocked Afghanistan's dependence on Pakistan for trade with the world, especially India.

Afghan trade as well as plans for a trading route by rail between central Asia and the Indian Ocean called the North-South Corridor are the main reasons the Islamic republic has invested one billion dollars in Chabahar's Shahid Beheshti port, official sources say.

""We will keep on developing this port... our rail network, road network and airport are all being developed, so that we can implement the North-South Corridor,"" roads and urban development minister Mohammad Eslami told AFP while visiting Chabahar for a development conference.

More than 200 hectares (almost 500 acres) of land have been reclaimed from the sea for the project and over 17.5 million cubic metres (618 million cubic feet) dredged, creating a 16.5 metre (54-foot) draught.

But more than a year since the new installations became operational in December 2017, business has yet to pick up.

The ships that officials say have docked in the past year have only loaded and unloaded 2.1 million tonnes of cargo, a far cry from the port's annual capacity of 8.5 million tonnes.

Only 20 ships have docked at the new section of the port and most of its three kilometres of waterfront remains unutilised, with new machinery and neatly lined-up cranes standing idle.

But authorities remain upbeat about the prospects for growth.

Hossein Shahdadi of the provincial ports and maritime authority said that in the first 11 months of the past Iranian year, which started on March 21, 2018, ""there has been a 56 per cent increase in cargo handled at the port compared with the previous year"".

""We've also had a 25 per cent rise in the number of ships calling at the port"" on the Gulf of Oman, he said.

Arun Kumar Gupta, managing director of India Ports Global Limited which has a 10 year concession at the new port, played down the startup issues.

""Any port will have a gestation period, there will be lulls but we are very sure that traffic will pick up,"" Gupta told AFP.

The Indian company began work in December and has so far handled only an average of 60,000 tonnes of cargo per month.

But Gupta is counting on the port's proximity to India and Afghanistan to attract business.

Chabahar's location, however, carries its own risks as it lies in the volatile Sistan Baluchistan province where militant jihadists operate.

In December, a suicide attack on the local police headquarters killed two policemen.

During an investment conference in February, security was tight with many roads cut off and hundreds of armed security personnel deployed to protect delegates.

Apart from security concerns, US sanctions banning financial transactions with Iran make it ever harder to pay or receive payments.

Some like Afsaneh Rabiani, who runs a freight forwarding company, see Chabahar as an opportunity for ""those willing to take the risk"".

""I've been researching Chabahar for the past year and a half, and the infrastructure is now in place to do serious work here,"" she said.

As for the sanctions, Iran's roads minister said the challenge was nothing new.

""We were born with sanctions. Ever since the (1979 Islamic) revolution, we have been under sanctions and we are working on how to counter them,"" Eslami said, as he oversaw the unloading of a first shipment of Afghan goods lined up to be re-exported from Chabahar.

Will you lose your job? What are the signs and how to prevent it - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: One of the biggest uncertainties in an employee’s life is triggered by two small words: “You’re fired!” With a family to support, bills to pay and EMI liabilities to take care of, the sudden truncation of income can let loose untold trauma. One must understand that losing a job is not only a function of macro factors, but could also be due to the company’s or your own poor performance. Whatever the reason, dismissals seldom come without warnings. Here we list six indicators to show if you are on the verge of losing your job and the steps you should take to mitigate this risk.



You have got poor appraisal & increment

Have you got consistently poor appraisals and less-than-average increments for two-three years running? It is a red flag that is hard to miss. It could also reflect the industry or sector trend. Low increments must not be seen in isolation. If these are low across the board, it could be due to company’s underperformance or cost-cutting measures. If not, take the hint.


What to do: The first step is to talk to your boss or HR official to know the reason for the poor increment.“Have another chat to fix targets that are linked to the next promotion and obtain commitments and resources for the same,” says Devashish Chakravarty, CEO, QuezX.com & Head Honchos.


You are losing out on plum projects

Are important assignments that you handled earlier being passed on to others? Are you being left out of meetings that used to give credence to your inputs? It’s also possible that budgetary constraints are being imposed on you. All these are surefire indicators that you are no longer in favour. A common culprit is competitiveness. Insecurity or rivalry could see your immediate boss or team member taking credit for your inputs or creating an impression that you are not contributing well. You may have said or done something that has not gone down well with the bosses.


What to do: Firstly, introspect if you have been the cause of your own downfall. If you can’t pinpoint it, talk to colleagues or your manager.

Have a candid chat with your boss to understand and what you can do to change the situation. If the fault lies with you, accept it and rectify it. If, however, the problem has become deep-seated and you can’t resolve it, start looking for a new job.


You are not learning new skills at work

You should start to feel concerned if you have been performing the same tasks at work for more than a couple of years. If you are not innovating, improvising and outperforming to contribute to the company’s profits or visibility, you are likely to be branded a non-performer, which could translate to an early exit.


What to do: “It makes sense to ask for intervention if one has hit a plateau in one’s career” says Paul Dupuis, MD & CEO, Randstad India. You could also shift laterally in the organisation to fit into a role that suits your skills. Make sure you upgrade your skills. To ensure that you stay ahead of the curve, learn to exit the comfort zone. “Volunteer new stuff, suggest initiatives, help colleagues, look for lateral transfers, and train to up your game,” says Chakravarty.


Machines are starting to replace you at work

Automation and artificial intelligence have signalled distress for many employees. As per a survey on the future of jobs in India by EY and Nasscom, technology adoption will change the job scenario by 2022. So what are the indicators that you could be replaced by a machine? “The roles that require manual intervention, follow a standardised procedure and are repeatable will be impacted. Machine learning and robotic process automation will reduce number of people required for customer service, back-office and testing roles, impacting ITeS, IT and consumer-facing industries,” says Dupuis. The other jobs include those in BPOs, data entry and basic banking operations.


What to do: “AI is here to stay and the sooner we understand it, the better it will be. The one way to combat it is to acquire new skills,” says Neeti Sharma, Senior Vice-President, TeamLease. You will not only need to keep up with the pace of digitisation by improving tech skills, but also focus on more niche segments. Another way is to upskill yourself by opting for in-house courses or getting fresh degrees.


Your relationship with boss is deteriorating

Has your boss started ignoring your suggestions and mails, or is criticising your work? Are you having verbal spats with him in front of colleagues? If the disagreement is healthy, ignore it. But if the problem is deeper, spawning from personal or professional reasons, you will either have to fix the relationship or quit.


What to do: The first step is to identify the problem. If it is professional and you are at fault, take responsibility and find ways to improve. Seek a role or job where you can add more value because if you don’t trust your boss, or vice versa, you will never be able to deliver your best.

“If, on the other hand, the problem is personal, be outstanding professionally and impeccable in social behavior,” says Chakravarty. It’s difficult to get rid of an over-achiever or a popular person.


Your firm is cutting costs, has hiring freeze

Your job could be in danger not for any fault of yours, but simply because the industry or your company is going through a bad phase. In such a case, it could impose temporary cost-cutting measures in the form of withdrawal of perks or a hiring freeze. If things become worse, the firm may even consider letting go of its employees. If this happens, the staffers in non-core functions will be the first to exit. You could also lose your job if the company undergoes a change in business strategy, or if it witnesses a merger and reorganisation. Another indicator is the loss of senior-most employees or star performers. A new boss could result in firings as well.


What to do: To prepare youself better, keep tabs on the company’s performance, as well as the sector, in the broader context. A gradual exodus of staffers and persistently low increments could also indicate danger to your job. If you suspect firings, update your resume, circulate it among head hunters and start the search for a new job immediately.


What not to do if you are at risk…

To protect your job and reputation, don’t react impulsively and remain professional


Don’t bad-mouth the boss

You haven’t lost your job yet. Talking ill about your boss or firm on social media may hasten your exit. Or worse, it will reflect poorly on your ethics if seen by prospective employers, scuttling your chances of a new job.


Don’t rush to quit your job

There’s a chance that you may not lose your current job. By acting hastily and accepting the first job offer that comes your way, you may find yourself saddled with a worse job without recourse to an easy exit.


Don’t be unprofessional

Even if you think you are losing your job, don’t stop working. If at all, work harder and put in your best performance. Your work ethic and professionalism may be noticed and things may turn out differently for you.


Update your resume

Don’t preempt your dismissal, but be prepared. Update your resume and circulate it. Start a discreet search for a new job without letting others know about it.


Control emotions at work

Don’t be frazzled by the negativity in office or rumours about your impending lay-off. Remain calm and don’t talk about your fears or feelings to colleagues. Don’t become offensive or defensive and certainly don’t grovel before your boss to save your job.

RBI: WhatsApp yet to comply with data localisation norms 

","
BENGALURU: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said that the popular messaging platform WhatsApp is not in compliance with the central bank’s data localisation norms in India. RBI’s comments come as response in an affidavit, reviewed by TOI, filed with the SC on Wednesday after the apex court made the central bank a party to a writ petition in January.


This is the first time the central bank has made an official statement on WhatsApp’s payments business and compliance with data localisation. WhatsApp, which is owned by social networking giant Facebook, has now been operating its payments business — WhatsApp Pay — in beta-mode for a year, restricted to one million users. The RBI also said it is exploring regulatory actions to expedite compliance of data localisation. However, it is being cautious to make sure a consumer’s transaction experience is not disrupted by any such measures. 




Centre for Accountability and Systemic Change, an NGO, had filed the petition challenging WhatsApp’s compliance standards and absence of a local grievance officer here. “As informed by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) on November 16, 2018 and February 5, 2019, WhatsApp is non-compliant with the RBI circular (on data localisation),” RBI’s response in the affidavit said. WhatsApp entered payments in India through Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which is run by NPCI. The original petition also challenged the Menlo Park-based company of non-payment of local taxes. 

The RBI has maintained that payments service providers and third-party payments app should follow its April 6 circular on data localisation, which mandates storage of key payments data only in India. The operative word here is — only — which payments companies had requested the RBI to omit. The RBI did not entertain the request.

Sources said WhatsApp’s newly appointed head for India — Abhijit Bose — recently met NPCI MD & CEO Dilip Asbe in Mumbai to discuss the regulatory concerns and hoping to accelerate the process of obtaining a final nod to roll out its payments service full-scale. For WhatsApp, India is its largest market with over 200 million monthly active users here. An email sent to WhatsApp India spokesperson did not elicit a response at the time of going to press. 

In October last year, WhatsApp said it built a system that stores payments-related data locally in India. NPCI, however, thought it was not enough since WhatsApp was merely mirroring or copying the payments data in India. It keeps the same in its overseas servers as well. 

Issues related to fake news and the government’s request to allow message traceability have only added to WhatsApp’s woes in India, ahead of general elections. TOI had previously reported how these non-payments issues have also emerged as a roadblock for the company’s payments operations here. To be sure, foreign payments players like Mastercard, Visa, Google and others are still in the process of complying with RBI’s data localisation guidelines. According to industry sources, these companies have given various timelines within 2019 by when they expect to be fully compliant with the norms.

Sharad Pawar: NCP deals Congress big blow in Gujarat, to fight all 26 seats 

","
AHMEDABAD: Sharad Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party on Thursday dealt a blow to Congress by announcing that it would contest all 26 Lok Sabha seats in Gujarat. Both Congress and NCP have adopted a combative stance, though both also say there is still scope for an alliance as the last day for filing nominations is April 4.


""NCP will go ahead and announce its candidates for all 26 seats in the next two or three days,"" NCP state chief Jayant Patel said, indicating a faltering of talks. With just a week to go before the last day for filing nominations and the tie-up not working out, it appears NCP will play spoilsport yet again for Congress.

NCP's fielding of candidates on all seats along with five assembly seats where bypolls are to be held will translate into a straight division in the anti-BJP votes.

NCP had sought Porbandar, Panchmahal and Gandhinagar seats as part of the seat-sharing formula.

Although Congress and NCP have been natural allies at the national level for long, the two have not been able to stitch a sustainable alliance in Gujarat. They had a prepoll alliance in the 2004 and 2014 general elections in Gujarat. Congress left the Rajkot LS seat for NCP in 2004 and the Porbandar LS seat in 2014. NCP lost on both occasions. The two parties did not have any pre-poll alliance in Gujarat in the 1999 and 2009 general elections. NCP fielded candidates on seven seats in 1999, all of whom lost, and again on seven seats in 2009. No NCP candidate won in 2009 either.

In the 2017 assembly elections, after alliance talks between Congress and NCP collapsed at the last minute, NCP fielded 58 candidates, and registered a win on the Kutiyana seat. However, NCP cost Congress five assembly seats - Prantij, Dholka, Umreth, Fatehpara and Dangs. If an alliance would have happened between Congress and NCP, BJP would have been reduced to 94 seats in the assembly.

tej pratap yadav: Bihar: Demanding tickets for 2 aides, Tej Pratap quits party post 

","
PATNA: RJD chief Lalu Prasad's elder son Tej Pratap, who had otherwise been keeping silent since the declaration of the Lok Sabha election dates, dropped two bombshells on Thursday by resigning as chief of the party's student wing and seeking tickets for his candidates of choice for Jehanabad and Sheohar seats.


""I am resigning as chief of Chhatra RJD. Naadan hain woh log jo mujhe naadan samajhte hain (Those who think I am naive are mistaken),"" he tweeted. Earlier in the day, Tej said that he had apprised his younger brother Tejashwi of his two choices. He refuted reports that he would form his own party.

Tej said his picks Angesh Singh (Sheohar) and Chandra Prakash (Jehanabad) were dedicated to RJD. RJD sources, however, said the party was likely to field Surendra Yadav from Jehanabad.

Samjhauta blasts case: Aseemanand confession not voluntary, unreliable, says judge 

","
CHANDIGARH: The special NIA court, in its rebuttal of charges framed by the agency in the Samjhauta Express blasts case, held that the January 2011 confession of Swami Aseemanand in which he had admitted his role in the case before the Panchkula court was not voluntary and could not be relied upon. Aseemanand was acquitted in the case last week along with three other accused.


On January 15, 2011, Aseemanand had allegedly confessed before the CJM Panchkula under Section 164 of CrPc about his role in Samjhauta blast case. However, on May 12, 2011, he had retracted his confession and said he had been coerced to confess by the investigating agencies.

""From the circumstances leading to recording of the statement under Section 164 of CrPc of accused Aseemanand... and... in the light of the fact that said accused retracted from his statement at the earliest opportunity and in view of the reasons given in the application that investigating officers tortured him both physically and mentally and compelled him to give statement before magistrate as per their dictation, a reasonable doubt may be entertained about the voluntary nature of the statement made by accused Aseemanand,"" special NIA judge Jagdeep Singh observed in his order, which was released on Thursday.

Moreover, according to the judge, a bare perusal of the retracted confession reveals that the confession is long but rambling, which could have been pieced together only after some sort of tutoring. Still further, since retracted confession has not found general corroboration from other evidence, therefore, very truthfulness of the statement also comes under cloud, the judge observed.

Referring to Aseemanand's ""confessional"" statement, the NIA judge observed it is nowhere made out that the accused had ever entertained any idea or intention or had any agreement with any other accused/suspect to carry out Samjhauta Express train blast, meaning thereby that he has exculpated himself totally so far as present crime is concerned.

""Even though it is stated in the retracted statement that in March 2006, Sunil Joshi came to meet him at Shabri Dham and said that a SIM card and a pistol may be procured from Jharkhand for which Aseemanand gave Rs 25,000 to Joshi. However, this statement including the above-noted contents do not reveal that SIM card or pistol had been procured to carry out Samjhauta Express train blast and moreover it is nowhere the case of the prosecution that any SIM card or any pistol had been used in execution of the Samjhauta Express train incident and thus, retracted confession of accused Aseemanand is not self-incriminating at all,"" observed the judge while giving a clean chit to Aseemanand.

Exonerating other co-accused booked along with Aseemanand, the judge held that once it is made out that Aseemanand had exculpated himself in the entire confessional statement, then the same cannot be used to convict other co-accused who are being tried jointly with the person who had retracted his confession.


From the judgment

Short time for reflection
""The accused was given merely 10 minutes for reflection when produced by NIA officials for his confessional statement. It was not sufficient for reflection in view of the fact that he was in custody of NIA for more than 20 days in the present case and for many days in the custody of the CBI prior to that and as such, this much time was not sufficient for the accused to come out of the influence/ pressure/coercion exerted upon him during his such long police custody""


Constant pressure by NIA
""During the first remand of the accused from December 23, 2010 to January 3, 2011, no concrete investigation was done by agency and during the next spell of police remand on January 3-13, 2011, the accused taken to Daman for one day on January 6, 2011, and one disclosure memo and three pointing out memos along with respective site plans were prepared and no other evidence was collected, which itself reflects that NIA officials were constantly pressurising the accused to make statement u/s 164 CrPc as per their dictation""

Hyderabad man tells family he is being held captive in Bangladesh; mother urges Sushma Swaraj for help 

","
HYDERABAD: Mystery shrouds over the disappearance of a 24-year-old man from Hyderabad who is said to have gone to Bangladesh without his parents' knowledge. 

Mohammed Imran had told his family that he was going to Kolkata but made a desparate call from Bangladesh recently. Imran’s mother Zuleqa Begum, a resident of Riyasatnagar on Thursday wrote a letter to union external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj to help locate her son.

Zuleqa said he son had been working in Muttrah in Oman and was there for 15 months working in a dry fruits shop. He came to Hyderabad on December 16, 2018. He had told his family that he had made friends in Oman who were from Bangladesh and was going to Kolkata for a meeting but went to Bangladesh on February 14, 2019.

According to Zuleqa, her son spoke to her recently telling her that he was in Bangladesh. “He said he had been kidnapped and kept in a house along with many others and he does not know his location,” the mother said in the letter to Sushma Swaraj. 

He reportedly spoke to her from an Omani number. He was carrying two phones and both of them have been switched off since he last called her on March 21. He had called the family the first time on February 18 to inform them that he was in Bangladesh.

Before that the family had got in touch with the employer in Oman but he had informed him that in his shop no Bangladeshis were working. Mohammed Imran, had, however, told the family that he had made friends in Oman who were from Bangladesh.

Imran’s mother Zuleqa Begum told TOI that when Imran called her last on March 21, he told her that he was taken to location which he does not know, which is far away from Dhaka. She said the people who he had met there had taken away his passport, money and bag and was not being allowed to return to India.

Zuleqa Begum urged Sushma Swaraj to help her locate her son. She wanted that the Indian high commission in Bangladesh file a police complaint in Bangladesh to find him.

EC clears revised MNREGA wage rates 

","
NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Thursday said it has approved a request of the rural development ministry to revise the wages under the MGNREGA scheme from April 1.


The wages paid under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) are linked with the Consumer Price Index for agricultural labourers (CPI-AL) and new wage rates are notified on April 1, the beginning of the new financial year.

The ministry had approached the EC for approval as the model code for the coming Lok Sabha polls is in force.

""We have given conditional nod,"" said deputy election commissioner Sandeep Saxena.

According to sources, the government has been specifically asked against publicising the hike.

Different states have different wage rates so the increase in wages will also be different. The wages may remain flat in some states, while the increase could be up to 5 per cent over and above the current wage in others.

The government in this year's Interim Budget had proposed to allocate Rs 60,000 crore for rural employment scheme under the MGNREGA for 2019-20.

The amount allocated for the said period is 11 per cent higher compared to Rs 55,000 crore in 2018-19.

MGNREGA, a rural job guarantee scheme introduced in 2005, now covers all the rural districts of the country. 

The main objective of the scheme involves providing up to 100 days of unskilled manual work in a financial year to every household in rural areas as per demand, resulting in creation of productive assets.

No terror camp in India-cited areas: Pakistan on Delhi's dossier 

","
NEW DELHI/ISLAMABAD: Expressing disappointment at Pakistan effectively rejecting India's dossier on Jaish-e-Muhammed's complicity in the Pulwama terror attack, the government on Thursday said Islamabad regrettably continued to be in denial as it even refused to acknowledge Pulwama as a terror attack.


Pakistan, the government said, had not shared details of credible action, if any, taken by it against terrorists or terrorist organisations based in territories under its control.

Indian high commissioner Ajay Bisaria sought concrete and irreversible action against terror sanctuaries in a meeting with Pakistani officials on Wednesday.

""We are hardly surprised, as this identical script was followed by Pakistan in the past, after the terror attacks in Mumbai in 2008 or in Pathankot in 2016. It is a well-known fact that the JeM and its leader Masood Azhar are based in Pakistan. This was again acknowledged recently to international media by Pakistan's foreign minister. There's no dearth of sufficient actionable information and evidence in Pakistan itself to take action against them, if there is sincerity and intent to do so,"" the government said in a statement, while adding that it was still examining the paper handed over by Pakistan.

Pakistan earlier on Thursday rejected the dossier submitted by India on the Pulwama attack and said the preliminary investigation established no links of any Pakistani, including Azhar, with the suicide bombing. Pakistan's foreign ministry also denied the existence of the 22 terrorist camps in Pakistan which had been mapped by India in its 91-page document.

A ministry of foreign affairs (MoFA) statement said that while 54 detainees were being investigated, no evidence linking them to Pulwama attack had been found so far. ""Similarly, the 22 pin locations shared by India have been examined. No such camps exist. Pakistan is willing to allow visits, on request, to these locations,"" the statement said. Amid pressure from the global community, Pakistani authorities had taken Azhar's son and brother in ""preventive custody"" in the first week of March.

India also asked Pakistan to abide by the commitment it gave in 2004 vowing not to allow any territory under its control to be used for terrorism against India. Pakistani foreign office spokesperson Mohammad Faisal said on Thursday that Pakistan had informed India that it was ready to cooperate if they have actionable intelligence and evidence that would pass muster with Pakistani courts.

Why not Varanasi? Priyanka on party workers' plea to fight from Rae Bareli

RAE BARELI: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi on Thursday sent ripples across the political spectrum after her swift riposte ""Why not Varanasi"" (the Lok Sabha seat of Prime Minister Narendra Modi) to party workers' request to contest elections from her mother Sonia Gandhi's parliamentary constituency Rae Bareli.

Her remark came at an interactive meeting with party booth workers, block presidents, gram panchayat and nagar panchayat heads at a guest house here, about six km from the district headquarters.

In likely first, Supreme Court uses Met data to reject contractor's insurance claim 

","
NEW DELHI: Meteorological data is beneficial for many sectors, including agriculture and aviation, but the Supreme Court used such data probably for the first time to reject a contractor's insurance claim for damage to roads by ""heavy rains"".


Mahavir Road and Infrastructure Pvt Ltd had undertaken a contract for resurfacing of roads in Nashik in 2007. Since the work was covered under an insurance policy, the contractor filed a claim for compensation with the insurance company for damage to the roads because of ""heavy rains"" between June 25 and July 5, 2007.

The contractor intimated the insurance company that ""due to heavy rains on June 29, 2007, the roads were inundated and the top layer had been washed out"". The insurer rejected the claim on the ground that damage was caused due to defective workmanship and material and because of failure to provide an alternative route for traffic, which continued on the newly laid roads.

According to the surveyor employed by the insurer to examine the claim, ""there was no evidence of any damage on account of flood water and only surface damage was found. The data of the meteorological department indicated minimal rains on the alleged dates of damage"".

A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and Hemant Gupta noted that the contractor claimed there was abnormal rainfall and water logging between June 25 and July 5, 2007. Later, it claimed that heavy rains on June 29, 2007, inundated the roads and the top layer got washed away.

Referring to the meteorological data, as relied upon by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) while rejecting the claim, the SC bench said there was no rain at all on June 29 or even on June 30. Rainfall from June 25 to July 1 was nil or nominal.

Relying on the surveyor's report and the NCDRC findings, the bench said, ""In order to establish that this was not a case involving normal wear and tear, the firm sought to rely upon what it described as abnormal rainfall and water logging. The evidence on record (meteorological data) did not sustain the basis of such a claim. In this view of the matter and for the reasons we have indicated, we are unable to come to the conclusion that the order passed by NCDRC suffered from any error.""

Lok Sabha elections: How BJP beats Congress in turning votes into seats 

","
Much of BJP's dominance in electoral politics in the past five years has been credited to PM Modi and party chief Amit Shah. While the duo did lead BJP to a sweeping majority in 2014, the ground for that may have been laid much before their time.


Analysis of election data from 1996 to 2009, including the two terms of the Congress-led UPA, shows that the strike rate of BJP contestants was far better than those fielded by the grand old party. The percentage of BJP candidates winning was higher in all but one election (2009), including in 2004 when the UPA-I assumed office.

That Congress also fielded more candidates than BJP could have affected its winning percentage, but as experts explain, ""BJP's success in building a national narrative had been in the pipeline since 1992"".




Veteran BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa told TOI: ""Narendra Modi was a Gujarat CM and was working in that capacity for the party. But from the time of Vajpayee, we worked across the breadth and length of this country with leaders like Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi, and at a time all this was taking a more concrete shape, Modi was projected as the PM candidate and naturally it got converted into votes.""

1n 1999, when the BJP-led NDA came to power under Vajpayee, 57% of BJP candidates had won, against 25% from the rival party.

In 1996, 34% of all BJP contestants won, compared to 26% of Congress candidates; in 2004, when UPA eventually formed the government, 38% of BJP candidates won, against 35% for Congress. In 1998 and 1999, when NDA ruled, BJP candidates had a much higher winnability record compared to Congress.

""You can map the timeline of how we grew from Gujarat and Rajasthan to Karnataka and the northeast. It was between 1996 and 1998 that the party emerged nationally. In 2014, we did reach the peak as there was 'partial consolidation' because of the spiralling growth of the middle class and youth which came in handy,"" BJP spokesperson Krishna Sagar Rao said.

At a discussion last month, psephologists spoke of how the 2014 LS polls were critical in setting the ground for a narrative on New India. ""If BJP comes back to power you will see this narrative getting stronger by 2024. But even if the party fails to retain power, the idea won't die, such was the nature of the elections in 2014,"" said Suhas Palshikar.

""India Shining may not have worked for BJP electorally in that year (2004), but the exercise of building a national narrative that has engaged people had begun and that was the first attempt. Today, the Naya Bharat campaign is not just a linguistic nuance but a sustained effort at consolidation,"" Palshikar said.

The Indian warship is carrying 300 tonnes of relief supplies including essential medicines, anti–epidemic drugs, food provisions, clothing, repair and rehabilitation equipment, and temporary shelters.


Defence spokesperson said the ship is also carrying a naval Chetak Light Utility helicopter that will be used in the ongoing relief operations. “She is bound for Port Beira and will become the fourth Indian Navy ship after INS Sujata, Shardul and Sarathi of 1 Training Squadron to augment the Indian Navy's ongoing Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) efforts in Mozambique,” said the official.





INS Magar, a Landing Ship Tank (Large) of the Indian Navy was built by Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers Ltd. Kolkata and commissioned on July 18, 1987.

The major operations undertaken by the ship include Op Pawan (Indian Peace Keeping Force - IPKF operations in Sri Lanka), wherein she played a pivotal role in movement of logistics supplies to the area of operations, to support the IPKF land forces. The most noteworthy operation was in the wake of the 2004 Tsunami, wherein the ship had provided relief for over 1300 survivors.

I-T raids several ‘individuals’ in Karnataka, CM Kumaraswamy leads protest 

","
BENGALURU: Income-tax raids on aides of top coalition leaders in Karnataka early Thursday brought Congress and JD(S) together once again. Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy led a joint protest against the central agency, calling the searches 'revenge politics' by the Modi government.


The CM addressed Congress-JD(S) workers outside the I-T office here, following raids on aides of top leaders of both parties in the Old Mysuru region. Kumaraswamy singled out BR Balakrishnan, principal chief commissioner of I-T (Karnataka and Goa region), in his fusillade against the department. ""We are not against raids. But we protest selective raids conducted in Mysuru, Mandya, Hassan, Shivamogga and Kanakapura. Don't work as agents of the NDA government in its last hours,'' the CM said.

The income tax department said no MP, MLA or minister had been covered in the ongoing searches in Karnataka. Though the department, till late Thursday evening, didn't identify individuals whose properties were searched, sources privy to the developments revealed some details. According to sources, 20 premises of eight individuals, including minor irrigation minister CS Puttaraju's relatives in Mandya and Mysuru were searched.

""Among those whose properties were raided include a senior JD(S) leader in Bengaluru, a business venture of a relative of former PM HD Deve Gowda in Shivamogga, offices of PWD in Hassan and taluk office in Kanakapura. The office of a Congress leader in Kanakapura too was raided,"" they said.

Kumaraswamy, who had Congress leaders Siddaramaiah, G Parameshwara, DK Shivakumar, Dinesh Gundurao and JD(S) ministers by his side during his address to the workers of the two parties, took exception to raids on government offices in Hassan and Kanakapura. ""Raid the Hassan PWD engineer's house, not his office. Visit my office in Vidhana Soudha too. Income-tax officials think they are above reproach and descendants of Harishchandra. Everyone knows how a 'settlement' takes place after a raid,'' he alleged.

After predicting on Wednesday that 300 CRPF personnel would arrive in Bengaluru to assist in the raids, a furious Kumaraswamy on Thursday said he, too, can unleash the Anti-Corruption Bureau on tax sleuths.

Later, in a tweet, the chief minister accused the PM of misusing the income tax department to threaten Congress and JD(S) leaders during elections. ""This is revenge politics; we won't be cowed down by this,"" he said.

New cess and concept of private forest proposed in draft law for growing green cover in India, Critics see red 

","
NEW DELHI: The Centre’s draft amendment to the Indian Forest Act, which drew criticism for giving higher immunity to forest officers for use of firearms, has ‘many firsts’ as part of its comprehensive proposals, ranging from the introduction of a new cess to promotion of ‘private forest’ for nature-based tourism and provisions of enhanced penalty and jail terms for offenders under new categorisation of offences.


The 123-page draft, which states can comment on till June 7, proposes a forest development cess that can be deposited in a “special fund” and the amount used exclusively for reforestation, forest protection and other ancillary purposes connected with tree planting, forest development and conservation.

It provides for empowering the state governments to levy cess up to 10% of the value assessed of mining products removed from the forests and water used for irrigation or in industries.



“The said forest development cess shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any duty or tax payable in respect of such produce under any law in force,” says section 39 (A) of the proposed amended Act which is intended to replace the British period IFA, 1927.

These provisions have, however, received mixed reactions from experts and stakeholders whom TOI spoke to on Thursday. 

While member of the drafting committee of the IFA, 2019 and Supreme Court lawyer Sanjay Upadhyay argued why amendments are necessary for meeting “national development aspirations and international commitments”, legal researcher at the Centre for Policy Research (CPR) Kanchi Kohli pointed at several associated risks which she believes may adversely affect forest-based livelihoods.

Questioning the proposal to have new cess, Kohli said, “This will allow forest laws to continue monetising forest destruction. The cess like other offset mechanisms will only be relevant till resource extraction continues.”

Another expert, Ajay Kumar Saxena of the Network for Certification and Conservation of Forests (NCCF), on the other hand, welcomed the cess as it will “bring additional funds to forestry exchequer” but expressed his concerns over poor record of forest department in utilising the compensatory afforestation fund in the past.

Under the concept of ‘private forests’, the state government may recognise and notify private forest at the request of the owner in a prescribed manner provided “such forest are used primarily for conservation and preservation including protecting water catchments”.

“Such notified private forest may also be permitted for nature-based tourism involving local communities and which is aimed at improving local livelihoods,” says section 80(A) of the draft proposal.

“The proposal is a welcome move to engage private land owners to grow forests on their land and manage these with government support. This will inculcate positive conservation spirit in public,” said Saxena.

He, however, suggested that the process should be “completely voluntary” and trees grown in agroforestry and farms should be allowed to be grown for commercial purposes without any hassles from governance on harvesting. “India is already a net and big importer of wood. Therefore, government should enable all policies and measures to enhance tree production areas, without compromising on conservation areas,” he said.

Kohli differed with him on this proposed clause. She said, “This clause needs to be read with the policy measures in the last few years which have encouraged private sector investment in forests. It risks the shifting focus from forest conservation to production forestry. It will encourage more plantations and and impinge on forest based livelihoods.”

The provisions which may act as a deterrent for offenders include enhanced punishment for those who are found violating the forest law. At present, such people can be punished with imprisonment up to one month, or fine up to Rs 500 or both. But the new proposals enhance it with provisions for imprisonment ranging from one month to seven years or more depending on nature of offences and fine of Rs 5,000 to Rs 5 lakh.

“The criticism of a more stringent law needs to be understood in the context of timber mafia, wild species cartels and organized illegal trade which has perpetrated into the forest management system. The fear of misuse of stringent provisions cannot be a reason to deal strongly with serious forest offenders who have plundered our forests,” said Upadhyay.

He said, “I see community engagement including the role of traditional forest dwellers as a vehicle to nab illegal miscreants rather than they themselves being victimized.”

Noting certain other new provisions in the draft, Upadhyay said, “The offences have also been categorized into a major and minor offences...The criminal provisions of the Act have only been aligned with the criminal procedure code.”

Kohli has, however, a different take on it. She said, “Fines have rarely been deterrents against forest destruction. The big violators use all their strength to challenge and evade this. This puts all the attention on forest dwellers who may or may not be in violation of the law and enforcement needs to be logged in.

“It is true that poaching and timber mafia need to be controlled, but that requires innovative monitoring mechanisms and partnerships in forest based livelihoods rather than fines/penalties.”

Upadhyay believes that there are several new provisions in the draft which the critics ignored. He said such provisions included the definition of ‘community’; a focus on ‘village forest’ which has never been put to use since the inception of the law itself; the clarity on ‘forest’ and ‘forest land’ which never existed and the coverage of other categories of forest keeping in mind a new pragmatic approach to production forestry.

“The two important aspects of ‘community forestry’ and ‘production forests’ to my mind are the most important pillars of this law to unleash the potential of community engagement as well as the unlocked opportunities of production forestry,” he said.

","
PATNA/NEW DELHI: Tension erupted between Congress and RJD on Thursday, forcing them to cancel a press conference that had been scheduled to declare the names of 31 candidates of the anti-BJP front in Bihar.

Article 35A 'constitutionally vulnerable': Arun Jaitley 

","
NEW DELHI: Citing several ways in which Article 35A of the Constitution was hurting people of J&K, finance minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday called the legislation ""constitutionally vulnerable"" and questioned its existence, asking why the rule of law that applied to the rest of the country did not apply to the state.


""Article 35A was surreptitiously included by a presidential notification in the Constitution in 1954. It discriminates between permanent residents of the state and all other Indian citizens living elsewhere. Lakhs of Indian citizens in J&K vote in Lok Sabha elections but not in the assembly, municipal or panchayat polls.

Their children cannot get government jobs. They cannot own property and their children cannot get admitted to government institutions. The same applies to those who live elsewhere in the country. The heirs of ladies marrying outside the state are disinherited from owing or inheriting property,"" 
Jaitley said in a blog post on Thursday. He said no investor was willing to set up an industry, hotel, private educational institution or private hospital since he could neither buy land or property nor could his wards get government jobs or admission to colleges.

""Article 35A has prevented investment and dismantled the state's economy. Article 35A, which is constitutionally vulnerable, is used as a political shield by many but it hurt the common citizen of the state the most. It denied them a booming economy, economic activity and jobs,"" he said.

The FM said the state's seven-decade history confronted India with several questions. ""Was the Nehruvian course a historical blunder or was it the correct course to follow? Most Indians today believe that it is the former,"" he added.

Questioning why the rule of law that applied to the rest of the country did not apply to the state, Jaitley asked, ""Should violence, separatism, mass stone throwing, vicious ideological indoctrination be allowed on the plea that if we check it, it will have a negative effect. It is this misconceived policy that has proved to be counter-productive.""

He said the present government had decided that the rule of law must equally apply to J&K in the interest of the people of Kashmir Valley and the larger interest of India.

Supreme Court to hear fresh plea on CBI probe in Muzaffarpur shelter home case after 2 weeks 

","
NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear after two weeks a fresh plea alleging that CBI tried to ""shield the real perpetrators"" in the Muzaffarpur shelter home case by not conducting proper probe on ""crucial leads"" which are available on record.


Several girls were allegedly raped and sexually abused at an NGO-run shelter home at Muzaffarpur in Bihar and the issue had come to light following a report by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS).

The probe into the case was transferred to CBI and the agency has chargesheeted 21 people, including prime accused Brajesh Thakur.

The fresh application was mentioned on Thursday for urgent hearing before a bench of justices S A Bobde and S A Nazeer which said the matter would be heard after two weeks.

The plea, filed through advocate Fauzia Shakil, has sought a direction to the CBI to carry out a thorough, proper and scientific probe into the case.

""It is evident from the statement of victims that a large scale prostitution racket was being run by prime accused Brajesh Thakur.

""From the perusal of the charge sheet, it is apparent that CBI is trying to shield the real perpetrators and has intentionally avoided to investigate the leads given by the victims about the outsiders and alleged friends of Thakur who were involved in the offence,"" the plea said.

It also claimed that victims have stated in their statement to CBI that they were sent to hotels and were also raped by outsiders and friends of Thakur who visited the shelter home.

It further alleged that despite statement of the victims which disclosed grave and serious cognisable offences like rape, murder, gang rapes, prostitution racket and trafficking, the CBI has not chargesheeted the accused under the relevant penal provisions.

The plea sought identification of accused as per law on the basis of statements of victim and further probe to establish identity of Thakur's ""guests, uncles and friends"", who had visited the shelter home.

It also urged the court to direct CBI to carry out further investigation on the issues highlighted by the apex court in its September 20 last year order regarding Thakur's connections and antecedents and also about culpability of Bihar social welfare department, if any, in the case.

""No effort was made by the CBI to look into the antecedents, connections and influence of Thakur,"" the plea said.

""The charge sheet does not disclose that any investigation has been conducted to ascertain whether the social welfare department of the Bihar government was aware of criminal activities being carried out in the shelter home and that may have bene the reason for transfer of the victim girls"", it said.

The apex court had in February transferred the case from Bihar to a Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) court in Saket District court complex in Delhi.

On November 28 last year, the top court had directed the CBI to conduct probe into allegations of physical and sexual abuse of inmates in 16 other shelter homes in Bihar which were flagged in the TISS report.

HC pulls up Maharashtra CM over Pansare probe 

","
MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Thursday frowned at CM Devendra Fadnavis, saying although he holds the home department portfolio, he finds no time to take stock of the case related to the killing of CPI leader Govind Pansare.


""What is the CM doing? He holds 11 portfolios, including home department, but do (sic) not find the time to take stock of the case,"" remarked a bench of Justices Satyaranjan Dharmadhikari and Burgess Colabawalla, which is monitoring the probe. On March 14, the court had said the attempt of the state CID's SIT to trace the absconding accused has been reduced to a ""laughing stock.""

Counsel for the state, senior advocate Ashok Mundargi said the strength of the probe team has been increased to nearly 35. ""We will continue with the same investigating officer. His work will be reviewed every 15 days by the SIT chief,"" he added.

Digvijaya Singh says sorry for ‘bhool’ of 2003 

","
BHOPAL: In the run-up to the 2003 assembly polls, Digvijaya Singh had angered government staff by saying elections were won with sound ""management and not with the help of state government employees"". Aware of the power they wield, Singh has now apologized and asked them to forgive the ""bhool-chook (mistake) 15 years ago"".


Bhopal alone has 2 lakh state staff and pensioners.

The anger of government employees was one of the major factors believed to have led to Digvijaya's defeat in 2003 and the start of 15 years of BJP rule. On Wednesday evening, Singh attended the state employees' Holi Milan Samaroh in Bhopal and sought forgivance. ""Fifteen years have passed. It is time for Holi celebrations. Forgive me for any mistakes I have made,"" he said.

Mantralaya Employees' Union president Sudhir Nayak said it is ""good to apologise"" and pointed out that a voter also keeps in mind a neta's track record. ""Kamal Nath has not taken any major step for employees so far, but employees have a big heart and they will forgive Digvijaya,"" he said.

Why is BJP opposing Rahul's minimum income scheme, asks Congress 

","
GUNA: The Congress in Madhya Pradesh on Thursday said party chief Rahul Gandhi's minimum income scheme was the final assault on poverty and wondered why the BJP was opposing it.


Talking to reporters here, state Congress spokesman Pankaj Chaturvedi said the poor were suffering under the NDA government.

""Rahul ji has said if the Congress was voted to power, its government would roll out a minimum income scheme guaranteeing Rs 72,000 a year to poorest 20 per cent of the households in the country,"" he said.

The scheme will benefit 25 crore people,"" he claimed.

""I wonder why the BJP and the Prime Minister have got into the habit of opposing the Congress's schemes for public welfare,"" he added.

Earlier, they had opposed our public welfare schemes like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) and the National Food Security Act,"" Chaturvedi added.

The poor were facing a tough time ever since the National democratic alliance (NDA) government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi came into power at the Centre, he alleged.

Unemployment, too, had risen manifold under the Modi government, the Congress spokesman claimed.

Besides, the NDA government's decisions like the 2016 note-ban and implementation of GST had ruined the economy and also the poor, he said.

Dastardly act left unpunished: Court on Samjhauta blast 

","
PANCHKULA: The special National Investigation Agency (NIA) judge, Jagdeep Singh, who acquitted Swami Aseemanand and three others in the 2007 Samjhauta blasts case on March 20 said in his judgment made available on Thursday that he was deeply pained the dastardly act of violence had remained unpunished for want of credible and admissible evidence.


Making his anguish clear, the judge observed in in the 160-page judgment: ""I have to conclude this judgment with deep pain and anguish as a dastardly act of violence remained unpunished for want of credible and admissible evidence. There are gaping holes in the prosecution evidence and an act of terrorism has remained unsolved.""

The judgment highlighted uneasiness about ""malaise"" in the investigating agencies to equate terrorism with religion, saying, ""terrorism has no religion because no religion in the world preaches violence.""

""It is generally noticed a malaise has set in the investigating agencies which coin various terms like Muslim terrorism, Hindu fundamentalism etc or brand an act of criminals as acts of particular religion, caste or community. A criminal element, belonging to a particular religion, community or caste, cannot be projected as representative of such particular religion, community or caste and branding the entire community, caste or religion in the name of such criminal element(s) would be totally unjustified and it would be in the best interests of human kind to nip such tendencies in the bud lest we should be heading towards intense civil war or caught in a whirlpool of fratricide,"" the judgment added.

The judge made a strong case for peaceful co-existence ""lest the sentiments of mutual hatred or false notions of supremacy over one other would engulf the planet.""

The NIA miserably failed to prove charges against the accused and to adduce evidence beyond reasonable doubt to make out the culpability of the accused, said the judgment. ""The entire prosecution case is found to have been built on inadmissible evidence in the shape of disclosure statements of the accused, without there being any discovery of new fact, recovery of material or object,"" the judge stated.

Highlighting that the court can only depend on the evidence presented by the investigating agencies, the judge said, ""A court of law is not supposed to proceed on popular or predominant public perception or the political discourse of the day and ultimately it has to appreciate the evidence on record and arrive at final conclusion on the basis of relevant statutory provisions and settled law applicable thereto.""

Yet again highlighting the shoddy evidence in the case, the judge said: ""A few bits here and a few bits there on which prosecution relies cannot be held to be adequate or connecting the accused with the crime in question.""

Unfortunate you don’t trust own lawyers: Delhi HC to CBI 

","
NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court took a dim view on Thursday of the CBI's reluctance to share the details of progress in its probe against Rakesh Asthana even with its own lawyers.


Terming it ""unfortunate"", Justice Mukta Gupta wondered why the agency has ""no confidence"" in its own prosecutors and has not shown its status report on the probe in a bribery case involving the agency's then special director, Rakesh Asthana, and others.

""It is unfortunate that even the (CBI) counsel are not privy to it (status report). If you have no confidence in your counsel, what does it show? If your own counsel is not supposed to read it, why should I,"" the judge remarked.

In response, additional solicitor general Vikramjit Banerjee, appearing for the CBI, told the court that the report was not shown to anyone due to sensitivity of the matter and is meant to be examined only by the judge. However, the court did not agree.

On Thursday, the court said it will hear the matter on April 4. The agency sought more time as the 10 weeks granted to it by the HC in January to complete the probe had ended.

Lok Sabha elections: EC likely to urge SC not to change VVPAT protocol 

","
NEW DELHI: Election Commission is likely to request Supreme Court not to alter the system of counting VVPAT paper slips for one randomly-selected polling station per assembly segment when the election process has begun, saying that it has met voter confidence standards.


Sources said EC is likely to inform the court that preparation for deployment of trained poll officials for conduct of general elections is at an advanced stage and it would be fraught with practical difficulties to change the protocol with regard to counting procedures. The current practice has also passed muster with the Indian Statistical Institute.

SC had asked EC if it could on its own increase the number of EVMs per assembly segment whose vote count could be matched with VVPAT paper trails. The query had come on a petition filed by leaders of 21 non-NDA parties led by Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu, who called for a VVPAT paper slip count in at least 50 per cent of EVMs to ""re-establish"" voters' faith in the machines.

The plea followed an intensely political debate with several opposition parties claiming that EVMs were vulnerable to ""hacking"" and suggested that BJP has been a beneficiary of such manipulation. A demonstration by EC that the machines do not have a wireless connection and have been repeatedly tested, failed to quell the dispute.

With the current EC practice of counting paper trail for one polling station per assembly segment purportedly meeting ISI standards for VVPAT slips that need to be counted for maximum voter confidence, the poll watchdog may request SC to let it continue with the practice. However, EC may not be averse to changes in the long term.

TOI has learnt that ISI has suggested alternatives for the absolute number of VVPAT slips to be counted to ensure a given level of people's confidence in fairness and integrity of the poll process. The EC practice of matching paper trail in one polling station each in every assembly segment, said a source, passes the ISI test.

Sources said EC is concerned at practical hurdles in revising the counting protocols with general elections to Lok Sabha and four state assemblies underway. Any change in counting procedures at this stage will require fresh training of officers and staff and more manpower. Doing so in the middle of polls will be a strain on EC as the deployment plans of duly-trained polling and counting staff were worked out well in advance.

Another key concern of the commission is likely delay in results in the event of extent of paper trail tally with EVM count being raised. It be recalled that counting during the last round of assembly polls in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Mizoram held in November-December last year, could be completed only around midnight, with the tightened counting protocols and matching VVPAT and EVM count in one randomly-selected polling station of every assembly constituency taking up extra time.

Rahul Gandhi: Congress will remonetise what Modi demonetised 

","
NEW DELHI: Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said that his party's promised minimum income scheme for the poor would 'remonetise' the economy 'damaged' by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's demonetisation, and asserted that the anti-poverty poll pledge had thrown BJP into 'total disarray'. Rahul also said angel tax for startups would be scrapped if Congress came to power.


'Nyay', which Rahul said would provide Rs 6,000 per month to the poorest 20 per cent of the population, would trigger a powerful cycle of consumption and production that would fire up the economy. He stressed that the scheme would not be implemented ""rashly like BJP's demonetisation and GST"".

He said the scheme was not a ""populist measure"" as has been projected by its critics. Asked about apprehensions of some economists that the scheme, which entails an expenditure of Rs 3.6 lakh crore annually, could aggravate the fiscal situation, Rahul said, ""No, that's not right."" He said the party had consulted a large number of economists and experts before deciding on the scheme.

ED: UAE businessman said ex-OSD of Sonia Gandhi fixed his meet with Robert Vadra 

","
NEW DELHI: A UAE-based businessman has claimed to have known Robert Vadra for the past 10 years after being introduced to him through PP Madhavan, who was an officer on special duty to Sonia Gandhi when she was Congress president, the ED told a special court on Monday.


Before special judge Arvind Kumar, the ED was opposing the anticipatory bail pleas of Vadra and his aide Manoj Arora. ED prosecutor DP Singh and advocate Manu Mishra stressed on the links between the UAE-based businessman, CC Thampi, and Vadra in connection with the purchase of a £1.9 million (about Rs 17.15 crore) mansion and other properties that have given rise to money laundering.

After hearing the arguments, special judge Kumar reserved his order on Vadra's bail plea for April 1.

The ED also informed the court that arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari was suspected to be in London. ""He was the neighbour of Robert Vadra in his younger days and he has also been his friend. It has been acknowledged by Vadra himself. Two deals were done by Bhandari. Money was received in his company by way of contracts,"" Singh submitted.

According to the ED, the London property worth £1.9 million, 12 Bryanstan Square, was bought by the company ""Syntac"", owned by Bhandari, and then bought by Vortex in 2009 through the purchase of Vortex shares. ""Then £60,000 was spent on the mansion's renovation. Thampi bought the mansion later through Sky Light FZE, Dubai, in 2010. The money was then routed back to Syntac,"" submitted Singh.

To show the alleged links between Vadra, Arora, Bhandari and Thampi, the ED referred to several emails exchanged between them. ""There are huge cash withdrawals. There's no income in these companies. These companies do nothing. Cash comes and there are huge withdrawals. I have transcripts of phone records,"" added the ED prosecutor. The agency also referred to a Rs 3,200 crore deal in 2012 for the Swiss Pilatus basic aircraft.

""The entire source of money is suspicious,"" the ED counsel argued. During its investigation, the ED stumbled upon two words - ""sahib"" and ""boss"". ""People close to the political elite make a mockery of the system. Defence deals given to somebody and huge commission. Should I be deprived of investigation,"" Singh submitted while seeking the dismissal of Vadra's plea.

Vadra, through his counsels Abhishek Manu Singhvi and KTS Tulsi, denied having any movable or immovable assets abroad. ""It is nobody's case that I'm the direct owner. The chain (of alleged offences) is stopping at Sky Light. There are a few emails here and there. You just want to link me to Pilatus. I may have known Bhandari. But what then? The ECIR (complaint) does not mention Robert Vadra or Manoj Arora,"" Singhvi submitted.

Finance Bill, 2017 certified as Money Bill by Speaker, court can't interfere: Centre to SC 

","
NEW DELHI: The Centre on Thursday told the Supreme Court that Finance Bill of 2017 was certified as a Money Bill by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha and judicial review of that decision cannot be done.


The government said the court cannot question the speaker's decision of certifying a bill as a Money Bill and it is a well settled law.

A five-judge Constitution bench headed by chief justice Ranjan Gogoi was told by attorney general K K Venugopal, appearing for the Centre, that petitioners' contention that certification of Finance Bill of 2017 as Money Bill was not right and cannot be a ground for a challenge to the Bill.

""The Act of 2017 deals with various aspects of finance. Speaker of the House gave the certification that Finance Act was a Money Bill. Finance Act of 2017 was passed by the Parliament as a Money Bill irrespective of the objections in Rajya Sabha,"" Venugopal said.

The attorney general told the bench also comprising justices N V Ramana, DY Chandrachud, Deepak Gupta and Sanjiv Khanna that apex court has repeatedly held in its verdicts that certification cannot be questioned and courts cannot inquire into the decision taken by Parliament.

""This aspect is consistent with the broad parameters of separation of powers given in the Constitution. Similarly, Parliament cannot interfere with the affairs of judiciary,"" he said.

The attorney general countered the contention of petitioners that Finance Act of 2017 cannot be certified as a Money Bill saying, ""Certification of a particular Act as a Money Bill is an internal functions of the Parliament. If there is any dispute, the Speaker applies his mind and takes a decision. No one can question the bonafide of the Speaker and all members abide by the decision.""

He said Finance Bill comprises of amendments to several Acts and statutes and the petitioners have challenged only one particular aspect saying it cannot be termed as Money Bill.

""The certification of Money Bill is for the whole Finance Bill and saying that a part of the Bill does not qualify for the Money Bill cannot be held to be correct,"" the attorney general said.

The top court is hearing a batch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the Finance Bill of 2017.

During the hearing, senior advocate Arvind Datar, appearing for the petitioners said that the Finance Bill cannot be held as a Money Bill.

The hearing remained inconclusive and would continue on April 2.

On March 27, the apex court had sought centre's view on bringing all the tribunals under one central umbrella body for ensuring ""efficient functioning"" and ""streamlining the working"" of quasi-judicial bodies.

The top court had said it would not like to be bogged down with what is right or wrong and all it wants was that ""the tribunals work efficiently and independently"".

The court had said it is tentatively of the view that directions given by the apex court in its two verdicts of 1997 and 2010 for bringing all the tribunals of the country under one nodal agency should have been ""implemented long back"".

BJP IT cell to project Varanasi as model of success, Amethi of failure 

","
VARANASI: In BJP’s Kashi regional unit, its IT cell is all set to begin a social media war by focusing on Varanasi and Amethi parliamentary constituencies. Varanasi will be projected as a role model of ideal development by its MP while Amethi will be projected as a model of failure under its MP.


The strategy of BJP’s IT cell became clear when its war room was formally made functional at unit’s Gulab Bagh office on Wednesday to provide all data support to organizational level units up to booth committees, candidates and their poll managers in 14 parliamentary constituencies, including Varanasi, Allahabad and Amethi, that fall under its jurisdiction.

“Despite the fact that all 14 LS seats of this region are important for the party, the focus will be on two high-profile constituencies of Varanasi and Amethi,” Kashi regional unit’s IT cell in charge Vaibhav Kapoor told TOI immediately after the cell became operational in view of Lok Sabha polls.

“We have compiled data on all projects and development that took place in Varanasi after Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed officer after winning from this seat. We have also collected details of all projects announced for Amethi by Congress chief Rahul Gandhi as MP along with their current status,” he said.

“Through comparative study of the current status of projects we have concluded that Varanasi has emerged as ideal model of development under Modi while Amethi as ideal example of failure of government projects under its MP,” claimed Kapoor, adding “the cell will wage war on social media with the same issues.”

Regarding Kashi regional unit’s war room, its coordinator Shashi Kumar said eight-10 IT experts will run this war room from early morning till late night till the poll process reaches climax in this region. 

“When campaigning will be intensified in this region after third phase the war room will be operated round the clock,. Through this war room the party will not only handle the social media war, but also share organizational information up to booth level committees to candidates, provide data support to poll managers in all parliamentary constituencies and maintain flow of information especially on all schemes of Modi government. A call centre will also operate with it,” he added.

After the election offices of candidates in all 14 parliamentary constituencies — Varanasi, Chandauli, Ghazipur, Jaunpur, Bhadohi, Mirzapur, Sonbhadra, Machhali Shahar (reserve), Phoolpur, Allahabad, Kaushambi, Sultanpur, Pratapgarh and Amethi — in first week of April, constituency wise war rooms will also be established by district unit IT cells of the party.

Following this, Kapoor said, the regional unit war room will provide essential support to the candidates to with connect with the voters.

Mumbai youth lands Rs 1.2 crore job at Google's London office 

","
MUMBAI: Abdullah Khan (21) may have failed to crack the entrance for IITs, but he has bagged an offer that many IITians would envy. Early this week, Khan landed a job at Google's London office, for a package of Rs 1.2 crore. The average salary offered to a graduate from a non-IIT engineering college in the city is around Rs 4 lakh pa.


Khan, a student of Shree LR Tiwari Engineering College, Mira Road, was called for an interview by Google on the basis of a profile on a site that hosts competitive programming challenges.

After a few online interviews, Khan was asked to appear for the final screening at Google's office in London early this month.

His six-figure package includes the base salary of Rs 54.5 lakh (£60,000) per annum, 15 per cent bonus and stock options worth Rs 58.9 lakh ($85,000) over four years. Khan, who is doing his final year BE (computer science), will join Google's site reliability engineering team in September.

An email from a Google official in November last year mentioned that they had seen Khan's profile on the programming site, and said they were looking for people for locations across Europe.

Khan told TOI he was not expecting such an offer when he participated in competitions on that site. ""I used to participate as it was fun. I did not even know that firms check programmers' profiles on such sites. I showed the email to my friend who knew someone who had received such an email in the past. I am looking forward to joining their team. It will be an amazing learning experience for me,"" said Khan. The coding junkie did his schooling in Saudi Arabia and moved to Mumbai only after Class XII.

SP leader makes sexist remarks against Jaya Prada; gets rap from NCW, Akhilesh 

","
LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Thursday directed party workers not to make indecent comments against women after the National Commission for Women (NCW) pulled up a party leader for allegedly making sexist remarks against actor-turned-politician Jaya Prada.


SP Sambhal district president Firoz Khan had allegedly said Jaya Prada would ""enthral the people of Rampur with her ghungaroos and thumkas"".

In a short video clip, Khan is heard saying ""Rampur ki shaamein rangeen ho jaayengi ab jab chunavi mahual chalega (Rampur's evenings will turn colourful this election season)"", seemingly referring to Jaya Prada, who recently joined the BJP.

Taking note, the NCW issued a notice to Khan, seeking an explanation from him for the remarks.

Following the incident, Yadav issued a statement saying, ""The SP has always given priority to the honour of women and believed in equality of men and women. It has come to the notice of the party that the Sambhal district president made some statement which has created confusion.""

""No party worker should make indecent comments on women. The SP has always believed in respecting women,"" he added.

Reacting to media reports on Khan's comments, NCW under secretary Barnali Shome said, ""The remarks are not only sexist but also extremely offensive, unethical and shows disrespect towards the dignity of women in general.""

The commission strongly condemns such irresponsible and disparaging views from persons holding responsible positions, the notice said to Khan. ""You are hereby requested to provide a satisfactory explanation to the Commission on the matter on receipt of this letter,"" it added.

Jaya Prada, who is a former Samajwadi Party MP, joined the BJP on Tuesday.

US, China clash over Masood Azhar listing 

","
WASHINGTON: Cornered by the international community over their providing continued cover for terrorists, China and Pakistan lashed out over US-led efforts to hold Islamabad accountable on the issue, defiantly insisting on ''dialogue and negotiations'' on the matter of designating Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar a global terrorist. 


China on Thursday accused the US of undermining the authority of the UN anti-terrorism committee after Washington, with support from France and UK, bumped up the issue of listing Azhar to the UN Security Council on Wednesday. The US move came two weeks after China, for the fourth time, put a hold on a proposal to list Azhar under the 1267 Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee of the Council.



Masood Azhar ban: How US move at UNSC may put China in a tight cornerThe US on Thursday moved a draft resolution in the UN Security Council to blacklist the Pakistan-based terror group's chief Masood Azhar.  The US move, supported by France and the UK, may put China in a tight spot. The move by the US could mean China having to explain its block in public, instead of silently using its veto power. 

Although China as a permanent member can also veto the draft resolution in the UNSC, the US-led move further isolates Beijing since it will have to publicly explain why it insists on repeatedly defending the leader of a proscribed terrorist group who himself takes credit for terrorist attacks on India. Proceedings of the sanctions committee were in camera but a UNSC vote, if it comes to that, will be on record. 

It is not clear when the matter will come up for vote, but Beijing is already going through contortions to rationalize its defense of a proclaimed terrorist who had to be freed in exchange for hostages in a hijacked airliner, insisting on process and procedure before it will agree to Azhar's listing. 

""This (US taking it to UNSC) is not in line with resolution of the issue through dialogue and negotiations. This has reduced the authority of the Committee as a main anti-terrorism body of the UNSC and this is not conducive to the solidarity and only complicates the issue. We urge the US to act cautiously and avoid forcefully moving forward this resolution draft,"" China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said in Beijing.

The US-China clash over Azhar came against the backdrop of US secretary of state Mike Pompeo meeting a delegation of Uighur Muslims, tens of thousands of whom are said to have been corralled in internment camps in Beijing to staunch what China sees as Islamic radicalism. 

That contradiction was called out by Pompeo, who tweeted soon after the meeting that the ""world cannot afford China’s shameful hypocrisy toward Muslims. On one hand, China abuses more than a million Muslims at home, but on the other it protects violent Islamic terrorist groups from sanctions at the UN.""

According to human rights activists, at least a million Uighurs and minority Muslims are being held in internment camps in China’s Xinjiang region in an effort to “deradicalize” and “re-educate” them – a process that involves forcing them to drink alcohol and eat pork, and denying them access to the Quran. 

""Met with survivors and family members of China's campaign of repression and mass detention against #Uighurs, ethnic #Kazakhs, and other members of minority groups in #Xinjiang. I call on China to end these counterproductive policies and release all arbitrarily detained,"" Pompeo tweeted, without elaborating on China’s excesses.

He then added: ""China has detained more than one million #Uighurs, ethnic #Kazakhs, and other #Muslim minorities in internment camps in #Xinjiang since April 2017. The U.S. stands with them and their family members. China must release all those arbitrarily detained and end its repression.”

Pakistan, now regarded as China’s client state, has quietly swallowed Beijing crackdown on Muslims, ostensibly under an agreement that will protect its terrorist assets. Not bearing down too hard on terrorist principals in Pakistan also allows China to protect its own economic investments in Pakistan that would otherwise be threatened.

But the international community has begun to turn the heat on Pakistan after long years of passivity towards its use of terrorist proxies. On Thursday, Pakistan’s Dawn newspaper reported that a delegation of the Asia-Pacific Group (APG) on money laundering, a regional affiliate of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), ""expressed serious reservations over insufficient physical actions on ground against proscribed organisations (POs) to block flow of funds and activities and is likely to issue a formal warning before its departure on Thursday.""

'Serial offender, apologist': India makes veiled reference to Pakistan as UN moves against terror financing 

","
UNITED NATIONS: In a veiled reference to Pakistan, India said countries that are ""apologists for terrorists"" will continue to provide ""alibis"" justifying their actions and inaction, as it called on the Security Council to ensure crucial sanctions measures against the UN proscribed terrorists and entities are strictly enforced.


The Security Council on Thursday unanimously adopted a resolution calling upon Member States to step up efforts to combat and criminalise the financing of terrorists and their activities.

India welcomed the adoption of the resolution, describing it a ""milestone"" in global efforts to set up a normative framework to criminalise terrorist financing.

India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin, participating in the Security Council open debate on 'Preventing and Combating the Financing of Terrorism', said New Delhi specifically welcomes the recognition in the resolution of the essential role of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in setting global standards, especially in the context of preventing and combating money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing.

Akbaruddin, however, asserted that the Council ""can and needs"" to do a better job of overseeing the implementation of its resolutions relating to terrorist financing and of the various sanctions measures under the 1267 Al- Qaida and 1988 sanctions regimes.

India warned that ""non-compliance of crucial sanctions measures in case of the UN proscribed terrorists and entities renders all of us, Member States, at a high risk of facing challenges from these terrorist organisations who are well funded and armed despite international measures.""

""As the saying goes, the proof of the pudding is in its eating, the utility of any council resolution will, therefore, be in its implementation,"" he said.

""Also, the unfortunate reality is that States who are apologists for terrorists will continue to provide alibis to justify their actions and inaction too, as was done by a serial offender earlier today,"" he said, a veiled reference to Pakistan.

Pakistan's Ambassador to the UN Maleeha Lodhi, in her statement during that debate, said that it is important that the FATF and the 1267 sanctions regimes are ""not used as political tools by some to advance their geo-political objectives."" She also made a reference to Jammu and Kashmir in her statement.

Akbaruddin asserted that the international community needs to be determined to ""continue evolving our tool box and go by our rule book, rather than be distracted and stray from our determination. Our tool box consisting of effective implementation of UN sanctions measures could assist in curtailing these activities in some measure.""

Describing terrorism as a scourge that is tearing at the fabric of societies across the globe, Akbaruddin said it is a menace that is not quarantined to any region.

""People now live in fear of terrorist threats in countries across the world. Combating Terrorism is viewed by many States and their people as one of the most fundamental security policy priorities that require global responsiveness,"" he said, calling the adoption of the resolution an answer to ""a felt need.""

""The global community is impatient for action. The UN collectively needs to do more and do it much more effectively. For its part, India will be a willing partner in this endeavour,"" he said at the open debate convened by France under its Presidency of the Security Council for the month of March.

Akbaruddin further highlighted that many Council resolutions, including the various sanctions measures under the 1267 and 1988 sanctions regimes, where asset freeze is a core part of states' obligations call for regular reporting under these measures.

While welcoming the resolution's focus on ensuring full compliance with the measures imposed by the Security Council, Akbaruddin voiced concern that no effective action is taken on instances of reported non-compliance with the sanctions measures.

He pointed out that the report of the 1267 sanctions Monitoring team dated January 15, 2019 notes that Member States have reported to the Monitoring Team, on an ad hoc basis and a comprehensive review of frozen assets has not been undertaken. He expressed hope that there will action on this front by member states.

""We welcome the Council and its various bodies taking note and rectifying instances of non-implementation to enhance awareness and effective implementation of the various council resolutions on Counter Terrorism. We believe that this work could be strengthened with more cooperation between the FATF and the various UN entities…""

""Bodies such as the FATF have listed risks posed by Da'esh, Al- Qaida, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, Falah-i-Insaniyat Foundation, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Haqqani Network, and persons affiliated with the Taliban,"" he added.

By other terms of the resolution, all States shall — in a manner consistent with their obligations under international law — ensure that their laws and regulations make it possible to prosecute and penalise, as serious criminal offences, the provision or collection of funds, resources and services intended to be used for the benefit of terrorist organisations or individual terrorists.

The resolution also calls upon Member States to conduct financial investigations into terrorism-related cases and to more effectively investigate and prosecute cases of terrorist financing, applying criminal sanctions as appropriate.

Narendra Modi: Land, air or space, we had courage to do surgical strikes 

","
MEERUT/RUDRAPUR: In his first election address after the poll schedule was announced, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a scathing attack on the opposition by saying that 'if Congress is removed, poverty will disappear.' He also referred to the success of 'Mission Shakti', saying, ""It is this chowkidar's government that had the courage to conduct surgical strikes on land, in air as well as in space."" 


""For four generations, the Congress family has harped on their slogans of 'garibi hatao'. The family continued to grow but the poor remained poor. For 72 years, Congress has backstabbed the poor of this country but now I assure you that your chowkidar, your Prime Minister will not rest till poverty is truly alleviated from the country,"" Modi said at a rally in Meerut.

Coining a new acronym for the SP-BSP-RLD alliance, and terming it 'Sarab', PM Narendra Modi on Thursday said, ""Take 'sa' from Samajwadi Party, 'ra' from Rashtriya Lok Dal and 'b' from Bahujan Samaj Party, and see what you get? Shouldn't we rescue ourselves from sarab for our good health?"" He added that ""Behenji worked hard for over two decades to put opposition leaders into jail and now she has joined hands with them.""

The PM alleged that ""mahamilawat (grand adulteration) leaders are competing with each other as to who will become a hero in Pakistan."" ""They are all over Pakistani media. People are clapping for them. You tell me what does our nation want? A hero of India or of Pakistan?""

Referring to the opposition's demand for proof of the Balakot air strikes, the PM said, ""Kya humein saboot chahiye ya sapoot chahiye? Mere desh ke sapoot hi mere desh ke sabse bada saboot hai. Jo saboot maangte hain woh sapoot ko lalkaarte hain"" (Do we want evidence or do we want our soldiers who are the true children of our country and the biggest evidence? Those who are asking for evidence are challenging the true sons of the nation."")

Taking a dig at Rahul Gandhi - who had wished Modi ""Happy Theatre Day' after the latter's televised address on the success of Mission Shakti - the PM said, ""I do not know whether to laugh or to cry at those who thought I was speaking of a theatre set when I spoke of A-SAT (Anti-satellite missile). What do you say about a person who doesn't even know the difference between A-SAT and theatre set?"" 

Taking a jibe at the Congress's poll promise of transferring Rs 72,000 into the bank accounts of the poor every year, the PM said, ""Those people who could not open bank accounts for the poor in the last 70 years are promising direct transfer of money into their accounts."" 

In his next poll stop at Rudrapur in Udham Singh Nagar district of Uttarakhand, Modi resumed his tirade against Congress by alleging that the party was responsible for corruption, lack of development and migration from villages of Uttarakhand. The PM started his address by greeting the huge crowd that had gathered at the rally venue 'Modi Maidan' (named after the PM) in Kumaoni. Expressing his gratitude for the enormous gathering, he said that everyone who appeared in the rally was a 'Chowkidar'. He asked people to chant after him and complete the sentence, 'Main bhi........Chowkidar'. 

""Devbhomi Uttarakhand has Char Dhams, but today I add a fifth one - Sainik Dham as every second house in this state is that of an Army jawan,"" the PM said, adding that ""attempts are being made by the opposition parties to hurt the morale of defence forces.""

The PM also added that over 40,000 houses had been built under PM Awas Yojana in Uttarakhand and ""it is my responsibility to provide homes for the homeless."" ""I assure you there will be no homeless in India by 2022,"" said Modi.

Petition against Ahmed Patel's RS election: Voting video played in HC 

","
AHMEDABAD: A video recorded during the controversial voting for a 2017 Rajya Sabha seat election, in which Congress leader Ahmed Patel emerged victorious, was played at the Gujarat high court Thursday.


The court is hearing a petition filed by BJP leader Balvantsinh Rajput, the losing candidate, challenging Patel's election.

The video, submitted by the returning officer, was played in the court of Justice Bela Trivedi. It showed four MLAs casting their ballots on August 8, 2017.

The votes of two of them -- rebel Congress MLAs Raghavji Patel and Bholabhai Gohel -- were declared invalid by the Election Commission, while those of Congress MLAs Shailesh Patel and Mitesh Garasiya were counted, despite the BJP demanding that they should also be invalidated.

The decision led to Ahmed Patel's victory as he got 44 votes, the minimum he needed to win. Rajput polled 38.

Rajput has alleged that Patel won because of ""bribery"" and ""undue influence"". He has also challenged the EC's decision to invalidate the votes of two rebel Congress MLAs.

So far sixteen witnesses have deposed and have been cross-examined before the court.

A senior official of the Election Commission of India appeared Thursday as a seventeenth witness, but as he came without required documents, the court asked him to appear again Friday.

During the election, the Congress had lodged a complaint, saying that two rebel party MLAs showed their ballots to BJP representatives before putting them in the ballot box.

MLAs are not allowed to show their ballots to anybody other than the authorised polling agent of their own party. Both these MLAs had voted for Rajput.

As their votes were held invalid, Patel was declared winner.

US seeks to corner China with parallel resolution for Azhar ban 

","
NEW DELHI: Undeterred by China’s obdurate support to Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) leader Masood Azhar, the US has circulated a draft resolution at the UN for a ban on the Pakistan based terrorist. Unlike on previous occasions though, the resolution has been introduced in the UN Security Council and not in the 1267 sanctions committee of the Council.


This means that China, if it doesn’t lift the ""technical"" hold on the proposed ban on Azhar, will likely have to explain publicly for the first time the rationale behind its support to the leader of the UN-designated terrorist group. It is understood that the next step likely for the Council is to have informal discussions on the resolution.

However, if it fails to arrive at a consensus, then the Council could consider putting the resolution to vote leading to an open discussion on the issue. The US, France and UK, which have worked together to bring the proposal, will hope in such a scenario that China, fearing isolation, abstains to allow the ban to go through.

Never before has a terrorist of interest to India been targeted in this manner at the Council. All other 14 Members of the Council are said to be supporting the proposed ban.

China reacted to the development by accusing the US of ``forcefully'' introducing the resolution and ``undermining'' the UN anti-terror body. The Chinese foreign ministry said this wasn’t in line with resolution of the issue through ``dialogue and negotiations’’ and that it only complicated the issue.

China had only 2 weeks ago, for the 4th time, vetoed a proposal for proscribing of Azhar by the UN. It said it had put the resolution on a ``technical’’ hold even though the 1267 committee recognises no such thing as a technical hold. The previous resolutions though were in the 1267 committee and not in the Council which decides publicly. Unlike with the resolutions in the committee, China can’t just put on hold the resolution in the Council. It will have to discuss it as a Member and, if it comes to that, even vote on it with an explanation.

A Security Council diplomat had warned earlier this month that Council members could consider other options if China persisted with the hold. The US is hoping that this parallel process of circulating the resolution in the Council will force China to review its position on Azhar, whose presence in Pakistan has been under fresh global scrutiny since the February 14 Pulwama attack. JeM had claimed responsibility for the attack.

For India, the latest step helps expedite the process of listing Azhar as a global terrorist as the hold on the proposed ban in the 1267 committee can last up to 9 months.

Official sources here said that it will not be appropriate for India to comment at this stage on a process which was entirely within the parameters of informal discussion of the Council and its Members.

``We are aware that a draft has been initiated for consideration of Council members to list Masood Azhar in the sanctions regime as part of international community's efforts to fight against terrorism,’’ said a source.

``Our views on Masood Azhar, the founder-leader of the JeM which has claimed responsibility for numerous terrorist attacks on our citizens including the heinous attack on our paramilitary force personnel in Pulwama on February 14th are well known,’’ he added.

Mamata Banerjee: Priyanka Gandhi’s 2022 quip triggers talk on Congress strategy 

","
AMETHI/RAE BARELI: During a late-night meeting in Amethi on Wednesday, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra urged party workers to keep up the poll momentum till 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. ""Tayyari kar rahe ho aap chunaav ki? Iss wale ki nahi, 2022 ke liye…"" (Are you working for the party's victory in the 2022 elections?),"" she said.


Priyanka's remarks followed demands to field the son of late Congress MLA Noor Mohammad from the Gauriganj assembly seat. ""Please keep the honour of my brother. We always defended you Didi. Please keep your promise,"" pleaded a relative of Noor.

Her comment triggered speculation about whether Congress was strategically going for a direct fight with regional powers SP and BSP in 2019 to dig its heels in for the longer battle for 2022 or keep a limited focus on under-30 seats this time.

Priyanka held back-to-back meetings with boothlevel workers in Rae Bareli. At a public meeting, she said she deliberately stayed away from Amethi and Rae Bareli in the last five years as she sought full responsibility. ""I stayed away from Amethi and Rae Bareli because I don't like half measures. I thought I will be fully active when I get total responsibility,"" Priyanka told workers.

Political rivals, however, launched a poster campaign against Priyanka for showing up in Rae Bareli only on the eve of elections.

Priyanka Gandhi: Should I fight from Varanasi, Priyanka Gandhi asks party workers 

","
NEW DELHI: It was a stock query for 

  Priyanka Gandhi Vadra
 + , but one that elicited an unexpected answer. ""Varanasi se lad lun (should I contest from Varanasi?)"" - Priyanka's response to a party worker's query at a meeting in Rae Bareli on Thursday immediately set off fevered political speculation.


The comment is being interpreted in various ways. It could be mere repartee devoid of any deeper intent or could reveal a desire to take the electoral plunge. After all, it came a day after she answered the same question, saying that if the party felt so, she would be all too 

  happy to contest the election
 + .

The brief remark was enough to set a buzz and get the media interested, given that the temple town of Varanasi is the constituency of PM Narendra Modi.

According to reports, the comment came at a Congress workers' meeting in Rae Bareli fromn where Sonia Gandhi is to contest once again, with a group insisting that Priyanka fight the polls. The implied suggestion, a party source said, could be that she could step into her mother's shoes.

However, they were in for a shock when Priyanka turned back and asked how if she contested from Varanasi. While making it clear that she was open to contesting, she has also made it a point to add that her personal wish was to work for the party organisation as a lot of work had to be done.

Ever since Priyanka took the political plunge in January, the latest Gandhi to do so, there has been speculation if she would also make an electoral debut. With Sonia running again from her constituency and brother Rahul in Amethi, the possibility of her going to Varanasi ""to tie down the PM to his seat"" has been doing the rounds in party circles.

Priyanka's own allusion to Varanasi is set to stoke this speculation which, given its sensational implication, may set the political campaign abuzz. As the news spread, a party sympathiser claimed that even in 2014, Priyanka had toyed with the idea of taking on Modi, BJP's then prime ministerial nominee. However, the plan was shelved.

Given the charge of rejuvenating Congress in Uttar Pradesh, Priyanka is on a tour of the family turf of Amethi and Rae Bareli. She will visit Ayodhya on Friday before returning to the capital.

Mamata charges BJP with using Lord Ram's name to win polls 

","
KOLKATA: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday accused the BJP of playing the religion card and using Lord Ram's name to win elections, though it failed to build the Ram Mandir at Ayodhya.


Banerjee, also the Trinamool Congress supremo, said she never used religion to win polls but respects all irrespective of their faith or caste.

""You (the BJP) use religion for elections. You contest elections using the name of (Lord) Ram but could not build one Ram Mandir in five years,"" she said while addressing a programme organised by the Marwari community here.

""We do not use religion to win elections. We are with everybody - Ram or Rahim, Sikh or Christian,"" Banerjee said.

Referring to the Income Tax notices sent to about 40 big-budget Durga Puja committees in the city, she said no community was obstructed in holding religions celebrations in West Bengal.

The chief minister claimed that people from other states like UP or Bihar feel ""safer"" in West Bengal compared to their home states.

She said the GST would be reviewed and demonetisation would be probed if the opposition alliance comes to power after the general elections.

""They made a GST that destroyed businesses of all sorts. We will review it and surely initiate an enquiry into demonetisation,"" Banerjee said.

Britain's May seeks third Brexit vote on Friday - Times of India

","
LONDON: The British government said it intended to bring back Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal for a third vote in parliament on Friday to avoid a chaotic no-deal divorce from the EU.


May's throw of the dice comes a day after her dramatic pledge to resign in order to persuade her rivals to finally back her vision for breaking Britain's 46-year bond with the European project.

The government's back is against the wall as it tries to avert potential economic disaster and financial panic in the coming weeks.

The House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said the government was trying to secure permission for a third vote from parliament speaker John Bercow.

He already rejected a similar attempt last week after ruling that the version May was bringing back was essentially the same text that lawmakers had already twice rejected by resounding margins.

""We recognise that any motion brought forward tomorrow will need to be compliant with the speaker's ruling and that discussion is ongoing,"" Leadsom told the chamber.

Anxious EU leaders last week offered Britain a Brexit extension until May 22.

But it is conditional on parliament voting through May's deal by Friday — the day Britain was originally scheduled to leave.

Failure to pass the deal could mean a no-deal Brexit as early as April 12. Businesses fear that will cause economic chaos.

To avoid that, the British government must spell out what its next steps should be.

Britain might then seek a much longer extension that would mean it has to hold European Parliament elections despite having voted to leave the bloc.

May's handling of Brexit has provoked both anger and frustration as well as ridicule.

She played what may have been her last political card on Wednesday by promising to quit once the messy divorce process is complete.

""I know there is a desire for a new approach — and new leadership — in the second phase of the Brexit negotiations and I won't stand in the way of that,"" May told a packed meeting of party members.

Her promise won over some likely contenders for her job.

May became premier shortly after the 2016 referendum in which Britons narrowly voted to leave the EU.

Former foreign minister Boris Johnson said he would now back the premier ""on behalf of the 17.4 million people who voted for Brexit"".

But the prime minister's position was undermined when her allies in Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said they would continue to oppose the deal.

The small party props up May's minority government, giving it a decisive role in the political saga that has consumed Britain and left its EU partners increasingly perplexed.

The DUP is opposed to provisions in May's deal to keep a free-flowing border between Britain's Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.

The group worries that this would give Northern Ireland a different economic status from mainland Britain and separate it from the mainland.

""For us, the most important thing is a union,"" DUP leader Arlene Foster told RTE television Friday.

""I don't make any apologies for that.""

Downing Street said Thursday that ""discussions with the DUP are continuing"" as the government tries to piece together a majority from a patchwork of conflicting interests.

Parliament has failed to rally round any new last-minute Brexit proposal.

Parliament took the unprecedented step of assigning itself the right to vote on a multiple choice of alternate solutions to the deal May reached with Brussels after 17 months of talks.

But none of the eight options secured a majority and another vote has been set for Monday on some of the proposals.

The one that came closest to winning parliamentary support provided for a much closer economic union with the other 27 nations post-Brexit than the one the Conservative party platform allows.

A proposal to hold a second referendum — a popular idea with EU supporters — came second while those promoting a cleaner break finished near the bottom.

Masood Azhar: US, China in bitter showdown at UN over sanctions on Masood Azhar 

","
The US and China seem headed for a showdown at the UN over Jaish chief Masood Azhar with Beijing accusing Washington of ""forcefully moving"" a resolution in the Security Council intended to compel China to make public its reasons for stalling efforts to tag him as a ""global terrorist"".


With Beijing persisting with a ""technical hold"", preventing the sanctions committee of the UNSC from designating the Jaish-e-Muhammed chief as a terrorist, Washington has sought to raise the heat by seeking a discussion in the council - inviting a sharp Chinese retort that it should act with caution.

Acting with the support of France and the UK, the US bumped up the issue of listing Azhar on Wednesday.



China draws ire of other UNSC members for saving Jaish chief Masood AzharA day after Beijing used its veto to stall the sanctions committee’s near-unanimous decision to designate Azhar a terrorist, a Security Council diplomat said China should not prevent the UN panel from doing its job, and Beijing’s move to hold the listing was ""inconsistent with its own stated goals of combating terrorism and furthering regional stability in South Asia.""


The move came two weeks after China, for the fourth time, put a hold on a proposal to list him under the 1267 Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee of the council.

Never before has a terrorist of interest to India been targeted at the council in this manner. The other 14 members of the council are said to be supporting the proposed ban. 

Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said in Beijing that the 

  US was undermining the authority of the sanctions committee
 + . ""This is not in line with resolution of the issue through dialogue and negotiations. This has reduced the authority of the committee as a main anti-terrorism body of the UNSC and this is not conducive to the solidarity and only complicates the issue,"" Geng said.

""We urge the US to act cautiously and avoid forcefully moving forward this resolution draft,"" China said, using unusually blunt language as the Trump administration made good its expressed intent to take the JeM chief's issue to the UNSC since the sanctions committee had been repeatedly thwarted.

Adding to the friction was US secretary of state Mike Pompeo calling out the contradiction of China's forcible detention of Uighur Muslims while supporting terror groups like JeM. ""The world cannot afford China's shameful hypocrisy toward Muslims. On one hand, China abuses more than a million Muslims at home, but on the other, it protects violent Islamic terrorist groups from sanctions at the UN,"" Pompeo said.

The US resolve in pushing China reflects a determination to press down on Pakistan in the wake of the JeM claiming responsibility for the suicide bombing in Pulwama despite its efforts to withdraw from Afghanistan, a strategy that is seen to require the cooperation of Pakistan. Its cruciality to US plans is seen as a factor that emboldens the Pakistan military to ""sanction"" a big attack in J&K.

The US move means that China, if it doesn't lift the ""technical hold"", will likely have to explain publicly for the first time the rationale behind its support to the leader of a UN-designated terrorist group. It is understood that the next step for the council is to have informal discussions on the resolution.

Though China as a permanent member can veto the draft resolution in the UNSC, the development further isolates Beijing at a time when the international community is running out of patience with Pakistan's sponsorship of terrorism and China's decision to shield it. JeM's claim for the Pulwama attack only deepened the unease. Proceedings of the sanctions committee were in camera but a UNSC vote, if it comes to that, will be on record.

The US-China clash over Azhar came against the backdrop of Pompeo meeting a delegation of Uighur Muslims, tens of thousands of whom are said to have been corralled in internment camps as Beijing tries to staunch what it sees as Islamic radicalism.

If the council fails to arrive at a consensus, then it could consider putting the resolution to vote, leading to an open discussion. The US, France and the UK, which have worked together to bring the proposal, will hope in such a scenario that China, fearing isolation, abstains to allow the ban to go through.

Iceland's WOW Air budget carrier collapses, cancels all flights - Times of India

","
REYKJAVIK: Iceland's budget carrier WOW Air said it had ceased operations and cancelled all flights on Thursday, stranding thousands of passengers.


The collapse of the troubled airline, which transports more than a third of those travelling to Iceland, comes after buyout talks with rival Icelandair collapsed earlier this week.

""All WOW Air flights have been cancelled. Passengers are advised to check available flights with other airlines,"" the carrier said in a statement.

""Some airlines may offer flights at a reduced rate, so-called rescue fares, in light of the circumstances. Information on those airlines will be published, when it becomes available.""

Iceland's government said it estimated that 4,000 travellers were stranded, including around 1,300 currently in transit.

At Reykjavik airport, hundreds of passengers were stranded as 30 WOW Air flights to Paris, New York, Montreal were cancelled.

Two Portuguese tourists, Cristiana and Nuno Barrocas, were in Iceland as part of a trip around the world and rushed to the airport after hearing the news.

""Our dream is to go around the world but the start of our adventure is turning out worse than expected,"" the couple told AFP after their flight from Copenhagen to Reykjavik was delayed on Wednesday.

A 28-year-old Canadian university exchange student in Belgium, Charles Ouellet, was due to fly home to Montreal on a WOW flight via Reykjavik on April 3.

""I'm going to see if I can get refunded,"" he told AFP.

WOW Air, founded in 2011, exploited Iceland's location in the middle of the North Atlantic to offer a low-cost service between Europe and North America as well as tapping into a tourist boom to the volcanic island.

However it had flown into financial trouble in recent years due to heightened competition on transatlantic low-cost flights and rising fuel prices, and had been searching for an investor for months.

On Monday WOW Air said it was in talks to restructure its debt with its creditors after Icelandair ended brief negotiations over buying a stake in the no-frills airline. WOW Air was left needing $42 million to save the company, according to the Frettabladid newspaper.

The privately-owned airline has undergone major restructuring after posting a pre-tax loss of almost $42 million for the first nine months of 2018.

It has reduced its fleet from 20 to 11 aircraft, eliminating several destinations, including those to the US, and cutting 111 full-time jobs.

A report by a governmental work group has warned that a WOW Air bankruptcy would lead to a drop in Iceland's gross domestic product, a drop in the value of the krona and rising inflation.

In 2018, WOW Air, which employs 1,000 people, transported 3.5 million passengers.

End of an 'era': Emperor's exit resets Japan calendar - Times of India

","
TOKYO: The abdication of Japan's Emperor Akihito on April 30 will quite literally mark the end of an era, the Heisei era of his rule, and highly secretive talks have been going on for months on what to call the next one.


This is anything but a procedural issue, as the name of the era has a tangible effect on the daily lives of the Japanese as well as a psychological impact on the nation.

Japan is the only country in the world still using Chinese-style imperial calendars. It might be 2019 in much of the world, but in Japan it is Heisei 31, or the 31st year of Akihito's reign.

While the Gregorian calendar is also widely used in Japan, imperial dates feature on government documents, newspapers, and commercial calendars.

""It is easier to imagine what the time was like if you have eras,"" said Kunio Kowaguchi, president of major calendar maker Todan.

""For instance, we remember it was early Heisei that the bubble burst,"" he told AFP, referring to the collapse of Japan's speculation-driven economy.

The upcoming end of the Heisei period was even reportedly a factor in the government's decision to implement death sentences last year against 13 members of the Aum cult behind a 1995 sarin attack.

Government officials apparently wanted to a draw a line under the cult's attacks before the Heisei era ends. All 13 executions were carried out in July.

Japan has had nearly 250 eras since adopting the system in the 7th century.

In the past, emperors would switch era names mid-reign to mark a fresh start after natural disasters or crises.

But more recently, an era has run the entire length of a monarch's rule.

Crown Prince Naruhito ascends the Chrysanthemum Throne on May 1. His era name will be announced at 11:30am on Monday -- a month ahead of the ceremony.

And speculation over what the name might be has been rife.

There have been more than 10,000 entries in a public guessing competition run by a liquor company, hoping to win a vintage bottle of sake from year one of the Heisei era (1989).

A new era is a real challenge for companies like Kowaguchi's, which produces 10 million calendars a year, many featuring both Western and imperial dates.

Printing begins a year before release, so it was too late for his 2019 run to feature the new name.

The new imperial era will be the first since the IT revolution, and the tech sector is girding for the transition.

It has inspired comparisons to the ""Y2K"" bug ahead of the year 2000, when experts worried about a tech apocalypse fearing that computers would not understand the new date.

""What is largely different from the time of the Y2K problem or the switch to the Heisei period is that IT is widely used and information is passed around among internet-capable devices,"" said Kazunori Ishii, spokesman at Microsoft's Japan arm.

""We can't predict exactly what will happen,"" he said, though he noted that major disruption was ""unlikely"".

Software used in Japan that converts between Western and imperial dates will need to be updated with the new era, and code and fonts for the new name will also need to be created.

The 85-year-old emperor's decision to abdicate gave experts a rare head start in choosing the new era's name.

The task falls to the government rather than the palace and, like many matters involving the royal household, is shrouded in secrecy.

There are stringent guidelines requiring the name to have two characters, be easy to read and write, and not use common names.

The new name is also unlikely to start with the first letter of any of the last four eras: Heisei, Showa, Taisho and Meiji.

And because each era name is considered ""sacred"", any name put forward but rejected in the past cannot be proposed again.

One of the few people familiar with the challenge is Junzo Matoba, a former bureaucrat who helped look for new names during the last years of emperor Hirohito's Showa era, in the late 1980s.

""Some people thought it was irreverent to think about the next era"" while the emperor was still alive, he told AFP.

""I had to work secretly.""

He consulted academics on Asian history and literature while trying to maintain a low profile.

""I found myself caught up in such a difficult task -- I was sitting under the Sword of Damocles,"" the 83-year-old told AFP last year.

Japan's government is believed to have a shortlist of names, but has been mum on potential choices.

The government does not even disclose the names of scholars asked to put up candidate names.

A nine-member panel is to make a pick out of the candidates. Parliament leaders' opinions will be heard on it and then cabinet ministers will meet to give the final go-ahead.

""Japanese people love to 'reset' things,"" said Matoba.

""A new era, a new mindset.

China slams US criticism of Muslim treatment as 'absurd' - Times of India

","
BEIJING: China on Thursday hit back at criticism from the United States' top diplomat who called its treatment of Muslims ""shameful hypocrisy"" after speaking with a former prisoner from a Chinese detention camp.


US secretary of state Mike Pompeo made the comment after meeting with Mihrigul Tursun, a member of the Uighur ethnic group who has spoken publicly in the US about what she said was widespread torture in China's prisons for the minority group.

Beijing claims the camps are ""vocational training centres"" that provide language classes and employment, steering locals away from extremism.

Pompeo's comments are ""extremely absurd and grossly interfere in China's internal affairs,"" said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang at a regular press briefing.

""Currently, the overall situation in Xinjiang society is stable ... and all ethnic groups get along harmoniously,"" he said.

""We urge the US to respect the facts ... and stop the malicious smearing and groundless accusations against the Chinese side,"" Geng added.

As many as one million Uighurs and other mostly Muslim minorities are being held in internment camps in Xinjiang, according to a group of experts cited last year by the United Nations.

Former detainees say they were detained for simply following Islamic traditions, such as having a long beard or wearing a veil.

""China must release all those arbitrarily detained and end its repression,"" tweeted Pompeo, who had also met with relatives of those detained in Xinjiang.

After months denying the existence of the internment camps, Beijing last year launched a public relations campaign to defend its ""training centres"", organising visits for diplomats and media from friendly countries.

However, a delegation of three EU officials who visited Xinjiang in January as part of a carefully organised visit said they had the impression that the people they had spoken to in a ""training centre"" were reciting a dictated speech.

On Wednesday, Pompeo also criticised Beijing's trillion-dollar Belt and Road project after Italy decided to join China's ""Silk Road"" infrastructure initiative.

He accused China of practising ""debt-trap diplomacy"" with its state-owned or state-controlled enterprises only looking after their own interests.

""The US side's statement is inconsistent with the facts,"" dismissed Geng. ""No country sinks into a so-called debt trap because of their co-operation with China.""

Brexit in dates: Third time lucky for May's deal? - Times of India

","
From the shock Brexit referendum result to Friday's make-or-break vote on the EU divorce deal, here are the milestones on the UK's rocky road out of the European Union after 46 years.


In a referendum on June 23, 2016, Britons choose to end their membership of the 28-nation EU by a narrow 52 percent to 48 percent.

Conservative prime minister David Cameron, who called the referendum and led the remain campaign, resigns.

Theresa May, the remain-backing interior minister, becomes prime minister on July 13.

On January 17, 2017, May sets out her Brexit strategy, saying Britain will leave Europe's single market to allow it to control EU immigration.

""No deal for Britain is better than a bad deal,"" she insists.

On March 13, 2017, Britain's parliament approves a bill empowering May to trigger Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty which lays out the process for leaving the union.

With a letter to EU President Donald Tusk formally announcing Britain's intention to leave, the government starts a two-year timetable for withdrawal on March 29, 2019.

In a bid to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations, May calls a snap election for June 8, 2017.

Her gamble backfires, with her Conservatives losing their parliamentary majority. They are forced to strike a deal for support from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.

On July 6, 2018, May wins agreement from her warring cabinet to pursue ""a UK-EU free trade area"" and strong alignment with the EU after Brexit.

Two days later, eurosceptic Brexit minister David Davis quits, saying May is giving ""too much away too easily"". Foreign minister Boris Johnson follows suit on July 9.

In November, May's office says negotiators have reached a draft divorce agreement with the EU, which her cabinet backs after hours of heated debate.

But four ministers, including new Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, resign.

EU leaders approve the accord within a few weeks. ""This is the only deal possible,"" says European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.

May's deal faces intense criticism in parliament over the ""backstop"" provision to prevent checks on the Irish border.

On December 10, May postpones a parliament vote on the deal due the following day, fearing a heavy defeat, but EU leaders reject substantive renegotiation.

On December 12, enough Conservative MPs are unhappy with May's party leadership to trigger a confidence vote, but she wins by 200 to 117.

Parliament finally votes on the withdrawal agreement on January 15.

With opposition parties and scores of Conservatives opposing it for various reasons, MPs vote by 432 to 202 against the deal -- the worst defeat for a government in modern British political history.

Main opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn calls a vote of no confidence in the government on January 16.

The government wins by 325 to 306 votes, as May's Conservatives rally round. She pledges to work with opposition leaders to find a Brexit breakthrough.

On March 12, British MPs vote 391-242 against May's deal for a second time, even after May and EU leaders say they have agreed ""legally binding changes"" to its most contentious points.

MPs on March 14 vote to ask the EU to delay Brexit until at least June and to hold a third vote on May's plan early next week.

In an dramatic meeting with fellow Conservatives on March 27, May promises to resign if her main leadership rivals support her deal and help it over the line.

Johnson, the former foreign minister, backs her, as does arch-eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg. May sets a third vote on her deal for Friday.

Fire breaks out in 22-storey building in Bangladesh - Times of India

","
DHAKA: Several people were feared trapped in a 22-storey building which caught fire in Bangladeshi capital's Banani area on Thursday, according to media reports.


The incident happened on Thursday afternoon in the building that houses several garment shops and internet service providers. Several people are feared trapped inside the building.

""The fire broke out at FR Tower around 12.52 pm on Thursday,""Ataur Rahman, an officer of the Dhaka fire service central control room, was quoted as saying by the Dhaka Tribune.

He said that 17 fire tenders have been sent to the spot to douse the blaze.

""Seventeen firefighting units of the Dhaka fire service and civil defence are trying to douse the fire,"" he said .

Last month at least 70 people were killed and over 50 injured when a fast-moving fire swept through an apartment buildings and chemical warehouses in Dhaka's congested Chawkbazar area.

Plans to return or migrate elsewhere emerge for over 80,000 Indian families in US - Times of India

","
The American Dream is fast turning into a nightmare for nearly 80,000 plus families from India, where a spouse is currently holding an employment authorisation document (EAD). This programme, that enabled spouses of certain category of H-1B visa holders, to work, is expected to end in the coming months.


Many families have kept ready a plan B - typically it entails a return back home or migration to another country. Some spouses will even try to convert their dependant H-4 visa, into a H-1B work visa, even as this task has its own challenges.

Spouses of H-1B workers are given an H-4 visa. Only in those cases where the H-1B visa recipient is on track for a green card, can the H-4 spouse apply for an EAD.




With a green card backlog running into several decades for Indians, an EAD opened the doors for employment (including self-employment). It meant more than financial freedom, as the work authorisation also enabled spouses to obtain a social security number, open a bank account and get a driving license.

A 29-year-old, HR specialist, who moved to US in 2015 (post her marriage) and is currently working in large tech company headquartered in Menlo Park, California says: ""I moved knowing that the EAD option was available. Else I would have forced my spouse to look at other options, at the outset itself.""

American Immigration Council, a not-for-profit body points out: ""The highly-skilled individuals that US employers hope to attract and employ on a H-1B visa often have a spouse or family to consider. If the spouse retains the option of being employed, the US employer can provide a more appealing and competitive job offer.""

 ""My field is non-STEM; hence it is extremely difficult to get an H-1B sponsorship. This doesn't make me less skilled or talented. I worked hard to get an MBA seat. I've also done a specialised HR certification in US,"" she adds. Given the uncertainty, she and her husband have put on hold purchase of a house in US, instead they are concentrating on obtaining a Canadian permanent residency as a backup option.

Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris is one of the several senators who has vowed to fight against revocation of EAD. Her tweet: ""This is outrageous and will force immigrant women who are doctors, nurses, scientists and academics among others to abandon their professional careers,"" squarely covers Dr Shilpa's predicament. 

Thirty-four years old and a dentist by profession, Shilpa (last name withheld on request), post her marriage moved to the US in 2012. She pursued further studies, as the EAD program was introduced only in 2015 by the Obama administration.

She obtained her EAD in 2016, but took some time off to look after her family and is now hunting for career opportunities. ""No employer wants to deal with the mess that these policy changes are creating. Getting a job has become difficult. If things don't work out, returning to India appears to be a wise option,"" she says.

Revocation of EAD will also harm the US economy, say some experts. A recent report by American Action Forum, a policy think tank, which has used the community survey (aka census) data, estimates that H-4 workers are more highly educated and have higher earning on average than the overall U.S. working population. Currently, they contribute an estimated $12.9 billion annually to the U.S. economy. If every eligible H-4 visa holder were to obtain work authorisation, their economic contributions could increase to roughly $41 billion per year.

Saveh4EAD, a group that started in December 2017, which currently has an outreach of 7000 plus via Facebook, had conducted a survey (sample size around 2400), which found that 59% of the respondents had a postgraduate or professional degree. Nearly 57% of them were in US for more than 5 years, 60% paid taxes of more than $ 5,000 and 58% of them had US born children.

EAD holders who are entrepreneurs also directly create jobs for Americans. Akhila Tadinada, a 34 year old, having a masters in electrical engineering, has been mired in the green card backlog for the past nine years. She has worked in the technology sector for close to a decade with an H-1B visa. In 2018, she obtained an EAD and set up her own company. ""My startup 'Xemelgo' builds solutions for the American manufacturing sector. If I lose my EAD, the company may need to shut, this will impact jobs for several people,"" says Tadinada. If this happens, she has kept open the option of moving back to the job market and finding an employer who will sponsor her for an H-1B.

The draft for rescinding the EAD program is under review by the Office of Management and Budget. Once released, in the coming weeks, public comments will be invited prior to finalisation. EAD holders are grouping together, such as via the Saveh4EAD group, to make their voice heard.

Death toll from Dhaka tower fire jumps to 17: Official - Times of India

","
DHAKA: A huge fire in a Dhaka office block has killed at least 17 people, an official said Thursday, with desperate workers leaping to their deaths in the latest major inferno to hit the Bangladeshi capital.

""The death toll has risen to 17,"" Khurshid Alam, a fire service officer, told AFP, adding the toll may continue to rise as rescue crews search the torched building.


While several were still feared trapped inside the building, the officials confirmed the death of four people and said that they succumbed to the injuries while they jumped off the building for safety, the Dhaka Tribune reported.

""One person, a man yet to be identified by the authorities, was declared dead at Kurmitola General Hospital,"" Kazi Shahan Haque, the officer-in-charge of Cantonment police station, confirmed and said the victim fell off the building while trying to escape the fire.

"" Similarly, three more male victims were declared dead on arrival by the doctors of United Hospital,"" Sazzadur Rahman Shuvo, a senior executive of the hospital, was quoted as saying by the paper after he confirmed the deaths.

Apart from 21 fire tenders, Bangladesh Air Force helicopters and Navy commandos have been sent to the spot to douse the blaze.

The people who lost the life were among half a dozen people who jumped off from various floors of the high-rise for safety, resulting in grave injuries, senior officials at the spot said.

While the actual reason behind the blaze was not known, eye witnesses and a government officer at the spot said that the fire broke out on the eight floor of the building and later spread to the other parts.

However, fire service did not comment on what caused the fire.

""Three units of Bangladesh Navy are working to tame the blaze. We have brought around 50 per cent of the fire under control,""Siraj, a Navy officer, said.

Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director Abdullah Ibn Zaid said that three Bangladesh Air Force helicopters are aiding the search and rescue operations, along with teams from the Bangladesh Army and Navy.

""Many have taken shelter on the roof and some are asking for rescue through windows,” he said.

Several people have already been rescued from the burning building, officials said.

Last month at least 70 people were killed and over 50 injured when a fast-moving fire swept through an apartment buildings and chemical warehouses in Dhaka's congested Chawkbazar area.

Austrian far-right activist probed over ties to NZ suspect - Times of India

","
BERLIN: Austrian authorities have searched the home of a prominent far-right activist as part of a probe into his ties to the alleged Christchurch mosque gunman, officials said Tuesday.



Martin Sellner, head of the white nationalist group Identitarian Movement of Austria, said on social media that police searched his apartment Monday and seized electronic devices after he received a ""disproportionately high donation"" from a person named Tarrant - the same surname as the suspected Christchurch shooter.

Christoph Poelzl, spokesman for Austria's interior ministry, confirmed Tuesday that the country's BVT domestic intelligence agency searched the premises in Vienna at the request of prosecutors in the city of Graz.

Hansjoerg Bacher, a spokesman for Graz prosecutors, said prosecutors had stumbled across the donation as part of an existing probe against Sellner into possible financial offenses.

""The purpose of the investigation is to examine links between Mr. Sellner and the Christchurch attacker,"" Bacher told The Associated Press.

He declined to confirm when the donation took place, but said it was much higher than other contributions made to Sellner or his Identitarian Movement.

""Most donations were in the area of two-to-three figures, whereas this donation was in the low four-figure area,"" Bacher told The AP. ""This made it stand out, and the events in New Zealand put a face to this donation.""

He said the investigation against Sellner is based on Austrian anti-terror laws.

""We need to determine whether there is a connection and if so, whether it's criminally significant,"" said Bacher.

Sellner denied having anything to do with the March 15 massacre, in which 50 Muslims were killed in the southern New Zealand city.

Australian Brenton Tarrant was arrested within an hour of the mosque shootings and has been charged with murder.

""I had nothing to do with the attack,"" Sellner said in a video statement posted on YouTube, adding that he would donate the money to a charitable organization.

He suggested the reason for the donation might have been to provoke repressive measures against ``patriots.''

Austrian authorities said last week that the Christchurch shooter visited Austria, but declined to confirm when or whether he met with any far-right activists during his trip.

Some of Tarrant's anti-Muslim views are echoed by the Identitarian Movement. The group is close to sections of the nationalist Freedom Party, which is part of the country's coalition government.

Rare albino penguin makes debut at Polish zoo - Times of India

","
WARSAW: A rare three-month-old albino penguin made its first public appearance at a zoo in the Polish Baltic port city of Gdansk, where its keepers claim it is the only one of its kind in captivity. The all-white African black-foot penguin was born on December 14, but zoo staff decided to keep its arrival secret as they were unsure the vulnerable newborn would survive. 



Zoo staff are waiting until they are able to determine its sex to name the youngster. 

""As far as we know, there is no other such specimen alive (in captivity) in the world,"" Michal Targowski, director of the Gdansk Zoo, told the TVN24 commercial news channel. 

""The baby is active, in good health, eats well and, what's very important, its parents are taking very good care of it,"" Targowski said. 

To ensure its safety, the youngster is being kept with a small group of six adults, including its parents, part of a group of 70 penguins living at the Gdansk Zoo. 

""We're really doting on him so that nothing bad happens to him,"" Targowski, explaining that other penguins in the troop could take exception to the baby's unique look and harm it. 

African black-footed penguins, also known as jackass penguins due to their braying noise, have been rated as endangered since 2010 after suffering from commercial fishing, shortage of prey and pollution. (AFP) NSD NSD

Syria requests urgent UN Security Council meeting on Golan Heights - Times of India

","
UNITED STATES: Syria asked the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday to hold an urgent meeting on the US decision to recognize the Golan Heights as Israeli territory.


President Donald Trump signed a proclamation on Monday in which the United States recognized Israel's annexation of the strategic plateau, despite UN resolutions that call for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan.

In a letter seen by AFP, the Syrian mission to the United Nations asked the council presidency, held by France, to schedule an urgent meeting to ""discuss the situation in the occupied Syrian Golan and the recent flagrant violation of the relevant Security Council's resolution by a permanent member-state.""

The French presidency did not immediately schedule the meeting and diplomats said there would be a discussion at the council about the request.

On Friday, Syria wrote a separate letter urging the council to uphold resolutions demanding that Israel withdraw from the Golan.

The council is scheduled to discuss the latest crisis on Wednesday during a meeting on renewing the mandate of the UN peacekeeping force deployed between Israel and Syria in the Golan, known as UNDOF.

The head of the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, a key Syrian ally, called for resistance against the US decision.

Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said the only option left to Syrians to take back their land - and for Palestinians to achieve their ""legitimate rights"" - was ""resistance, resistance, and resistance.""

He described Trump's move as ""a crucial turning point in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict.""

Trump's decision ""deals a knockout punch to what is called the peace process in the region, which is built on (the concept of) land in exchange for peace"", he said in a televised address.

He called on the Arab League, which has suspended Syria's membership over the bloody repression of protests leading to the war, to take action at a summit at the end of the month in Tunis.

Five European countries with seats on the council earlier rejected Trump's decision and voiced concern that the US move would have broad consequences in the Middle East.

Two of Washington's closest allies - Britain and France - joined Belgium, Germany and Poland to declare that the European position had not changed and that the Golan remained Israeli-occupied Syrian territory, in line with international law enshrined in UN resolutions.

Three UN Security Council resolutions call on Israel to withdraw from the Golan, which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War and annexed in 1981, in a move that was never recognized internationally.

US acting ambassador Jonathan Cohen told a council meeting on the Middle East that Washington had made the decision to stand up to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Iran.

""To allow the Golan Heights to be controlled by the likes of the Syrian and Iranian regimes would turn a blind eye to the atrocities of the Assad regime and malign and destabilizing presence of Iran in the region,"" said Cohen.

There ""can be no peace agreement that does not satisfactorily address Israel's security needs in the Golan Heights,"" he added.

China and Russia spoke out against the US decision during the council meeting, as did Indonesia and South Africa, two countries that strongly support the Palestinians, along with Kuwait, a US ally in the region.

PM Theresa May makes final push on EU divorce deal, vote likely today - Times of India

","
LONDON: British PM Theresa May made a final push on Thursday to save her European Union withdrawal agreement after her promise to step down gained the deal some support but failed to win over lawmakers from Northern Ireland.


The government announced there would be a previously unscheduled Brexit debate in Parliament on Friday - but did not confirm whether it would include a new vote on May's twice-rejected EU divorce agreement. The EU has said the PM must secure approval for her deal by 11pm (UK time) on Friday if the UK is to be given an automatic delay of its departure date from the bloc until May 22.

Otherwise, Britain has until April 12 to announce a new plan, or leave the bloc without a deal. Announcing Friday's debate, House of Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom did not say whether it would include a vote on May's deal. Commons Speaker John Bercow has said the government can't bring the rejected deal back a third time unless it has been changed.

May pledged on Wednesday that she would resign if her Brexit deal was approved, in hopes of blunting opposition from those who have criticised her leadership.

‘Fake’ Botticelli turns out to be real - Times of India

","
LONDON: Experts have discovered that a Botticelli painting believed to be fake is in fact a rare original produced by the artist’s own workshop, after removing more than a century’s worth of yellow varnish.


The artwork was believed to be an imitation of the Renaissance painter’s famous ‘Madonna of the Pomegranate’ due to the varnish and substantial areas of overpainting, which led to fears that it was a poor-quality copy.

However, X-ray testing, infrared studies and pigment analysis revealed that the painting, which boasts vivid reds, blues and golds, was created at Botticelli’s workshop in Florence during the 15th century.

English Heritage’s senior collections conservator Rachel Turnbull said after consulting with experts at the Victoria & Albert Museum and the National Gallery, they were “finally able to confirm” that the ‘Madonna of the Pomegranate’ painting was by Botticelli.

“Stylistically it was too similar to be an imitation, it was of the right period, it was technically correct and it was painted on poplar, a material commonly used at the time.”

She added: “After removing the yellowing varnish, Xray and infrared examination revealed under-drawing, including changes to the final composition uncommon in straight imitations.”

The 1487 painting was long-assumed this painting was an imitation, by an unknown artist, because it varied in detail to the original and because of the thick yellow varnish that concealed the quality of the work.

‘Madonna Of The Pomegranate’ will go back on display when Georgian villa Ranger’s House reopens from April 1.

Facebook bans praise of white nationalism - Times of India

","
Facebook on Wednesday banned praise, support and representation of white nationalism and white separatism, a move that drew qualified approval from New Zealand where a massacre of 50 people in mosques was live streamed earlier this month.


Facebook has beefed up its content monitoring teams and taken down event pages that were used to promote and organise rallies by white supremacist groups. The policy will be enforced next week, it said in a blog post, and will apply to both its core Facebook app and Instagram.

Facebook has long banned white supremacy under its rules on ""hateful"" content, but did not previously consider white nationalist content to be explicitly racist. It would also start connecting people who search for terms associated with white supremacy to an organisation called Life After Hate.

Bangladesh high-rise office building catches fire, 19 dead - Times of India

","
DHAKA: A fire struck a high-rise office building in Bangladesh's capital on Thursday, killing 19 people and injuring about 70 others, officials said. It trapped many inside the building, with some shouting for help from windows on high floors or from the roof.


At least one person fell to the ground while attempting to climb down.

Fire officials said after battling the blaze for several hours that most had been rescued.

""The situation is under control,'' said Debashish Bardhan, a fire service and civil defense deputy director.

The fire at the FR Tower, on a busy avenue in Dhaka's Banani commercial district, was the latest in a city where flouted building regulations and safety norms have made deadly blazes common.

Shahadat Hossain, a central control room duty officer for the fire service and civil defense, said 19 people had died and about 70 others had been hospitalized. The cause was being investigated.

Firefighters shattered the building's glass walls to free toxic gas.

A Facebook Live video taken by Roy Pinaki showed five people climbing down from windows while burnt building materials fell around them. One person slipped from what appeared to be a rope that people were using to escape, bounced off utility wires and fell to the ground.

Military helicopters joined the rescue operation, and one person dangled from a helicopter hovering over the roof as thick plumes of smoke rose.

More than a dozen people who fled to the roof were rescued by firefighters using hydraulic cranes, Bardhan said.

Witness Sajib Hasan said some people shouted for help from the upper floors of the building. Onlookers shouted back their encouragement, some raising their hands to pray for the safety of those trapped. Heavy smoke deterred efforts by responders, but Hasan said he watched at least a dozen people get rescued.

Banani, the area where the fire broke out, is a busy commercial district with multistory buildings housing offices, universities and restaurants.

Dilip Kumar Ghosh, deputy director of the fire service, said bad traffic delayed the arrival of fire trucks at the building.

Tushar-or-Rashid, an employee of the Vivid Holidays tour company on the building's first floor, said the fire began above them.

""All of our staff have come out safely but we don't know what happened to the people who work in the upper floors,'' he said. Rashid said the building has 21 floors.

Fires are common in Bangladesh. Last month, a fire in the oldest part of Dhaka, a 400-year-old area cramped with apartments, shops and warehouses, left at least 67 people dead.

In 2012, a fire raced through a garment factory on the outskirts of Dhaka, killing at least 112 people trapped behind its locked gates. Less than six months later, another building containing garment factories collapsed, killing more than 1,100 people.

Another fire in a house illegally storing chemicals in Old Dhaka killed at least 123 people in 2010.

Russia-based Ukrainians miss out on vote amid conflict - Times of India

","
MOSCOW: Moscow-based Ukrainian programmer Ruslan Burma wants to cast his ballot for the country's president in nail-biting polls on Sunday, but he will not be able to vote.


Citing security reasons, Kiev has refused to open polling stations at five diplomatic missions in Russia, where more than 2.5 million Ukrainian nationals live.

Ukrainians go to the polls Sunday for the first round of voting.

Comedian and political novice Volodomyr Zelensky is leading in opinion polls, trailed by President Petro Poroshenko and former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko.

Burma, who did not give his real name for fear of repercussions, said leaving Russia to vote would be too expensive for him.

""I will be home in spirit this Sunday,"" the 33-year-old, who has lived in Moscow since 2013, told AFP. ""I will watch anxiously as they count the votes.""

Another Moscow-based Ukrainian, Yevgen Lozitsky, said he would not be able to vote because of a business trip.

The 37-year-old bow tie-sporting senior executive said he wished there was an online voting system that would allow Ukrainians to vote from anywhere in the world.

""I want to take part in these elections, I want to have a say in shaping my country's fate,"" he told AFP.

Lozitsky said five Russia-based Ukrainian friends were planning to leave Russia to vote.

He himself plans to vote next month if Poroshenko -- whom he supports -- makes it to a second-round run-off.

""Under him, Ukraine pivoted towards Europe,"" Lozitsky said.

He and Burma said that preventing eligible voters from taking part was not fair but they declined to blame the Ukrainian authorities.

Kiev says it was forced to close polling stations in Russia to ensure the safety of nationals and prevent arch-foe Russia from interfering in the election.

Ties between Kiev and Moscow have been wrecked since a 2014 popular uprising in Kiev ousted a Kremlin-backed regime and Russia retaliated by annexing Crimea and supporting a separatist uprising in eastern Ukraine.

The conflict has so far claimed some 13,000 lives.

""It's impossible to ensure an election process on the territory of the aggressor country,"" said Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin, referring to Russia.

The Ukrainian government says its nationals are free to vote in embassies in neighbouring Finland, Georgia or Kazakhstan.

Ukrainian nationals, who spoke to AFP outside the country's embassy in Moscow, scoffed at Kiev's explanations, however.

""It is safe here, just like in Ukraine -- only there's a war in the east there,"" said Denys Lukyanov, a 27-year-old Ukrainian.

Lykyanov said he was applying for Russian citizenship and did not plan to vote.

Some including Burma suggested the move was aimed at preventing pro-Russian voters from taking part in the election.

Klimkin insisted the closure of polling stations would not affect the result, saying just 1,100 Ukrainians voted in Russia during 2014 presidential polls.

""The decision to close down the polling stations is more symbolic in nature,"" said Kiev-based political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko.

Many Ukrainians living in Russia come from war-torn eastern Ukraine or annexed Crimea, he said.

Ukrainians who have lived in Russia for a long time do not usually vote in Kiev polls, he added.

Of the roughly six million people living in Crimea and separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine, most will probably not take part either.

They need to cross into Kiev-controlled territory at least twice to register and vote, an expensive and time-consuming procedure for some.

Many will not be eligible to vote after renouncing Ukrainian citizenship.

But some Crimean Tatars -- a Muslim community that largely rejected Moscow's annexation of the peninsula -- are determined to exercise their right to vote.

""I am a citizen of Ukraine and must vote for its future president,"" 75-year-old Nariman Abduramanov, who lives outside Crimea's largest city Simferopol, told AFP.

Edem Dudakov, a 59-year-old resident of the town of Bakhchisaray, said he had already registered to vote.

""I will vote for Poroshenko even though I am not crazy about his economic policies,"" he added.

Ahead of the poll Russia's FSB security service raided the homes of Crimean Tatars and detained at least 20 people suspected of belonging to a banned Islamist group.

Crimean Tatar politician Nariman Jelyal said the arrests would not stop those who wanted to vote in the Ukrainian election.

""They are committed people who've decided to perform their civic duties despite everything,"" he said.

Trump, Moon to meet in Washington in April: Seoul - Times of India

","
SEOUL: US President Donald Trump will host his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in next month, Seoul said Friday, after the latest summit between Washington and Pyongyang ended in deadlock.

Moon has long backed a policy of engagement with nuclear-armed, sanctions-hit Pyongyang and was instrumental in brokering talks between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. But the failure of Kim and Trump to reach an agreement in Hanoi on curtailing Pyongyang's nuclear programme in exchange for relaxation of sanctions has raised questions over the future of the process.

Moon will visit Washington for two days from April 10, an official from the South's presidential Blue House told AFP.

""The two leaders will have in-depth talks... to coordinate their stance on setting up a peace regime on the Korean peninsula through complete denuclearisation,"" Yoon Do-han, the senior presidential press secretary said Friday.

Earlier this month, Pyongyang abruptly pulled its staff out of an inter-Korean liaison office, but the officials came back to the joint facility in the Northern city of Kaesong days later.

Their return came after Trump announced he had ""ordered"" the withdrawal of additional sanctions — without identifying the measures — against Pyongyang by the US Treasury.

Woman delivers twins a month after first birth - Times of India

","
DHAKA: A Bangladeshi mother has stunned doctors by giving birth to healthy twins 26 days after a first child was born prematurely.


Arifa Sultana, 20, gave birth to a baby boy last month through normal delivery, but doctors missed the presence of a second uterus.

“She didn’t realise she was still pregnant with the twins. Her waters broke again 26 days after the first baby was born and she rushed to us,” Sheila Poddar, a gynaecologist who treated Arifa, said.

Podder carried out an emergency caesarean section to deliver the twins — one boy and one girl — last Friday.

The young woman was allowed to go home with her three healthy babies on Tuesday. Podder said there were no complications.

“I haven’t seen any case like this in my 30-year plus medical career,” Dilip Roy, chief government doctor in Jessore, said. He questioned the actions of Khulna Medical College Hospital doctors for not detecting the second pregnancy.

Hailing from a poor family, Sultana said she was happy with the children but felt concerned how she would bring them up. She said her husband earns barely 6,000 taka ($70) a month as a labourer. “I don’t know how we will manage such a huge responsibility with this little amount.”

Pakistan minister brands US envoy 'little pygmy' in Twitter row - Times of India

","
ISLAMABAD: A Pakistani minister has branded the US ambassador to Kabul a ""little pygmy"" in a high-level diplomatic Twitter row that erupted over ongoing peace talks between Washington and the Taliban in Afghanistan.


The furore underscores the delicate balance of regional tensions as the US steps up a push to find a way out of Afghanistan, more than 17 years after the invasion.

It began after Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan reportedly suggested an interim government in Afghanistan to help smooth the talks process, making the comment during a briefing with local reporters on Monday.

Khan's comments caused uproar in Afghanistan, which has long held neighbouring Pakistan's shadowy intelligence services responsible for supporting and training the Taliban.

Kabul recalled its ambassador on Tuesday, and the Pakistani foreign office tried to downplay Khan's comments on Wednesday, saying they had been reported ""out of context... leading to an unwarranted reaction"".

But shortly after US ambassador to Afghanistan John Bass issued a tweet rebuking Khan while alluding to his past as captain of Pakistan's World Cup-winning cricket team and numerous cheating scandals in the sport involving Pakistani players.

""Some aspects of #cricket apply well in diplomacy, some do not. @ImranKhanPTI, important to resist temptation to ball-tamper with the #Afghanistan peace process and its internal affairs. #AfgPeace,"" the tweet read.

Pakistanis outraged at the snub to their leader from a foreign envoy in another country took to Twitter in response- including Khan's minister for human rights, Shireen Mazari.

""Clearly you little pygmy your knowledge of ball tampering is as void as your understanding of Afghanistan and the region! Clearly in your case ignorance is certainly not bliss! Another sign of Trumpian mischief a la Khalilzad style!"" she wrote, referring to the US envoy leading the peace talks, Zalmay Khalilzad.

When the Twitterverse accused her of violating diplomatic norms, she doubled down.

""Haha! Haters gonna hate! But seriously what diplomatic norms? US dips have been violating them all day today from Zalmay to this moron!"" she wrote in response to one critic.

The Taliban have long refused to speak with Kabul, deeming the administration of President Ashraf Ghani -- who is seeking re-election this year- puppets of the West.

The US insists that it is negotiating with the insurgents on Afghan peace talks, but fears are sharp in Kabul that the government is being sidelined from its own peace process in Washington's rush to exit.

Many predict a US withdrawal before any peace deal is done with Kabul could see the Taliban return to some semblance of power in Afghanistan, or for the fighting to fracture into a full-blown ethnic civil war.

'Come with a plan,' UN chief tells world leaders ahead of climate summit - Times of India

","
UNITED NATIONS: UN chief Antonio Guterres has told world leaders to come up with concrete, realistic plans to boost climate action as greenhouse gas concentrations are driving global temperatures towards increasingly dangerous levels impacting millions of people.


'The State of the Global Climate' report was launched on Thursday by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and presents a grim picture of the accelerating physical signs and socio-economic impacts of the climate change across the world.

Secretary-General Guterres reiterated his call for action, underlining that the alarming conclusion of the report that climate change is accelerating, ""proves what we have been saying: climate change is moving faster than our efforts to address it.""

The UN chief said he has convened the 'Climate Action Summit' on September 23 and he is telling leaders, ""in September, please do not come with a speech; come with a plan.""

He said he is calling on leaders to come with concrete, realistic plans to put nations on a sustainable path once and for all.

""These plans must show how to enhance nationally determined contributions by 2020,"" he said.

The report states that physical signs and socio-economic impacts of climate change are accelerating as record greenhouse gas concentrations drive global temperatures towards increasingly dangerous levels.

The report notes that 2018 was the fourth warmest year on record and 2015-2018 were the four warmest years on record as the long-term warming trend continues.

Ocean heat content is also at a record high and global mean sea level continues to rise, while Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice extent is well below average.

Average global temperature reached approximately 1°C above pre-industrial levels and nations are not on track to meet climate change targets and rein in temperature increases, the report said.

""2018 saw new records for ocean heat content in the upper 700 metres (data record started in 1955) and upper 2000 metres (data record started in 2005), topping the previous record set in 2017. More than 90 per cent of the energy trapped by greenhouse gases goes into the oceans and ocean heat content provides a direct measure of this energy accumulation in the upper layers of the ocean,"" the report added.

Further, it said sea level continues to rise at an accelerated rate. ""Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) for 2018 was around 3.7 millimetres higher than in 2017 and the highest on record,"" it said.

In 2018, most of the natural hazards which affected nearly 62 million people were associated with extreme weather and climate events.

Floods continued to affect the largest number of people, more than 35 million, according to an analysis of 281 events recorded by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) and the UN International Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction, the report said.

The report said that millions continue to be displaced due to impact of climate change.

Out of the 17.7 million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) tracked by the International Organization for Migration, over two million people were displaced due to disasters linked to weather and climate events as of September 2018.

Drought, floods and storms (including hurricanes and cyclones) are the events that have led to the most disaster-induced displacement in 2018. President of the General Assembly, Maria Fernanda Espinosa, said she had pledged throughout her time in office there was a need for ""a holistic understanding of the socio-economic consequences of increasingly intense extreme weather on countries around the world"", adding that the report ""makes an important contribution to our combined international action to focus attention on this very critical problem.""

It was ""really not good news"" she told reporters during a press conference that carbon dioxide emissions had jumped from 1.6 per cent in 2017, to passing the 2.7 per cent emissions growth, during 2018.

""We need to act, and to act now. The numbers and data are extremely worrisome…We are capable, we have the science, we have the knowledge, we have the tools in hand"" to push back on global warming, she added.

The WMO said that the temperature rise last year, came despite the agreement by the international community in December 2015 in Paris, to curb carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, and to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degree Celcius.

""The time remaining to achieve commitments under the Paris Agreement is quickly running out,"" said WMO secretary-general, Petteri Taalas.

Outlining the report's key findings, Taalas warned of record greenhouse gas concentrations last year that drove global temperatures towards increasingly dangerous levels.

According to WMO, carbon dioxide levels were at 357 parts per million (ppm) in 1994, rising to 405.5 ppm in 2017.

Taalas also described ""striking"" evidence of record warming from 2015 to 2018, increasing sea-level rise and the loss of sea ice in both northern and southern polar regions.

Earlier, the General Assembly held a high-level meeting on climate change and sustainable development, including panel discussions on synergies between the two, and how the two agendas can be brought together in terms of concrete action.

Searching for ‘Florida Man’ is the latest internet fad - Times of India

","
ORLANDO: A new challenge making waves on social media pokes fun at Florida’s reputation for producing strange news stories involving guns, drugs, booze and reptiles — or some combination of the four.


The challenge invites participants to run their birthday and “Florida man” through a search engine to find out which headline pops up. Then they must post the result on social media.

The “Florida Man” concept crept into the nation’s consciousness with the @_FloridaMan Twitter account in 2013. The account, with the tagline “Real-life stories of the world’s worst superhero,” has been home to recent headlines such as “Florida Man Fire Bombs Garage That Impounded His Car, Hits His Own Vehicle” and “Florida Man Tried to Pay for McDonald’s With Weed.”

The less common, but no less noteworthy, “Florida Woman” subgenre has produced headlines such as “A Florida woman was arrested and charged with aggravated assault without intent to kill after she reportedly ‘farted loudly’ in a Dollar Store and then pulled a knife on a man who complained.”

“Once, it seemed as though all the weird people and stories came from California. But over the past decade, it shifted to Florida,” said Jim Clark, a lecturer in the University of Central Florida’s history department. “Now, when I see a bizarre story, I am surprised when it is not from Florida.”

A mixture of factors helps Florida birth these astounding tales.

For starters, it’s the nation’s third largest state, with more than 20 million residents, and a random sample of any population that large is guaranteed to produce its share of the outrageous. Florida is also blessed with a liberal public records law that allows these stories to surface into plain view with little resistance or concern about taste.

And then there’s the combination of subtropical temperatures, palm trees and endless blue skies that seems to inspire some people to shed all inhibitions.

Thanks to Florida’s strong public records laws it’s easy for journalists to get their hands on police incident reports and churn out attention-grabbing stories.

Under the right circumstances, couldn’t we be tempted to follow in the footsteps of “Naked Florida man revealed on video sneaking into restaurant and munching on ramen”?

Israelis unveil 'world's longest salt cave' - Times of India

","
MOUNT SODOM: Israeli cave explorers said Thursday that a salt cave with striking stalactites near the Dead Sea is the world's longest, beating the previous record-holder in Iran.


The cave named Malham, stretching over 10 kilometres (6.25 miles), runs through Mount Sodom, Israel's largest mountain, and spills out to the southwest corner of the adjacent Dead Sea.

Pale salt stalactites hang from the ceilings, and some of the walls sparkle with salt crystals. Drops of salty water are visible at the tips of some of the stalactites.

Malham became known to researchers through the work of Amos Frumkin, founder and director of the Hebrew University's Cave Research Centre, who in the 1980s mapped around five kilometres of it.

But in 2006, researchers mapped over six kilometres of the N3 cave in southern Iran's Qeshm island, granting it the widely recognised status of the world's longest salt cave.

Two years ago, Israeli spelunker Yoav Negev decided to complete Frumkin's work, reaching out to Bulgarian cave explorers for reinforcements with the promise of a warm winter adventure.

Negev, founder of the Israel Cave Explorers Club, joined forces with Boaz Langford, a researcher at the university's research centre, to organise a delegation of eight European spelunkers and another 20 locals.

They spent some 10 days mapping the cave in 2018.

A second 10-day expedition this year with 80 local and international spelunkers completed the measuring and mapping of the cave with lasers, determining its length at more than 10 kilometres.

Mount Sodom is essentially a huge salt block covered by a thin but resilient layer of cap rock.

The rare desert rains find their way through cracks in the cap rock and dissolve the salt to form small caves that flow down toward the Dead Sea.

Even in the short period of time since Frumkin's mapping, the cave's structure has changed, and will continue to do so.

Much of the cave's interior is covered by a fine dust that blows in from the desert. Massive slabs of salt, some amber-coloured from dust and minerals, jut out in dramatic formations.

A thin slab appearing to have been sliced out is nicknamed ""The Guillotine,"" while twin slabs in a different hall earned the title of ""The Ten Commandments.""

Reporters touring the site clambered and crawled through the narrow passages before reaching the ""wedding hall,"" where hundreds of white stalactites of various shapes and lengths created a festive backdrop.

To Negev, Malham was in ""a category of its own.""

""There's nothing like it in Israel,"" he said, claiming that no other cave came even close to the 10-kilometre mark.

Negev pointed to its vast network of ""caverns, passageways, piers, plateaus, one over another"".

He called it ""the most impressive and complex in Israel... and one of the most beautiful and fascinating ones I've been in"".

Negev downplayed the significance of retaking the title from Iran -- Israel's main enemy -- saying he had ""excellent ties"" with Iranian spelunkers through social media and professional conferences.

""The political rivalry creates a desire to connect and mutual curiosity,"" he said. ""They're really excellent spelunkers.""

""I wish I could visit there,"" he said of Iran and its caves.

How fake heiress made others foot her big bills - Times of India

","
NEW YORK: Anna Sorokin travelled in celebrity circles and tossed $100 tips - all the more reason to believe she was the German heiress she said she was. But behind the jet-set lifestyle and pricey threads, prosecutors have said, was a fraudster who bilked friends, banks and hotels for a taste of the high life.


Sorokin, 28, lived in luxury New York City hotel rooms she couldn't afford, promised a friend an all-expenses paid trip to Morocco and then stuck her with the $62,000 bill, and peddled bogus bank statements in a quest for a $22 million loan, the Manhattan district attorney's office has alleged.

On Wednesday, Sorokin went on trial on grand larceny and theft of services charges alleging she swindled various people and businesses out of $275,000 in a 10-month odyssey that saw her jetting to the Midwest and Marrakesh before landing in a cell at Rikers Island.

""Her overall scheme has been to claim to be a wealthy German heiress with approximately $60 million in funds being held abroad,"" prosecutor said after Sorokin's October 2017 arrest. ""She's born in Russia and has not a cent to her name as far as we can determine.""

""Anna had to fake it until she could make it,"" Sorokin's lawyer Todd Spodek said.

Sorokin, jailed since her arrest, faces deportation to Germany regardless of the outcome of the trial because authorities say she overstayed her visa. Her story, however, may stick around. Shonda Rhimes, the force behind ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Scandal,"" is developing a show about Sorokin for Netflix. Lena Dunham, of ""Girls"" fame, is working on one for HBO.

Single-use plastics to be banned in Europe - Times of India

","
STRASBOURG: The European Union decided to ban plastic consumer items including plates, cutlery and straws as of 2021 to help clean up oceans.


The prohibition on single-use plastics approved by the European Parliament on Wednesday in Strasbourg, France, also applies to beverage cups, food containers and cotton bud sticks. EU governments have already signaled support for the ban, making their final approval due on April 15 a formality.

With plastics accounting for around 80 percent of marine litter, the EU rushed through deliberations on the planned restrictions in less than a year. The European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, proposed the curbs in May 2018 and representatives of EU governments and the 751-seat Parliament reached a negotiated deal in December.

“Plastics poison our seas,” said Frederique Ries, a Belgian member who steered the draft law through the 28-nation assembly. “If we do not take action, by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the oceans.”

The new legislation also sets a 90 percent collection target for plastic bottles by 2029 and a 30% goal for recycled material in them by 2030.

FAA's safety check under lens as Boeing unveils software fix - Times of India

","
RENTON (WASHINGTON): Boeing on Wednesday made its most overt acknowledgment to date that new software in its jets could have played a role in two deadly crashes as it tries to convince pilots, airlines and regulators around the world that a coming fix will solve the problem.


Before a meeting with more than 200 pilots and airline executives at its factory in Renton, Washington, Boeing, for the first time, publicly laid out its proposed updates to the software as well other changes to the 737 Max that it hopes will get the plane flying again.

The changes would give pilots more control over the system and make it less likely to be set off by faulty data, two issues at the center of the investigations into the crashes. ""The rigor and thoroughness of the design and testing that went into the Max gives us complete confidence that the changes we're making will address any of these accidents,"" Mike Sinnett, Boeing's vice-president for product strategy, said.

The firm, which was eager to complete the plane quickly for competitive reasons, also faced new scrutiny in Washington on Wednesday over the development and certification of the jet, a process that regulators heavily delegated to Boeing. Senators, in two congressional hearings with Boeing's regulators, pressed for more oversight and raised the possibility of overhauling the system.

The acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration, in a hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee's aviation subcommittee, said that the agency initially scrutinized the new software independently, but ultimately left it to Boeing. The official, Daniel Elwell, also said he did not believe the automated system had been tested with a scenario involving a faulty sensor, which was a concern in a Lion Air crash in Indonesia in October.

The FAA has long allowed plane-makers to help certify that their new aircraft meet safety standards. In recent years, Boeing was able to choose its own employees to help regulators approve the 737 Max. Elwell defended the agency's practice, saying the strategy has ""consistently produced safe aircraft designs for decades"". And he said the agency would need 10,000 more employees and an additional $1.8 billion a year to do all the work now done by designated employees of the firms it regulates

""The FAA decided to do safety on the cheap, which is neither cheap nor safe,"" said Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal. ""The FAA put the fox in charge of the henhouse.""

A Boeing official cautioned against drawing any definite conclusions until more is known. ""In general, the process has worked and continues to work, and we see no reason to overhaul the process,"" this official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the investigations.

The Boeing official said that in most crashes, many things go wrong. Based on what is known about the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, Boeing said it felt that MCAS was in need of updating. ""We-'ve seen two accidents now and we believe it is appropriate to make that link in the chain more robust,"" the official said.

The updated software, which Boeing outlined on Wednesday, will rely on data from two so-called angle of attack sensors, so the plane will not have a single point of failure. It will also make it easier for pilots to override the system, which was originally designed to push down the nose of the plane repeatedly and aggressively. Although the fix is apparently ready, Boeing provided no timetable for installing it.

China reacts with caution, Pakistan calls it Quixotic - Times of India

","
ISLAMABAD/BEIJING: Pakistan on Wednesday mocked India for its successful test firing of anti-satellite missile and said that it was akin to attacking imaginary enemies. However, China was guarded in its reaction. Without mentioning names, Beijing said it hoped each country would uphold peace in outer space.


Taking a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailing the anti-satellite test as a major breakthrough in India’s space programme, the Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Dr Muhammad Faisal in a statement said: “Boasting of such capabilities is reminiscent of Don Quixote’s tilting against windmills.” 

Pakistan, he said, was against arms race in outer space and has been a strong proponent of prevention of arms race in Outer Space. “Space is the common heritage of mankind and every nation has the responsibility to avoid actions which can lead to the militarization of this arena,” he said.

There is a need to address the gaps in the international space laws with a view to ensuring that no one threatens peaceful activities and applications of space technologies for socio-economic development.

“We hope that countries which have in the past strongly condemned demonstration of similar capabilities by others will be prepared to work towards developing international instruments to prevent military threats relating to outer space,” the statement read.

The Chinese foreign ministry, in a written response to a question on the development, said: ""We have noticed reports and hope that each country will uphold peace and tranquility in outer space.""

Nirav Modi possibly owns two flats, not one, in London skyscraper - Times of India

","
LONDON: Wanted diamantaire Nirav Modi will be making his second court appearance in London on Friday when his lawyers are expected to make a second bail application for him.


The 48-year-old has been languishing in 

  one of Britain's most overcrowded prisons
 + - Wandsworth prison - since March 20 when he was remanded in custody after his first bail application was rejected by district judge Marie Mallon despite offering £500,000 as security and offering to report regularly at his local police station.



Nirav Modi's art collection fetches Rs 54 crore55 rare oil paintings by some of India’s finest artists like—V S Gaitonde, Raja Ravi Varma, F N Souza, K K Hebbar, Jogen Chowdhury, Akbar Padamsee, Arpana Caur—seized from fugitive jeweller Nirav Modi’s collection by tax authorities went under the hammer on Tuesday and fetched Rs 54 cr. Leading the sales was an untitled oil on canvas by Gaitonde that sold for Rs 22 cr.


On Friday Nirav, who is accused by the government of India of being involved in the fraudulent issuing of letters of undertaking (LoUs) in respect of Punjab National Bank worth £1.2 billion, will face a different judge at Westminster magistrates' court - the chief magistrate, Emma Arbuthnot, who oversaw the extradition trial of Vijay Mallya.

He will arrive in a prison van and appear in the dock. His barrister is expected to increase his bail security offer. The CBI and ED have flown over to attend the hearing and meet the UK legal team representing the government of India in the case.

Nirav is using the same solicitor as Mallya - Anand Doobay. Doobay's company, Boutique Law, boasts on its website: ""We have substantial experience acting for clients facing money laundering investigations and prosecutions. Our extensive experience of defending allegations of corruption and bribery involves cases both in the UK and overseas. We can also assist with applying to Interpol for access to information or for information including red notices to be amended or deleted.""

TOI can also reveal that Nirav owns not one but two £8 million flats in the 82-apartment skyscraper Centre Point where he lives. Both were paid for in cash.

Nirav has been living in the 2,133-sq-ft three-bedroom luxury apartment 42 on the 29th floor of Centre Point tower in central London since January 2018. The title deeds, which TOI has possession of, show that apartment 42, which is the address he gave in court, that is also linked to Diamond Holdings, was sold to a ""Richard Beattie"" on January 5, 2018 for £7,950,000 in cash. The same date, flat 5, also on the 29th floor, was also sold to Richard Beattie in cash for the same price. Both are registered as care of a London law firm that provides advice to wealthy individuals.

A well-placed source told TOI: ""I think the safe thing to assume is that Nirav Modi is Richard Beattie. Both flats have Nirav Modi's footprints all over them. He has probably asked someone like his butler or an accountant to put their name on the title deeds so he cannot be traced.""

The spokeswoman for the said law firm said: ""We are not able to comment on this.""

TOI also tracked down the London office of Diamond Holdings, the jewellery business that Nirav started on May 24, 2018, which is registered at the Harrow address of his accountants. The actual office though is situated in a secluded spot on the upper floors of a Georgian townhouse in Soho Square, which also houses 20th Century Fox, close to the Radha-Krishna Temple and the restaurant Govinda's. The white blinds were pulled down completely on the middle to upper floors when TOI visited as Krishna devotees were singing and dancing close by. There is no signage to Diamond Holdings on the exterior of the building. A company that lets out office space runs the building and lets out sections of it. Office spaces are let for a minimum of £3,850 per month with seven desks to £19,500 per month for 30 desks on minimum 12-month leases, TOI discovered.

The receptionist on the ground floor confirmed Diamond Holdings was in an office upstairs but said no one was allowed in to see them without prior appointment. ""We manage office spaces and they have let some. I have been told not to let anyone up there unless they have an appointment,"" he said.

When asked if Diamond Holdings was the only office there, he said, ""No, we have others,"" but gave the impression there was a team of staff working for Diamond Holdings.

""The secretary of Diamond Holdings has already gone home and she asked me not to let anyone in without an appointment. I don't know what they do or how long they have been here. I don't have any telephone number I can give you,"" he said.

Brazil's military start commemorations of 1964 coup - Times of India

","
RIO DE JANEIRO: Over the objections of human rights groups but with the support of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, some military bases began commemorations of the March 31, 1964 coup that launched 21 years of military rule in Brazil.


Brazil's Southeast military command, led by Gen. Luiz Baptista Pereira, held a commemoration ceremony in Sao Paulo.

The order of the day read in the base called March 31, 1964 a ""symbolic episode"" in the armed forces' support for the ""legitimate aspirations"" of Brazilian people.

""The Brazilian people defended democracy together with their uniformed citizens"" that day, it read. ""With Brazilian families alarmed and facing great disorder, the escalation toward communism was interrupted.""

With rifles on their shoulders, soldiers sang Brazil's national anthem and paraded.

Bolsonaro, a former army captain who waxes nostalgic for the 1964-1985 military regime and a fierce anti-communist, caused a commotion in Brazil when he asked the Defense Ministry to organize ""due commemorations"" on March 31, a day historians call a coup that began the dictatorship, which supporters call a ""military government.""

Brazil's federal prosecutor's office strongly criticized Bolsonaro's move, saying that under international criminal law Brazil's dictators ""had committed crimes against humanity."" Several civic groups announced that they were organizing protests throughout the country.

The decision to commemorate the coup anniversary ended a 2011 move by then-President Dilma Rousseff, who had asked armed forces to suspend such commemorations.

Government spokesman Otavio Rego Barros recently told reporters that ""the president does not believe March 31, 1964 was a coup.""

This hospital in US is using drones to fly blood samples - Times of India

","
NEW YORK: A pioneering use of drones to fly blood samples across a North Carolina hospital campus was launched on Tuesday in the latest move to expand their roles in business and health care. The short trips between WakeMed buildings in Raleigh mark the first time the Federal Aviation Administration has allowed regular commercial flights of drones carrying products, according to UPS and drone company Matternet, which partnered with the hospital on the program. 


“This is a turning point, and it’s an historic moment because this is the first FAA-sanctioned use of a (drone) for routine revenue-generating flights,” Bala Ganesh, vice president of UPS’ advanced technology group, said in an interview before the announcement. 

The FAA confirmed in a statement on Monday that it hadn’t previously allowed drones to make routine commercial package deliveries, known as revenue flights. Others have flown drone deliveries as part of smaller-scale tests or demonstrations.

US lawmaker introduces resolution demanding Pak action on eliminating safe haven for terrorists - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: A resolution demanding action by Pakistan on eliminating a safe haven for terrorists was introduced in the US Congress on Thursday by a lawmaker.


Introduced by Congressman Scott Perry in the US House of Representatives, the resolution also condemned the Pulwama attack carried out by Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) suicide bomber on February 14 that killed 40 Indian paramilitary jawans.

""Enough is enough. Now is the time to hold the Pakistani government accountable,"" Perry, a Republican Congressman from Pennsylvania, said after introducing the resolution.

""Pakistan has a long history of harbouring terrorists and terrorist sympathisers, despite continued American efforts to root out bad actors in the region,"" he said.

The resolution also calls for the US States to recognise the threat of JeM, reaffirm America's commitment to end Pakistani-based terror and acknowledge India's continued commitment to prevent terrorism in the region.

""Actively choosing lax enforcement has cost innocent lives and emboldens radicals to perpetuate similar attacks,"" Perry said.

PM Theresa May makes final push on EU divorce deal, vote likely today - Times of India

","
LONDON: British PM Theresa May made a final push on Thursday to save her European Union withdrawal agreement after her promise to step down gained the deal some support but failed to win over lawmakers from Northern Ireland.


The government announced there would be a previously unscheduled Brexit debate in Parliament on Friday - but did not confirm whether it would include a new vote on May's twice-rejected EU divorce agreement. The EU has said the PM must secure approval for her deal by 11pm (UK time) on Friday if the UK is to be given an automatic delay of its departure date from the bloc until May 22.

Otherwise, Britain has until April 12 to announce a new plan, or leave the bloc without a deal. Announcing Friday's debate, House of Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom did not say whether it would include a vote on May's deal. Commons Speaker John Bercow has said the government can't bring the rejected deal back a third time unless it has been changed.

May pledged on Wednesday that she would resign if her Brexit deal was approved, in hopes of blunting opposition from those who have criticised her leadership.

ROCHESTER: Kodak says a new beer hitting the market can be used to develop its Super 8 movie film.


Dogfish Head Craft Brewery in Delaware created its SuperEIGHT beer after a conversation with people at Kodak, the upstate New York technology company most famous for its photographic roots.

Dogfish learned from Kodak that heightened levels of acidity and vitamin C in certain beers could make them a processing agent for film. That inspired the brewery to design such a beer. Kodak helped by testing it.

Dogfish founder Sam Calagione says he'll document his summer travels on Super 8 film that will be developed in SuperEIGHT beer and turned into a short film.

The beer, made with pear, mango, berries, kiwi, quinoa and salt, is set for national distribution next month.

Venezuela's Maduro announces ban on rival holding public office - Times of India

","
CARACAS: Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's regime, bolstered by a Russian military deployment infuriating the US, on Thursday announced a ban on Washington-backed self-declared interim leader Juan Guaido holding public office.


But National Assembly legislature speaker Guaido immediately shot back that the 15-year prohibition announced on state television by Maduro's Auditor General Elvis Amoroso was invalid.

""He is not auditor general.... The legitimate congress is the only one with power to designate an auditor general,"" he said.

The announcement also prompted a withering response from Washington, where State Department spokesman Robert Palladino described the move in a brief remark as ""ridiculous.""

It was the latest scuffle between Maduro and Guaido, who lay rival claims to be the legitimate leader of the oil-producing South American nation of 30 million people.

The competition has been escalated into a geopolitical struggle, drawing in the US and its allies which support Guaido, and Russia, Cuba and China backing Maduro.

Though unpopular in a country spiraling ever deeper into economic chaos, Maduro has the upper hand at home, thanks to loyalty from his military chiefs and, since last weekend, the presence of 100 Russian troops.

Abroad, Guaido is buoyed by US sanctions against Maduro's regime funneling funds his way, and efforts to have his envoys recognized over Maduro's in diplomatic missions and international organizations.

Maduro, who so far has heeded US warnings to not arrest Guaido under threat of unspecified repercussions, appears nonetheless more confident since Moscow's overt protection.

Moscow on Thursday shrugged off a demand made a day earlier by US President Donald Trump that ""Russia has to get out"" of Venezuela.

Its troops, described as military experts, will stay ""for as long as needed,"" a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin said, suggesting Washington back off and not interfere.

On Monday, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the US of organizing a ""coup"" in Venezuela.

Some reports said the soldiers were there to operate air defense systems bought from Russia.

The US has reacted angrily to Russia's move, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressing Washington's displeasure in a tweet that borrowed a Maduro hashtag usually aimed at America.

""Maduro calls for hands off Venezuela while he invites security forces from Cuba and Russia, so he and his cronies can keep plundering Venezuela,"" Pompeo posted.

""It is time for Venezuelan institutions to stand for their sovereignty. Russia and Cuba, #HandsOffVenezuela.""

The US tactics, so far, have been focused on ratcheting up sanctions. Those will jump to a critical level for Venezuela in a month's time, on April 28, when America will impose a ban on imports of Venezuelan oil.

With the United States as Venezuela's main customer for crude, that step is expected to severely impact Maduro's already depleted state coffers.

The standoff has seen the US pull its diplomats from Venezuela, and American Airlines, which had already temporarily suspended flights to the country over security concerns, said Thursday that it was doing so indefinitely.

Months of increasingly tough US sanctions, coupled with mismanagement by Maduro's regime as it took over businesses and key sectors of the economy, and also corruption and many years of infrastructure underinvestment, have taken a toll.

Between Monday and late Wednesday, Venezuelans endured their second nationwide blackout this month. The previous one, unprecedented in scale and duration, lasted a week.

The outages knocked out transport, water supplies, communications and bank card terminals, closing schools and public offices, while also reducing frozen stocks of already scarce food.

Analysts said the oil sector, which brings in 96 percent of state revenue, was all but paralyzed.

For ordinary Venezuelans, the blackouts were a devastating blow on top of the hyperinflation and food insecurity that were pushing many to the brink of survival.

""This makes anyone desperate... Enough!"" said Mauro Hernandez, a 57-year-old Caracas resident forced to walk 90 minutes to get to work.

Maduro's government blamed the blackouts on US ""cybernetic"" attacks and ""terrorist acts"" by the opposition.

On Thursday, Communications Minister Jorge Rodriguez asserted that power had been restored to ""most"" of Venezuela and said that public offices -- but not schools -- will reopen on Friday after a multi-day closure.

But many continue to abandon the collapsing country, which has been abandoned by nearly three million Venezuelans since 2015, according to the UN.

And an internal UN report obtained by AFP on Thursday said that about 24 percent of the country's population — seven million people — are in dire need of humanitarian aid.

No terror camp in India-cited areas: Pakistan on Delhi's dossier - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI/ISLAMABAD: Expressing disappointment at Pakistan effectively rejecting India's dossier on Jaish-e-Muhammed's complicity in the Pulwama terror attack, the government on Thursday said Islamabad regrettably continued to be in denial as it even refused to acknowledge Pulwama as a terror attack.


Pakistan, the government said, had not shared details of credible action, if any, taken by it against terrorists or terrorist organisations based in territories under its control.

Indian high commissioner Ajay Bisaria sought concrete and irreversible action against terror sanctuaries in a meeting with Pakistani officials on Wednesday.

""We are hardly surprised, as this identical script was followed by Pakistan in the past, after the terror attacks in Mumbai in 2008 or in Pathankot in 2016. It is a well-known fact that the JeM and its leader Masood Azhar are based in Pakistan. This was again acknowledged recently to international media by Pakistan's foreign minister. There's no dearth of sufficient actionable information and evidence in Pakistan itself to take action against them, if there is sincerity and intent to do so,"" the government said in a statement, while adding that it was still examining the paper handed over by Pakistan.

Pakistan earlier on Thursday rejected the dossier submitted by India on the Pulwama attack and said the preliminary investigation established no links of any Pakistani, including Azhar, with the suicide bombing. Pakistan's foreign ministry also denied the existence of the 22 terrorist camps in Pakistan which had been mapped by India in its 91-page document.

A ministry of foreign affairs (MoFA) statement said that while 54 detainees were being investigated, no evidence linking them to Pulwama attack had been found so far. ""Similarly, the 22 pin locations shared by India have been examined. No such camps exist. Pakistan is willing to allow visits, on request, to these locations,"" the statement said. Amid pressure from the global community, Pakistani authorities had taken Azhar's son and brother in ""preventive custody"" in the first week of March.

India also asked Pakistan to abide by the commitment it gave in 2004 vowing not to allow any territory under its control to be used for terrorism against India. Pakistani foreign office spokesperson Mohammad Faisal said on Thursday that Pakistan had informed India that it was ready to cooperate if they have actionable intelligence and evidence that would pass muster with Pakistani courts.

Israel carries out air attack in Syria: report - Times of India

","
DAMASCUS: Syria said on Wednesday that Israel had attacked targets just north of the city of Aleppo and that its defences had shot down several missiles.


If confirmed, it would be the first attack on Syrian territory since US President Donald Trump on Monday recognised Golan Heights -- seized from Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War -- as Israeli territory, a move which breaks with decades of international consensus.

""Army air defences repels an Israeli air aggression that targeted a number of industrial sites in Sheikh Najjar industrial zone, north-east of Aleppo, and downed a number of the hostile missiles,"" Syria's official SANA news agency said, citing an unnamed military source.

War monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the Israeli bombardment hit ""ammunition stores belonging to Iranian forces and allied groups, and caused huge explosions.""

It added that at least four people, believed to be warehouse guards, were killed.

A number of residents of Aleppo told AFP that the attack led to a power cut in the whole city.

Israel has carried out hundreds of air strikes in Syria in the past few years targeting positions held by its main enemy Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, with the goal of stopping Iran from entrenching itself militarily in the war-torn country.

Iran is a major supporter of President Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian civil war.

In January Israel hit a number of Iranian installations in the country, hours after intercepting a rocket fired from Syrian territory.

The Observatory said 21 people, mostly Iranians, were killed in those attacks.

In May 2018, Israeli strikes killed 27 pro-regime fighters including 11 Iranians in strikes on dozens of Iranian targets inside Syria.

Trump, Moon to meet in Washington in April: Seoul - Times of India

","
SEOUL: US President Donald Trump will host his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in next month, Seoul said Friday, after the latest summit between Washington and Pyongyang ended in deadlock.

Moon has long backed a policy of engagement with nuclear-armed, sanctions-hit Pyongyang and was instrumental in brokering talks between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. But the failure of Kim and Trump to reach an agreement in Hanoi on curtailing Pyongyang's nuclear programme in exchange for relaxation of sanctions has raised questions over the future of the process.

Moon will visit Washington for two days from April 10, an official from the South's presidential Blue House told AFP.

""The two leaders will have in-depth talks... to coordinate their stance on setting up a peace regime on the Korean peninsula through complete denuclearisation,"" Yoon Do-han, the senior presidential press secretary said Friday.

Earlier this month, Pyongyang abruptly pulled its staff out of an inter-Korean liaison office, but the officials came back to the joint facility in the Northern city of Kaesong days later.

Their return came after Trump announced he had ""ordered"" the withdrawal of additional sanctions — without identifying the measures — against Pyongyang by the US Treasury.

Plans to return or migrate elsewhere emerge for over 80,000 Indian families in US - Times of India

","
The American Dream is fast turning into a nightmare for nearly 80,000 plus families from India, where a spouse is currently holding an employment authorisation document (EAD). This programme, that enabled spouses of certain category of H-1B visa holders, to work, is expected to end in the coming months.


Many families have kept ready a plan B - typically it entails a return back home or migration to another country. Some spouses will even try to convert their dependant H-4 visa, into a H-1B work visa, even as this task has its own challenges.

Spouses of H-1B workers are given an H-4 visa. Only in those cases where the H-1B visa recipient is on track for a green card, can the H-4 spouse apply for an EAD.




With a green card backlog running into several decades for Indians, an EAD opened the doors for employment (including self-employment). It meant more than financial freedom, as the work authorisation also enabled spouses to obtain a social security number, open a bank account and get a driving license.

A 29-year-old, HR specialist, who moved to US in 2015 (post her marriage) and is currently working in large tech company headquartered in Menlo Park, California says: ""I moved knowing that the EAD option was available. Else I would have forced my spouse to look at other options, at the outset itself.""

American Immigration Council, a not-for-profit body points out: ""The highly-skilled individuals that US employers hope to attract and employ on a H-1B visa often have a spouse or family to consider. If the spouse retains the option of being employed, the US employer can provide a more appealing and competitive job offer.""

 ""My field is non-STEM; hence it is extremely difficult to get an H-1B sponsorship. This doesn't make me less skilled or talented. I worked hard to get an MBA seat. I've also done a specialised HR certification in US,"" she adds. Given the uncertainty, she and her husband have put on hold purchase of a house in US, instead they are concentrating on obtaining a Canadian permanent residency as a backup option.

Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris is one of the several senators who has vowed to fight against revocation of EAD. Her tweet: ""This is outrageous and will force immigrant women who are doctors, nurses, scientists and academics among others to abandon their professional careers,"" squarely covers Dr Shilpa's predicament. 

Thirty-four years old and a dentist by profession, Shilpa (last name withheld on request), post her marriage moved to the US in 2012. She pursued further studies, as the EAD program was introduced only in 2015 by the Obama administration.

She obtained her EAD in 2016, but took some time off to look after her family and is now hunting for career opportunities. ""No employer wants to deal with the mess that these policy changes are creating. Getting a job has become difficult. If things don't work out, returning to India appears to be a wise option,"" she says.

Revocation of EAD will also harm the US economy, say some experts. A recent report by American Action Forum, a policy think tank, which has used the community survey (aka census) data, estimates that H-4 workers are more highly educated and have higher earning on average than the overall U.S. working population. Currently, they contribute an estimated $12.9 billion annually to the U.S. economy. If every eligible H-4 visa holder were to obtain work authorisation, their economic contributions could increase to roughly $41 billion per year.

Saveh4EAD, a group that started in December 2017, which currently has an outreach of 7000 plus via Facebook, had conducted a survey (sample size around 2400), which found that 59% of the respondents had a postgraduate or professional degree. Nearly 57% of them were in US for more than 5 years, 60% paid taxes of more than $ 5,000 and 58% of them had US born children.

EAD holders who are entrepreneurs also directly create jobs for Americans. Akhila Tadinada, a 34 year old, having a masters in electrical engineering, has been mired in the green card backlog for the past nine years. She has worked in the technology sector for close to a decade with an H-1B visa. In 2018, she obtained an EAD and set up her own company. ""My startup 'Xemelgo' builds solutions for the American manufacturing sector. If I lose my EAD, the company may need to shut, this will impact jobs for several people,"" says Tadinada. If this happens, she has kept open the option of moving back to the job market and finding an employer who will sponsor her for an H-1B.

The draft for rescinding the EAD program is under review by the Office of Management and Budget. Once released, in the coming weeks, public comments will be invited prior to finalisation. EAD holders are grouping together, such as via the Saveh4EAD group, to make their voice heard.

'Grand alliance' failed to take off as Rahul Gandhi did not override local satraps: Tarun Gogoi - Times of India

","
GUWAHATI: The opposition's anti-BJP 'grand alliance' failed to take the desired shape as Congress president Rahul Gandhi chose not to ""override"" the sentiments of state leaders who did not favour the move, party veteran and three-time Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi said.


Gogoi, a six-term former MP and union minister, also rubbished the BJP's allegation of the Congress being a ""dynastic"" party, insisting it was the ""most democratic"" in the country.

He said despite the opposition alliance being nebulous because of lack of formal tie-ups, the anti-BJP parties were united in their intent of defeating the saffron party and its allies.

""Rahul Gandhi was keen on alliance most of the time. But the local party leaders said no. Our party gives importance to regional leadership. That is why we have not been able to form alliances in many places,"" Gogoi told PTI in an interview.

""Though the Congress is often dubbed as a dynastic party, it is the most democratic party. Rahul Gandhi does not override the sentiments of local leaders who are heard and given due importance,"" he said.

Gogoi, when asked if a pre-poll pact between potential partners of the proposed grand alliance could have got them more seats, said nobody can predict that with any amount of certainty.

The Assam leader also appeared to favour the largest party in a winning coalition deciding which direction the government would take.

""Even in case of alliance, the largest party can administer and rule the country. That is also needed. The single largest party must have sufficient strength so that it is not dependent on alliance all the time. Otherwise, the alliance (its smaller constituents) will dictate. And that is not good for the country,"" he said.

Referring to the seat sharing agreement between the Congress and CPM for the West Bengal assembly elections in 2016, he said it was not beneficial as ""sometimes alliances do not help and go against our own interest"".

The Congress leader conceded that uniting all opposition parties on one platform is not an easy task as ideological differences and reluctance to cede political space to each other often come in the way.

""Yes, votes get divided because of this. But who will make the sacrifice? Nobody will sacrifice. Why should we leave our seat when the other party doesn't? Yes, is will be better if things are done in the spirit of give and take, but that is not possible because of divergence and differences among us,"" he said.

Gogoi was responding to a question about division of secular votes in 2014 that helped BJP secure a majority in the Lok Sabha on its own, the strongest public mandate secured by any party since 1984 when the Congress had won a landslide.

""How much vote did they (BJP) get last time? Only 31 per cent. He (Modi) only gave an impression that he is the most popular prime minister. Probably, he is the only one to become the prime minister with lowest percentage of votes,"" Gogoi said.

When asked about Congress's failure to clinch an electoral pact with the CPM in West Bengal, the former chief minister said it was because the two were on the rival side of the political divide in Kerala.

""If we praise them here, how will we criticise them there?""

He, however, insisted all opposition parties were unanimous in their view that they must fight the Narendra Modi government's ""dictatorial and pro-rich"" policies.

The Congress veteran leader claimed the Centre's assertions on development were ""sheer propaganda"".

""Farm distress, job loss, slowdown in construction and manufacturing, failure to check price rise, fall in exports and decline in GDP....overall the the Indian economy is in a bad shape. Indications are that the country is on decline. It is not moving up, but going down,"" he claimed.

Gogoi was, however, optimistic about the Congress's prospects in the elections despite the opposition alliance failing to take off the way it should have.

""The Congress's prospects this time are very good. I think it will get around 200 seats. Indian people are intelligent. They would sometimes punish and then reward,"" he said, apparently the party's lowest ever tally of 44 seats in 2014 LS polls weighing on his mind.

He also maintained the BJP's tally in states like Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, where it had scored impressive victories like never before, will go down.

Male contraceptive pill passes safety test in humans - Times of India

","
LONDON: Scientists have brought the development of a “male contraceptive pill” one step closer to reality with the trial of a capsule which limits the activity of sperm with few side effects.


In a month-long study of 40 men, conducted by the University of Washington, researchers looked into the effectiveness of a once-daily capsule that aims to suppress levels of hormones which drive the production of sperm and testosterone in the testes.

The doctors found that levels of the hormones fell in men who took the daily capsules, suggesting that their sperm counts had been noticeably reduced.

As the study’s primary goal was to assess safety, researchers now say the next step will be to perform a longer trial which will help confirm the decline and determine if it is sufficient. The team suggest that the drug would take at least 60 to 90 days to affect sperm production.

Stephanie Page, a professor of medicine and co-senior investigator on the trial at the University of Washington, said: “The goal is to expand contraceptive options and create a menu of choices for men like we have for women.

“We are neglecting a major potential user population with the limited options currently available to men.”

Out of the 40 men involved, ten participants were given a placebo capsule – a pill that does not contain an active drug ingredient.

The other 30 men received 11-beta-MNTDC but in different doses. While 14 took a 200mg dose, the remaining 16 took a 400mg dose.

Participants took the drug once daily with food for 28 days. The study found drug side effects were mild and included fatigue, acne or headache in four to six men each.

Christina Wang, a co-senior investigator on the trial at LA BioMed, said: “This study is very short and we need three months if not more to stop sperm production”.

“All we have shown so far is that it shuts down the hormones that control the function of the testes.” The researchers added it could be a decade before a male pill is on the market. However, there is still strong demand.

Executive ran, raised Rs 55 lakh for 25 farm widows’ homes 

","
Three months after Sudhir Shenoy, chief executive officer (CEO) of Dow India and member of NGO Habitat for Humanity India’s (HHI) advisory committee, ran his 51st marathon at Tata Mumbai Marathon 2019 and raised Rs 55 lakh to build 25 homes for farmers’ widows in Morshi in Amravati district, he laid the first brick at Ashtegaon in Morshi. 

“The marathon was on January 20. I completed half the race (21km). The funds were raised from my friends, family and other professional contacts and networks. This is my personal initiative and not a corporate one,” said Shenoy (49).

“My husband committed suicide due to financial burden. It has been a traumatic experience. He died once, but I die every day. I have to live and be strong for my children,” said Vaishali Mahalla, who is building a home in partnership with HHI as part of this project.

More than 12,000 farmers have committed suicide due to agrarian crisis in Maharashtra. These farmers leave behind distraught widows and kids, many having no roof over their head. To help these women be on their feet, HHI has partnered with several farmers families across Maharashtra. Over the last three years, HHI has built homes for 140 distressed families in Osmanabad, Amravati, Washim and Yavatmal districts. The approximate home area is 300 sqft and costs around Rs 2 lakh each. The subsidy varies somewhat based on individual situation. The home owner brings in some (10-15%) sweat equity at least.

“It is the solemn duty of every like-minded citizen to help the widows of deceased farmers rebuild their lives. We need to roll out concrete financial inclusion initiatives for women who continue to remain the most vulnerable section of the population in rural areas. Social organizations and corporate sector need to synergize their efforts and resources to ensure maximum financial outreach and economic security for marginalized populations in the country,” said Shenoy.

“It is heartening to see how one person can create a ripple effect. Through his support Shenoy has proved to be a true champion. His dedication and belief in HHI’s work will enable us to build strength, stability and self-reliance for the families of these 25 widows in Amravati district,” said Rajan Samuel, managing director, HHI.

SRH vs RR Preview: Sunrisers Hyderabad out to tame Rajasthan Royals 

","
HYDERABAD: Out 'muscled' by a Jamaican who goes by the name of Andre Russell, Sunrisers Hyderabad will look to make amends against a side which is reeling under the 'Mankad' effect. Like the Sunrisers, Rajasthan Royals too were cruising towards victory when a 'game-changer' act by Kings XI Punjab skipper R Ashwin turned the match on its head. The off-spinner 'ran out' Jos Buttler and the Royals caved in meekly thereafter. Smarting under the 'unlikely' losses, both teams are keen to regroup quickly and get their campaign off the ground as they lock horns at the RGIC Stadium, here on Friday night.



IPL Schedule | 
IPL Points Table

The hosts have much to cheer about as their top three batsmen were among the runs in Kolkata. As a duck takes to the water, opener David Warner seamlessly blended himself with the team. The one-year 'forced' break seems to have had no effect on the pocket dynamite. In fact, Warner looked hungry and keen on showing what the fans had missed last season. On way to a 53-ball 85, the Australian had become the first batsman in IPL to post 40 fifty plus innings (3 hundreds and 37 fifties) but to his chagrin Russell stole the thunder. 



With Jonny Bairstow and Vijay Shankar getting runs under the belt and Yusuf Pathan and Manish Pandey in the ranks, the Sunrisers look a much improved batting side. However, the Sunrisers will have to contend against Jofra Archer. The Barbardian born bowler, who is eligible to play for England and is likely to be in their World Cup squad, not only generates genuine pace but is also a very crafty one. Against the explosive Kings XI, Archer conceded just 17 runs in his four overs. The others to watch out for will be Dhawal Kulkarni and K Gowtham.

The hosts' concern will be the bowling which was taken part by Russell on Sunday. Barring leggie Rashid Khan, none of the others could make much of an impact and that is something the hosts will have to address. The Sunrisers, over the years, have taken pride in their bowling attack. They have mastered the art of defending small totals and hence being torn to shreds in the opening game is some food for thought for the team management.



The Sunrisers' bowlers will undergo another acid test as the Royals too boost of an aggressive batting line-up. Buttler, on Monday, showed what kind of damage he is capable of inflicting on the opposition. 



Skipper Ajinkya Rahane is a 'man on a mission' as he is keen on proving his critics wrong. Sanju Samson, Steve Smith and the big-hitting Ben Stokes give the Royals a formidable look. The dangerman will be Smith as the Australian has the uncanny ability to rotate the strike and also go for the big hits when needed. But the way they lost six wickets for just 20 runs at the death against Kings XI is something which they need to look into on an urgent basis as the Sunrisers' bowlers will be eagerly waiting to exploit the chinks in the Royals armour.

Lok Sabha elections: EC likely to urge SC not to change VVPAT protocol - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Election Commission is likely to request Supreme Court not to alter the system of counting VVPAT paper slips for one randomly-selected polling station per assembly segment when the election process has begun, saying that it has met voter confidence standards.


Sources said EC is likely to inform the court that preparation for deployment of trained poll officials for conduct of general elections is at an advanced stage and it would be fraught with practical difficulties to change the protocol with regard to counting procedures. The current practice has also passed muster with the Indian Statistical Institute.

SC had asked EC if it could on its own increase the number of EVMs per assembly segment whose vote count could be matched with VVPAT paper trails. The query had come on a petition filed by leaders of 21 non-NDA parties led by Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu, who called for a VVPAT paper slip count in at least 50 per cent of EVMs to ""re-establish"" voters' faith in the machines.

The plea followed an intensely political debate with several opposition parties claiming that EVMs were vulnerable to ""hacking"" and suggested that BJP has been a beneficiary of such manipulation. A demonstration by EC that the machines do not have a wireless connection and have been repeatedly tested, failed to quell the dispute.

With the current EC practice of counting paper trail for one polling station per assembly segment purportedly meeting ISI standards for VVPAT slips that need to be counted for maximum voter confidence, the poll watchdog may request SC to let it continue with the practice. However, EC may not be averse to changes in the long term.

TOI has learnt that ISI has suggested alternatives for the absolute number of VVPAT slips to be counted to ensure a given level of people's confidence in fairness and integrity of the poll process. The EC practice of matching paper trail in one polling station each in every assembly segment, said a source, passes the ISI test.

Sources said EC is concerned at practical hurdles in revising the counting protocols with general elections to Lok Sabha and four state assemblies underway. Any change in counting procedures at this stage will require fresh training of officers and staff and more manpower. Doing so in the middle of polls will be a strain on EC as the deployment plans of duly-trained polling and counting staff were worked out well in advance.

Another key concern of the commission is likely delay in results in the event of extent of paper trail tally with EVM count being raised. It be recalled that counting during the last round of assembly polls in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Mizoram held in November-December last year, could be completed only around midnight, with the tightened counting protocols and matching VVPAT and EVM count in one randomly-selected polling station of every assembly constituency taking up extra time.

Mahindra Car Price Hike: Mahindra to increase price of vehicles by up to Rs 73,000 from April

","
NEW DELHI: Auto major Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) Thursday said it will increase the price of its passenger and commercial vehicles by Rs 5,000 to Rs 73,000 from April to partially offset the impact of rising input costs.


The price of the company's vehicles will go up by 0.5 per cent to 2.7 per cent from next month due to the price hike, the company said in a statement.

""This year has seen record high commodity price increases. Further there are regulatory requirements effective April 1 that have also led to cost increases. While we have made efforts to reduce our costs, it has not been possible to hold back the price increase,"" M&M President Automotive Sector Rajan Wadhera said in the statement.

Consequently, the company is taking a price increase from April 1, he added.

The company sells various utility vehicles ranging from newly launched compact SUV XUV300 to premium SUV Alturas G4. M&M also sells various commercial vehicles including Supro and Jeeto in the domestic market.

Earlier this week, French car maker Renault had announced increase in price of Kwid range in India by up to 3 per cent from April.

Last week, Tata Motors had also announced increase in price of its passenger vehicles by up to Rs 25,000 from April on account of rising input costs and external economic conditions.

M&M joins the likes of Toyota and Jaguar Land Rover which have also stated that they would raise price of select models from April.

Priyanka Gandhi: Should I fight from Varanasi, Priyanka Gandhi asks party workers 

","
NEW DELHI: It was a stock query for 

  Priyanka Gandhi Vadra
 + , but one that elicited an unexpected answer. ""Varanasi se lad lun (should I contest from Varanasi?)"" - Priyanka's response to a party worker's query at a meeting in Rae Bareli on Thursday immediately set off fevered political speculation.


The comment is being interpreted in various ways. It could be mere repartee devoid of any deeper intent or could reveal a desire to take the electoral plunge. After all, it came a day after she answered the same question, saying that if the party felt so, she would be all too 

  happy to contest the election
 + .

The brief remark was enough to set a buzz and get the media interested, given that the temple town of Varanasi is the constituency of PM Narendra Modi.

According to reports, the comment came at a Congress workers' meeting in Rae Bareli fromn where Sonia Gandhi is to contest once again, with a group insisting that Priyanka fight the polls. The implied suggestion, a party source said, could be that she could step into her mother's shoes.

However, they were in for a shock when Priyanka turned back and asked how if she contested from Varanasi. While making it clear that she was open to contesting, she has also made it a point to add that her personal wish was to work for the party organisation as a lot of work had to be done.

Ever since Priyanka took the political plunge in January, the latest Gandhi to do so, there has been speculation if she would also make an electoral debut. With Sonia running again from her constituency and brother Rahul in Amethi, the possibility of her going to Varanasi ""to tie down the PM to his seat"" has been doing the rounds in party circles.

Priyanka's own allusion to Varanasi is set to stoke this speculation which, given its sensational implication, may set the political campaign abuzz. As the news spread, a party sympathiser claimed that even in 2014, Priyanka had toyed with the idea of taking on Modi, BJP's then prime ministerial nominee. However, the plan was shelved.

Given the charge of rejuvenating Congress in Uttar Pradesh, Priyanka is on a tour of the family turf of Amethi and Rae Bareli. She will visit Ayodhya on Friday before returning to the capital.

Pollitical comedy is booming - Times of India

","
PM Modi, sporting tattooed muscled arms, walks into the WWE ring. The crowd breaks into a cheer as he tackles Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav. The tackily edited video ends with a triumphant Yadav walking to victory. The clip has clearly fired people’s imagination, racking up 7.7 million views in the last couple of months.

Last week, a video about Congress president Rahul Gandhi styled as Gully Boy went viral too, helped along by Congress twitter handles. Stand-up comic Kunal Kamra’s scathing take on politics got 5.4 million views this week, while political satirist Akash Banerjee says he has added one lakh subscribers in the last 30 days.


Away from election rallies and neighbourhood chai pe charchas, online satire has boomed in the last couple of months. As Rahul Ram from Aisi Taisi Democracy sang recently, “Phir aaya hai time to choose… who will screw us more?’’ from his song Chunav ka maheena, a take-off from the popular 70s track Saavan ka maheena. But unlike the sharp satire interspersed with song that Aisi Taisi, a comedy collective comprising Sanjay Rajoura, Rahul Ram and Varun Grover is known for, most online comedy lampoons political leaders using Bollywood references. So with some deft editing, the same videos feature Modi, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and UP CM Yogi Adityanath alternatively as Gabbar Singh, Singham and Don.

“
Politics mein bhi entertainment hona chahiye. People are more keen to see Modi and Rahul, rather than Salman Khan and SRK,” says Lucknow-based Faizaan Siddiqui, whose studio made the Rahul Gandhi Gully Boy video.

Sixteen-year-old Hasnain Sheikh started making political spoofs as an escape from boredom. The schoolboy from Balasinor city near Ahmedabad made his first video on his mobile phone, which by his own admission was of terrible quality. But it got a lakh hits which made him sit up and get serious. His channel Spoof Xerox has since hosted parodies of Modi, Kejriwal and Akhilesh Yadav. “Anti-Modi videos get the most hits,’’ he says. Like Spoof Xerox, there are others like Politics Solitics and Hindi Mashup that are part of an ever growing spoof factory.

Akash Banerjee, a former journalist better known by his online avatar Bhakt Banerjee, boasts of half a million subscribers on his YouTube channel. Rather than merely lampooning or deifying leaders, Banerjee uses facts laced with dry humour to make his point. “Satire is powerful and I feel that it does influence votes. Hanste, hanste (While you are laughing) you make a deeper point, and if you can make someone see a divergent point of view, my job is done,” he says.

Banerjee says that a mainstream TV channel has expressed interest in hosting his videos indicating a growing acceptance of his brand of political critique.

So have Indians finally grown a funny bone? Or maybe comics have developed thicker skin? “People get abusive and threaten us. But I don’t get demoralised. I have realised that only people who don’t understand humour make negative comments,"" says Siddiqui.

Ram from Aisi Taisi feels that humour works better than rage. “Rage today is manufactured. Most people really don’t give a s***. 
Kissi ko itna rage na pehle hota than na aab (No one got so livid). It is just to discourage people from speaking up.’’ Siddiqui also feels that comics can influence political opinion. “
Comments padh kar lagta hai ke impact to padta hai (You realise you make an impact when you read the comments),"" he says. Ram, however, feels that influencing a vote would be a “reach”. “Satire can work as a rallying cry or a wake-up call. We are there to highlight the stupidities of society,’’ he says.

There are many reasons for the growing influence of political satire in India. For one, people have begun to question the integrity of mainstream media and celebrities, says Banerjee. The younger generation is also no longer interested in straitjacketed news. They would like it condensed and fact-checked, but raw and without baggage or bias. There is a large NRI audience as well that is invested in the country.

Are we moving towards the American tradition of late night satire where shows pack in factual news with tongue-in-cheek commentary? These are early days yet, feels Banerjee. But the satirist as a public intellectual is a role that some ‘’comics’’ are taking on. In a scathing comment on today’s politics, Kamra recounts an encounter with a politician who condescendingly tells him, ‘’Go ahead, do comedy but leave politics for us.’’ Kamra says,”Sir, 
aap pe hi chhoda tha. Par aap log comedy kar rahe ho (We had left the politics to you, but you started doing comedy).’’ The proof of the growing appetite for political comedy is in the numbers. US-based Indianorigin comic Hasan Minhaj recently dropped an episode on the Indian election that raked in 1.7 million views on YouTube in just four days. To put this in perspective, the only episode of his show ‘Patriot Act’ that has surpassed this was one where he described the power and fortunes of the Saudi royal family in light of the Washington Post correspondent Jamal Khashoggi killing, four months ago.

Banerjee says that platforms like You-Tube are not built for creators but for advertisers. ""Unfortunately, advertisers are scared of political content. If you talk of Dalit violence or cow lynching, it is not considered ad friendly,"" he says.

Right now, satirists can’t even imagine being free enough to speak openly, without the need to ‘’balance"" and criticise all political parties. Banerjee says, ""I work with the knowledge that I might be hounded or shut down any time. You can’t do what is being done in the late shows in the US. You will probably be shot dead if you did or said what they are doing.’

Mumbai youth lands Rs 1.2 crore job at Google's London office 

","
MUMBAI: Abdullah Khan (21) may have failed to crack the entrance for IITs, but he has bagged an offer that many IITians would envy. Early this week, Khan landed a job at Google's London office, for a package of Rs 1.2 crore. The average salary offered to a graduate from a non-IIT engineering college in the city is around Rs 4 lakh pa.


Khan, a student of Shree LR Tiwari Engineering College, Mira Road, was called for an interview by Google on the basis of a profile on a site that hosts competitive programming challenges.

After a few online interviews, Khan was asked to appear for the final screening at Google's office in London early this month.

His six-figure package includes the base salary of Rs 54.5 lakh (£60,000) per annum, 15 per cent bonus and stock options worth Rs 58.9 lakh ($85,000) over four years. Khan, who is doing his final year BE (computer science), will join Google's site reliability engineering team in September.

An email from a Google official in November last year mentioned that they had seen Khan's profile on the programming site, and said they were looking for people for locations across Europe.

Khan told TOI he was not expecting such an offer when he participated in competitions on that site. ""I used to participate as it was fun. I did not even know that firms check programmers' profiles on such sites. I showed the email to my friend who knew someone who had received such an email in the past. I am looking forward to joining their team. It will be an amazing learning experience for me,"" said Khan. The coding junkie did his schooling in Saudi Arabia and moved to Mumbai only after Class XII.

After 30 years, ‘Capt Rohan’ takes playschool teacher on a flight to Chicago - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Sudha Satyan was settling in her seat on Air India’s long-haul flight from Delhi to Chicago on Sunday, when the announcement of the captain’s name took her 30 years down memory lane. As a young playschool teacher, she had come across a 3-year-old who had introduced himself as “Captain” Rohan Bhasin. Today, he was actually in the plane's cockpit.


Once settled, she requested the airhostess to meet the pilot. When he came to meet her, the former playschool teacher hugged her grown-up “Captain”, tears in her eyes. 

Rohan’s mother took to Twitter later in the day to share their unique moment. She shared two photos of the pilot and his teacher, one from 1990-91 and another from Sunday.



#WarmsTheCocklesOfMyHeart.... During Playschool admission, the teacher asked my son his name. Nonchalantly he ans… https://t.co/gmiTSElLUs— Nivedita Bhasin (@nivedita_bhasin) 1553456292000
“#WarmsTheCocklesOfMyHeart.... During Playschool admission, the teacher asked my son his name. Nonchalantly he answered, ‘Capt Rohan Bhasin’. And he was just 3. And today, the same teacher was enroute to Chicago. And he was indeed the Captain. #StudentTeacherReunion,” she tweeted.

Captain Rohan's early romance with the skies was fuelled by a rich family history. His grandfather, Captain Jai Dev Bhasin, was among the first seven pilots in the country to become a commander in 1954. Rohan’s parents were with the erstwhile Indian Airlines, and now fly AI’s Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

Rohan started his pilot training after Class 12, and started his in-air experience as a co-pilot in 2007. His sister, Niharika, also became a pilot and married a colleague.

Satyan used to run the play school in Mumbai. Her husband was an engineer with AI, and they were in close contact with the Bhasins during their time in Mumbai.

'Nyay' scheme poses 'fiscal challenge' to India's economy: Arvind Panagariya - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: Former Niti Aayog vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya has said the implementation of the Congress Party's ambitious 'Nyay' scheme not only poses a ""fiscal challenge"" to India's economy but also has a ""serious incentive problem"".


Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said that its minimum income guarantee scheme, 'Nyuntam Aay Yojana' (Nyay) assures up to Rs 72,000 a year or Rs 6,000 a month income to 20 per cent of India's poorest families if the party is voted back to power in the Lok Sabha elections next month.



We will 'remonetise' what Modi 'demonetised', says Rahul GandhiRahul Gandhi on Thursday said the 'Nyay' scheme will remonetise what PM Modi demonetised and asserted that his party's anti-poverty programme has thrown the BJP into total disarray. The Congress president said the 'Nyay' scheme has the twin objectives of giving money to the 20% poorest families and remonetising the economy ""damaged"" by demonetisation.


Panagariya, who served as the first vice-chairman of Niti Aayog for two years from 2015 to 2017, told PTI that 'Nyay' is difficult to implement and unlikely to achieve its intended objective.

""It raises three major questions - the incentive compatibility issue, the fairness issue and fiscal challenge,"" Panagariya, an eminent Indian-American economist, said.

But Gandhi said the 'Nyay' scheme has the twin objectives of giving money to the 20 per cent poorest families and remonetising the economy damaged by the demonetisation in 2016.

Its aim is two-fold. First is to guarantee a minimum income to the bottom 20 per cent families. The second is to remonetise the economy that has been demonetised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gandhi told PTI.

Senior Congress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram on Wednesday said 'enough' economists and experts had been consulted and they broadly agreed that India has the capacity to implement the scheme.

Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has said the implementation of the scheme is possible, Chidambaram said.

""Our calculation shows that it will not cross 2 per cent of the GDP, it will be 1.8 per cent of the GDP at any given point of time,"" he said.

Commenting on the scheme, Panagariya said the transfer is meant to be Rs 6,000 per month per family to 50 million families and at the same time, it also guarantees an income of Rs 12,000 per month to these families.

""What happens if one family has an income of only Rs 4,000 and another Rs 8,000 per month? Will the former then receive Rs 8,000 and the latter Rs 4,000 per month? If so, why should anyone with income below 12,000 do any work at all since their incomes will be Rs 12,000 regardless of what they earn?"" he asked.

Interpreted this way, ""there is a serious incentive problem with the scheme"", Panagariya asserted.

""If the scheme is meant to transfer flat Rs 6,000 per month to identified families regardless of the family's earned income, you cannot deliver Rs 12,000 per month to families earning less than Rs 6,000,"" he asserted.

The programme, as announced by the Congress, guarantees Rs 12,000 per month in income to the poor, which is Rs 144,000 per year, he said, explaining the fairness issue.

Add to it all other in-kind transfers: subsidised food, NREGA wages, free house, free toilet, free education and Rs 500,000 free health insurance coverage. The gross sum will be close to Rs 200,000 per year, Panagariya observed.

""Now think of someone not covered by the scheme and earning Rs 300,000 per year. This family will have to pay Rs 2,500 in taxes (currently covered by a tax credit but in principle taxable). How fair is this to those working?

""Moreover, taxpayers are all in urban areas and dole recipients all in rural areas. Will this not open a serious rural-urban schism? No one questions helping the destitute on the margin but when help is given to give all comforts of life free, those paying for those comforts will become intensely unhappy,"" he said.

Then there is the question of fiscal challenge, he said.

If Rs 12,000 per month per household is to be guaranteed to bottom 20 per cent of the population, even the average Rs 6,000 per family will be insufficient, he argued.

""But let us set that problem aside. Can we scrape Rs 3.6 trillion per year (calculated at Rs 6,000 per family for 50 million households)? There is no chance.

""It is 13 per cent of the proposed total central government expenditure in budget 2019-20,"" Panagariya said.

Anit Mukherjee, a policy fellow at the Center for Global Development where he works on issues of governance, public finance and service delivery in developing countries, said how to identify the target beneficiaries and how to absorb the fiscal impact are two major problems.

The amount is substantial, more than the current government has proposed (Rs 6,000 per year), and to a general definition of the poorest of the poor (and not just farmers), he said.

""However, it is about half of what a similar scheme in Kenya through a US-based charity GiveDirectly provides to over 20,000 adults purely on a universal basic income criteria,"" Mukherjee said, adding the results of the scheme are still awaited, so there is no firm global evidence on whether Universal Basic Income works or not at the scale which the programme in India would operate on.

According to Mukherjee, to address the problem of fiscal impact, there has to be ""cutbacks"" in other subsidies, principally food, fuel, electricity and fertiliser.

""Some transfers to the poorest of the poor, such as MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) and social pensions, would probably have to be absorbed into NYAY,"" Mukherjee told PTI.

Schemes such as Public Distribution System and MGNREGA are constitutionally mandated and it would be hard to remove them altogether, he said.

The Centre, which has struggled to contain the fiscal deficit, will have to foot the entire bill so the fiscal concern is justified, Mukherjee said.

'Turbanator' Harbhajan recalls India's historic victory against Australia in 2001 

","
Offie Harbhajan Singh talks to Dwaipayan Datta about his career changing 15-wicket haul at Chepauk against Australia that gave India one of their most memorable Test series wins ever.

I was relaxing in my room at the Chennai Super Kings team hotel a day ahead of our IPL opener (March 23) at Chepauk when I got a WhatsApp message of a YouTube clip of a young sardar running with his bat over his head to complete a second run for an Indian team from another era. The friend who sent it to me added a line: ""
Bhai, 18 years!""

It still feels like yesterday, when we won the Test match against Steve Waugh's Australia here to complete the famous series win. Yes, I got 15 wickets (7/133 and 8/84, 32 for the series), it changed my life and the Turbanator was born. But it was those two runs, I took off Glenn McGrath in the second innings to ensure the two-wicket win, which still give me goosebumps. We were chasing 155 and I was praying I wouldn't have to bat. But after tea on Day 5, wickets fell in a heap and I had to go out there with four runs to go... But that was the climax, let's start from the beginning.


Eden Gardens high

We came to Chennai on the back of a memorable Test win at Eden Gardens. After losing badly in Mumbai, VVS Laxman's 281 and Rahul Dravid's 180 turned it around for us at Eden. Yes, I, too, got 13 wickets and suddenly the whole country was looking at me as the match-winner that they were missing in the absence of an injured Anil Kumble. I have learned a lot bowling with Anil bhai, but I still thank him (in jest) for getting injured before the series. The world probably wouldn't have known me if he was fit.

There was a bit of chatter around me before I was selected for the series. I had problems at the National Cricket Academy and was suspended briefly. Then there were issues with my action, which were dealt with, but most importantly, I had lost my father just before the series.

Ahead of the series, I picked 28 wickets in four Ranji games and during a camp at the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai, there was a session where bowlers had to hit one stump. I did it more frequently than the others and probably that's why I got the call. Once the series began, things started falling into place at Eden Gardens, I got the first-ever hat-trick for India in Test cricket and consequently we won.




Dada loses another toss

I have a lot of respect for Dada, but somehow he just couldn't win tosses on Indian pitches, where the ball started doing a bit for the spinners after the third day. It was no different at Chepauk, where we were playing with three spinners (debutant leggie Sairaj Bahutule, inexperienced left-arm spinner Nilesh Kulkarni and a 20-year-old me). The ball wasn't doing much and Matthew Hayden was in an absolutely punishing mood. I have bowled to many batsmen, but hardly has anyone been more intimidating than Hayden. In addition to that I dropped Hayden once when he was closing in on a double ton, but it didn't cost us much, though Haydos still made the landmark. In that innings, I remember Steve Waugh, who hardly ever put a foot wrong, handling the ball of my bowling and the ball wasn't even close to the wicket. I didn't know it could be a mode of dismissal, and understood only when Rahul and Dada appealed and got the decision. Waugh was batting so well, it was game-changing!


Back and forth

We batted well and got a lead of more than 100, but Australia counter-attacked. My most memorable scalp of the eight in the second innings was definitely Steve Waugh's. He was unbeaten when Australia went out to bat on the fifth morning and if he had carried on longer, they might have won the game. I got that bounce from the Chepauk track, it also turned a bit, and Waugh was caught at forward short-leg.

I got Ponting in both innings, he was probably over-thinking while facing me. He didn't know what to do and in those days, he had a habit of jabbing at the ball hard early on. I made the most of it and got him out.


So close, yet...

Those days, after my bowling session, I used to stay quiet in the dressing room and keep looking at the seniors. Their body language suggested belief after we had got Australia cheaply in the second innings, but my god, this was some Australia... At tea, with Laxman at the crease, we thought we had won, but VVS got out soon after, courtesy a stunning catch by Mark Waugh. Chepauk went completely quiet and the tension was unbearable as more wickets fell. It was probably god's will that I get those last four runs. When I look at the YouTube video now, I remember I was expecting a bouncer from McGrath when we needed two. But he tried yorking me and I just put bat to ball. He had removed the point before bowling that delivery and the ball went just there as I ran for life.


Aftermath

It's a bit of blur afterwards. I remember the ovation I got from the fans. A few wanted to talk to me, but in those days I couldn't speak anything other than Hindi and Punjabi. Conversation wasn't possible, but the language I communicated with them was cricket. So many years have gone by, I have come to Chennai so many times, I have won Champions League here as Mumbai Indians captain as well (in 2011). The affection the fans have for me hasn't gone down one bit and now, at the fag end of my career, I would love to play a part and give them the gift that they so dearly love - the IPL trophy.



 THE KNOCK-OUT PUNCH

India beat Australia in the 3rd Test at Chepauk (played from March 18-22, 2001). Here are the highlights

Australia won the toss, Hayden got 203 and Australia was bowled out for 391. Harbhajan took 7/133

India piled up 501, Tendulkar (125) getting his 25th Test ton. Laxman (65) and Dravid (81) contributed handsomely

Harbhajan was the wrecker-in-chief in the second innings, getting 8/84 as Australia folded for 264. With 15 wickets, Harbhajan had the second-best match haul for India in Test cricket, after Narendra Hirwani's 16 (against West Indies)

India almost made a mess of a 155-run target despite Laxman's 66. But debutant keeper Samir Dighe held fort and Harbhajan got the final runs

Donald Trump: Google CEO Sundar Pichai committed to US, not Chinese military

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump said he met with the chief executive of Alphabet Inc's Google on Wednesday and discussed ""political fairness"" and the company's business in China.


""He stated strongly that he is totally committed to the US Military, not the Chinese Military,"" Trump said on Twitter of his meeting with Google CEO Sundar Pichai.

""Also discussed political fairness and various things that @Google can do for our Country. Meeting ended very well!,"" Trump said.

Google also issued a statement on the meeting.

""We were pleased to have productive conversations with the President about investing in the future of the American workforce, the growth of emerging technologies and our ongoing commitment to working with the US government,"" a Google spokesperson said in the statement.

""We are not working with the Chinese military. We are working with the US government, including the Department of Defense, in many areas including cybersecurity, recruiting and healthcare,"" the spokesperson said.

The top US general, marine general Joseph Dunford, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, told a Senate committee hearing earlier this month that the Chinese military was benefiting from the work Google was doing in China.

The US military said that Dunford met Pichai on Wednesday at the Pentagon at Google's request.

""General Dunford shared his concerns about US tech firms working in China and the potential impact on the United States' ability to maintain a competitive military advantage due to intellectual property being indirectly shared with the Chinese military,"" Colonel Patrick Ryder, a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said.

Pichai has said Google has invested in China for years and plans to continue to do so.

In a tweet last week, Trump accused social media platforms Facebook, Google's YouTube and Twitter of favoring his Democratic opponents over him and his fellow Republicans and said he would look into the issue.

Will only IITs lead the way in SPARC scheme - Times of India

","
Out of 282 research proposals, almost half of the projects chosen in the first phase were submitted by IITs
In 2018, Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration (SPARC) was launched with an aim to improve the overall research ecosystem in the country, including private institutions. However, strict eligibility criteria made the scheme restrictive with only the country's premier institutes benefitting from it.

This year, out of a total of 282 research proposals made under the scheme, 151 from various IITs of the country have been selected in the first phase. One research proposal each from Delhi University, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Aligarh Muslim University and Tata Institute of Social Sciences are also among the selected projects.





 ""Based on the merit of proposals, IITs will get the majority of initial SPARC funding. Mid-level institutes will come in the forefront only after they collaborate more, strengthen their faculty and researches,"" said Timothy A Gonsalves, director, IIT Mandi. Institutes not as established as IITs or NITs in terms of infrastructure and research facilities are still dependent on collaborative researches with premier institutes. ""The criteria for the first phase did not allow middle-range institutes to compete. At the moment, the scheme will target the overall research scenario through collaborative projects. But, gradually in the upcoming phases, other institutes might be able to participate directly,"" said Adrijit Goswami, professor, IIT Kharagpur and joint national coordinator for SPARC scheme.

""Initially, the premier institutes such as IITs, NITs will lead the way for average performing institutes because of eligibility and quality benchmarks. As Indian institutes ranked within the bracket of overall top-100 are eligible to submit proposals, it automatically takes a number of institutions out of the league,"" adds Gonsalves. Seven faculty-led projects have been selected from IIT Mandi for the first phase of SPARC scheme.

Gonsalves credits the institute's strong foreign collaborations for the selected proposals. ""Currently, students' participation is limited but PhD level students will get an opportunity to work at foreign universities for a period of three months to one year, which will be funded through the SPARC grants. Also, a considerable amount of the research grant will be spent on getting faculty and researchers to India from foreign universities,"" added Gonsalves.

Lok Sabha elections: How BJP beats Congress in turning votes into seats

","
Much of BJP's dominance in electoral politics in the past five years has been credited to PM Modi and party chief Amit Shah. While the duo did lead BJP to a sweeping majority in 2014, the ground for that may have been laid much before their time.


Analysis of election data from 1996 to 2009, including the two terms of the Congress-led UPA, shows that the strike rate of BJP contestants was far better than those fielded by the grand old party. The percentage of BJP candidates winning was higher in all but one election (2009), including in 2004 when the UPA-I assumed office.

That Congress also fielded more candidates than BJP could have affected its winning percentage, but as experts explain, ""BJP's success in building a national narrative had been in the pipeline since 1992"".




Veteran BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa told TOI: ""Narendra Modi was a Gujarat CM and was working in that capacity for the party. But from the time of Vajpayee, we worked across the breadth and length of this country with leaders like Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi, and at a time all this was taking a more concrete shape, Modi was projected as the PM candidate and naturally it got converted into votes.""

1n 1999, when the BJP-led NDA came to power under Vajpayee, 57% of BJP candidates had won, against 25% from the rival party.

In 1996, 34% of all BJP contestants won, compared to 26% of Congress candidates; in 2004, when UPA eventually formed the government, 38% of BJP candidates won, against 35% for Congress. In 1998 and 1999, when NDA ruled, BJP candidates had a much higher winnability record compared to Congress.

""You can map the timeline of how we grew from Gujarat and Rajasthan to Karnataka and the northeast. It was between 1996 and 1998 that the party emerged nationally. In 2014, we did reach the peak as there was 'partial consolidation' because of the spiralling growth of the middle class and youth which came in handy,"" BJP spokesperson Krishna Sagar Rao said.

At a discussion last month, psephologists spoke of how the 2014 LS polls were critical in setting the ground for a narrative on New India. ""If BJP comes back to power you will see this narrative getting stronger by 2024. But even if the party fails to retain power, the idea won't die, such was the nature of the elections in 2014,"" said Suhas Palshikar.

""India Shining may not have worked for BJP electorally in that year (2004), but the exercise of building a national narrative that has engaged people had begun and that was the first attempt. Today, the Naya Bharat campaign is not just a linguistic nuance but a sustained effort at consolidation,"" Palshikar said.

RCB vs MI no ball controversy: ​​Twitter erupts as umpiring error mars RCB-MI thriller 

","
NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians clinched a 6-run win in a nail-biting final-over thriller against Royal Challenger Bangalore at the M.Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Thursday. But victory for the Rohit Sharma-led side was overshadowed by an umpiring howler. With RCB needing 7 runs off the final ball, the umpire missed the overstepping from Lasith Malinga and MI secured the win.


Soon after the match a fuming Virat Kohli went all-out against the umpiring error. 

""We are playing at IPL level, not club cricket ... that's just a ridiculous call off the last ball. the umpires should have their eyes open, it was a no-ball by an inch. it's a completely different game altogether. so if it's a game of margins, I don't know what's happening. They should have been more sharp and more careful out there,"" said Kohli after the match. 

Social media too went berserk after replays clearly showed that the front foot of Malinga on the final ball was way over the line.

Chasing a daunting target of 188, RCB needed 17 off the last over. Shivam Dubey (9 off 5 balls) and AB De Villiers (70 off 41 balls) were in the middle for the home team and brought the equation down to 7 required of the last ball. 

Had umpire declared the final ball from Malinga an illegal delivery, RCB then, would have got an extra run and a free-hit as well.

But the howler from the umpire helped Mumbai Indians register their first win and handed RCB their second defeat of the season.

Mars had big rivers for billions of years: Study - Times of India

","
NEW YORK: Mars' rivers flowed intensely and may have persisted as recently as one billion years ago, reveals a survey that found that the red planet's rivers were wider than those on Earth today.


The study by scientists at the University of Chicago catalogued these rivers and found that significant river runoff persisted on Mars later into its history than previously thought.

According to the study, published in the Science Advances journal, the runoff was intense and occurred at hundreds of locations on the red planet.

These findings suggest that climate-driven precipitation may have taken place on Mars even during the time that researchers think the planet was losing its atmosphere and was drying out.

This complicates the picture for scientists trying to model the ancient martian climate, said lead author Edwin Kite, Assistant Professor at the University of Chicago.

""It's already hard to explain rivers or lakes based on the information we have. This makes a difficult problem even more difficult,"" he said.

But, Kite said, the constraints could be useful in winnowing the many theories that researchers have proposed to explain the climate.

The survey used image data of well-preserved paleo-river channels, alluvial fans and deltas across Mars, and calculated the intensity of river runoff using multiple methods, including an analysis of the size of the river channels.

In the river basins, for which there is most data, Mars' rivers were about two times wider than those on Earth.

Between 1 and 3.6 billion years ago, and likely after 1 billion years ago, there was intense runoff in these channels, amounting to 3 to 20 kg per square metre each day.

The runoff appeared to have been distributed globally, and was not a short-lived or localised phenomenon, the researchers said.

If the dates for these massive rivers are correct, the findings could suggest that Mars' late-stage atmosphere disappeared faster than previously calculated, or that there were other drivers of precipitation under low-atmosphere conditions, the researchers noted.

MIT Vishwashanti Gurukul School hikes fee, parents protest - Times of India

","
PUNE: Parents of students studying at MIT Vishwashanti Gurukul School, Kothrud, on Saturday protested against the 15% fee hike by the school authorities. 


They also protested against the administration’s decision to switch over to CBSE board from the state board and imposition of late fee amounting to Rs 100 per week.

According to the parents, the decision to increase the fee was taken by the administration without approval from the Parents Teachers Association. “When the school had proposed to increase the fee by 15%, we were ready to accept it, provided they justified it by showing us the balance sheet of the school, which they have refused till date. Finally, in February, we paid the old fee for 2018-19. However, soon the students received a notice from the school telling them to pay the remaining amount.





 “The original primary school fee was about Rs 19,000 while the secondary fee was around Rs 22000, which we have paid. Why should we pay the fee hike which has not been approved by the EPTA yet? It is a government rule that the late fee can only be Re 1 per day after 365 days of non-payment. Why is the school asking for Rs 100 per week?” said a parent.

 Ms Madhuri Gokhale, principal of the school said, ""The fee increase has been done legally. We had applied for 15% hike to District Fee Regulation Committee because by rule the school can do so in two year's interval. The decision from DFRC is pending but till the decision comes, the rule says we can go ahead with the new fee. If the decision is against us, we will return the fee to respective parents. The Rs 100/ week late fee was approved in the ePTA meeting held last July. As far as switching affiliation to CBSE is considered, we have submitted the documents and we are expecting a committee to come and inspect the school. If parents have a problem, they can leave the school and join any other state board school of their choice.""

Madhuri further said that the parents blocked her way and pushed her, post which police was called to the school. She has also filed a complaint (NC) with the police station against the parents for manhandling her.

MI vs RCB 2019: Umpires should keep their eyes open, this is not club cricket, says Virat Kohli; Rohit Sharma agrees 

","
BANGALORE: An angry Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Virat Kohli came down heavily on ICC Elite Panel Umpire S Ravi after the final delivery of the match bowled by Mumbai Indians' Lasith Malinga turned out to be a 'no-ball', which was not awarded to the losing team.


More importantly, winning captain Rohit Sharma was also critical of umpiring standard during the match.

""We are playing at the IPL level. It's not club level, the umpires should have their eyes open. That was a big no-ball. That is a ridiculous call (last ball). If it is a game of margins, I don't know what is happening. They should have been more sharp and careful out there,"" a livid Kohli said at the post-match presentation ceremony.

Incidentally, Ravi is the only Indian umpire in ICC's Elite Panel for a number of years now as none of the others have been good enough to be elevated.

Needing 7 to win and six to take it to Super Over, Malinga's full toss yielded only one run but the big screen replay showed that the bowler had overstepped and a free hit should have been awarded.

Had it been a free-hit, AB de Villiers batting on 70 would have faced with five needed to win.

""We should have done a better job with the ball after they were seven down. The last few overs were brutal for us. Bit of a mistake from me to take Bumrah on at that time. Bumrah makes a hell of a difference in any team,"" the RCB skipper praised his India teammate.

Winning captain Rohit also voiced his concerns about umpiring.

""Honestly, I just go to know after crossing the rope that it was a no-ball. These kind of mistakes aren't good for the game. The over before that Bumrah bowled, a ball which wasn't a wide but it was called,"" Rohit referred to a decision given by other umpire C Nandan.

""Anything over 180 you can fight with. It wasn't a safe score but we had the bowlers to get the job done. Even though Virat and AB had a partnership going, we didn't panic. I thought we stuck to our plans, it was a great effort by the bowlers. Should have got 200 with the bat on this pitch.""

Narendra Modi: India successfully shoots down Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite in space 

","
NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday destroyed a low-orbiting satellite in a missile test that puts the country in the space ""super league"", Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in an address to the nation.


""In the journey of every nation there are moments that bring utmost pride and have a historic impact on generations to come. One such moment is today,"" he said in an unprecedented broadcast to the nation on television, radio and social media.



'Mission Shakti': India's first anti-satellite missile system that destroyed a LEO satelliteLow earth orbit or LEO satellites are used for telecommunication that orbit till a distance of around 2,000 kilometers above the earth's surface. These satellites are also used for data communication for instance e-mail, video conferencing, etc. These satellites move at extremely high speeds and are not fixed in space in relation to the earth.

""India has successfully tested the Anti-Satellite (ASAT) Missile. Congratulations to everyone on the success of #MissionShakti,"" the Prime Minister tweeted later.He said the action was not directed against any country and the satellite was a pre-determined target orbiting at an altitude of 300km.

The Prime Minister did not say who owned the satellite but added that India does not breach any international laws or treaties.

Mission Shakti, which was led by the Defence Research and Development Organisation, was aimed at strengthening India's overall security, he said in his address that comes a fortnight before the start of the general election.

""#MissionShakti was a highly complex one, conducted at extremely high speed with remarkable precision. It shows the remarkable dexterity of India's outstanding scientists and the success of our space programme,"" Modi said.



'Mission Shakti' and ASAT missile test: All you need to knowPrime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Wednesday that India successfully targeted a live satellite on low earth orbit. The missile test has put India in the space ""super league"". 

""Shooting down a low earth orbit satellite is a rare achievement for the country,"" he said.

India is only the fourth country to acquire such a specialised and modern capability after the US, Russia and China. The ""entire effort is indigenous. India's stands tall as a space power. It will make India stronger, even more secure and will further peace and harmony"", Modi said.

 The Prime Minister had advertised his address to the nation on Twitter, calling it an important message.



'Made presentations on A-SAT during UPA-II, did not get response,' says former DRDO chief VK Saraswat

""Do watch the address on television, radio or social media,"" he said, setting off speculation across the country on what the topic was likely to be.

Earlier in the day, the Cabinet Committee on Security had met at the Prime Minister's residence.

Much of BJP's dominance in electoral politics in the past five years has been credited to PM Modi and party chief Amit Shah. While the duo did lead BJP to a sweeping majority in 2014, the ground for that may have been laid much before their time.


Analysis of election data from 1996 to 2009, including the two terms of the Congress-led UPA, shows that the strike rate of BJP contestants was far better than those fielded by the grand old party. The percentage of BJP candidates winning was higher in all but one election (2009), including in 2004 when the UPA-I assumed office.

That Congress also fielded more candidates than BJP could have affected its winning percentage, but as experts explain, ""BJP's success in building a national narrative had been in the pipeline since 1992"".




Veteran BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa told TOI: ""Narendra Modi was a Gujarat CM and was working in that capacity for the party. But from the time of Vajpayee, we worked across the breadth and length of this country with leaders like Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi, and at a time all this was taking a more concrete shape, Modi was projected as the PM candidate and naturally it got converted into votes.""

1n 1999, when the BJP-led NDA came to power under Vajpayee, 57% of BJP candidates had won, against 25% from the rival party.

In 1996, 34% of all BJP contestants won, compared to 26% of Congress candidates; in 2004, when UPA eventually formed the government, 38% of BJP candidates won, against 35% for Congress. In 1998 and 1999, when NDA ruled, BJP candidates had a much higher winnability record compared to Congress.

""You can map the timeline of how we grew from Gujarat and Rajasthan to Karnataka and the northeast. It was between 1996 and 1998 that the party emerged nationally. In 2014, we did reach the peak as there was 'partial consolidation' because of the spiralling growth of the middle class and youth which came in handy,"" BJP spokesperson Krishna Sagar Rao said.

At a discussion last month, psephologists spoke of how the 2014 LS polls were critical in setting the ground for a narrative on New India. ""If BJP comes back to power you will see this narrative getting stronger by 2024. But even if the party fails to retain power, the idea won't die, such was the nature of the elections in 2014,"" said Suhas Palshikar.

""India Shining may not have worked for BJP electorally in that year (2004), but the exercise of building a national narrative that has engaged people had begun and that was the first attempt. Today, the Naya Bharat campaign is not just a linguistic nuance but a sustained effort at consolidation,"" Palshikar said.

Jet Airways News: Planes grounded, Jet Airways sends expat pilots on leave without pay 

","
NEW DELHI: 

  Jet Airways
 + has started sending its pilots - most likely only the expats - on furloughs, or leaves without pay. Expat pilots cost nearly twice as much as their Indian counterparts as they have to be given accommodation and flight tickets to their home country every few weeks. Since Jet is now operating 35 of its once-upon-a-time fleet of 124 planes, the lender-led management has begun cutting this extra cost. The airline is trying to take this number to 75 by April 26, still leaving it pilot surplus.


Sources say only expat pilots are being sent on furlough. Despite repeated attempts, Jet did not comment on how many expats it has and if the offer is being made to them only. 



With just one-fourth of operational fleet, Jet suspends services to 13 international routes till end-AprilJet Airways has suspended operations on 13 more international routes till end-April and grounded seven more planes due to non-payment of rentals, taking the number of such aircraft to 54. The airline has also reduced frequencies on seven other overseas routes, mostly from Delhi and Mumbai. From 600 daily flights operations reduced to one-fourth.


""Due to the reduced network and fleet plan, the company's pilot requirements on your fleet have reduced and your services will not be required… as an interim arrangement, we are offering furlough to pilots. Accordingly, we hereby offer you furlough of your employment with effect from April 01, 2019 till further notice,"" a letter issued to an expat pilot of Boeing 737 on Thursday said.

""Please consider this letter as notice to furlough your employment with us. We will periodically assess pilot requirements and advise you accordingly,"" it adds. During the furlough, pilots will not not receive salary, any other monetary benefit, accommodation and medical insurance. 

""However, you will continue to be eligible for free passages as per the prevailing staff travel policy of the company. You shall maintain recency / validity of your licenses / medical during the period of furlough. In case your employment contract ceases during the term of this furlough arrangement, the furlough arrangement contemplated herein shall automatically come to an end on the date of cessation of the employment contract,"" the letter says.

In the last two months, Jet has seen several of its pilots leave. They along with aircraft engineers and senior management are awaiting payment of last three to four months' salaries. 

Expat pilots have always been a touchy issue in almost all Indian carriers. Last August when Jet had proposed 15 per cent pay cut for pilots, the airline had even then issued ad to hire expats. When Indian pilots questioned the move of cutting their salaries yet continuing to hire expats, the then management had said salary of expat pilots would also be deducted. The salary deduction move did not happen and the airline later was not in a position to pay salaries to the level of employees with big pay packages.

I felt like Stuart Broad when Yuvraj Singh walloped me for three successive sixes: Yuzvendra Chahal 

","
BENGALURU: Royal Challengers Bangalore spinner Yuzvendra Chahal said he felt like Stuart Broad when Mumbai Indians' veteran swashbuckler Yuvraj Singh smashed three sixes in one of his overs.


Yuvraj struck Chahal for consecutive sixes in the 14th over of the match which Mumbai won by six runs on Thursday night.


POINTS TABLE | 
SCHEDULE

""When he (Yuvraj) hit three sixes, I felt like Stuart Broad,"" Chahal said referring to the six consecutive maximums in the 2007 T20 World Cup that Yuvraj had hit off Englishman Broad.

However, Chahal managed to get Yuvraj off the fourth delivery of his over, caught by Mohammad Siraj in the deep after he had scored a quick-fire 23 off 12 balls.

""You know he is a legend batsman and I backed myself. I had to bowl a bit up, might be a chance to get him out because it is a smaller ground. So that time, I thought of bowling my best delivery and he got sixes. That you cannot help and hence I bowled a wider googly,"" he told reporters in post-match session.

On September 19, 2007, in a World T20 match in Durban, Yuvraj had scripted a carnage by walloping six sixes off Broad in an over during a 16-ball 58.

Speaking about the wicket, Chahal said since it was good for batting, he varied his pace, especially for the big-hitting Kieron Pollard.

""The wicket was not turning. It was good for batting. So, the plan was to vary my pace, like bowling slower ones and sometimes sliders too,"" he said.

India taking lead in setting timeline to eliminate single-use plastic: UN Environment acting head - Times of India

","
NAIROBI: UN Environment acting executive director Joyce Msuya congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi for taking the lead in putting a timeline to eliminate the consumption of single-use plastic by 2022. Still, the Indian government, she feels, needs to take tough decisions to confront the burning issue of air and water pollution. 


In an exclusive interview with TOI, Msuya spoke extensively about the environmental challenges faced by India, which, she stressed, can set an example to others in the region if it addresses these challenges urgently.

While plastic pollution has become a major concern worldwide, few nations have shown the resolve to tackle the issue. But on Friday, the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA), which concluded in Nairobi, reviewed a roadmap for a plastic-free planet. To reach this target, many countries, including India, have offered to share knowhow, and develop and implement legislation against the use of harmful single-use plastic and micro-plastics.

While talking about India's role in the South Asia region, Msuya said, ""With a large talented human capital and technological innovation, India has a big potential in resolving environmental issues. As India continues to play a leadership role in many segments, this is high time the country plays a leadership role in dealing with environmental challenges in the region.""

Msuya appreciated the civil society in India for working as a pressure group to address various environmental concerns. 

""I often travel to New Delhi and notice that there is a lot of awareness among people on rising air pollution. Civil society puts pressure on politicians as they are taxpayers or future taxpayers. They are continuously raising their voice for clean air and environmental protection. We also see that Indian citizens are quite enthusiastic on social media. Many times they use social media to press the authorities to save the environment and bring technological innovation to address environmental issues. All of this is a really positive sign,"" she said. 

Msuya relates very well to Indians battling with air pollution as she lived in Beijing for over three years. ""I moved to Beijing with my husband and children in 2011. When my son wanted to go out to play football, my job as a mother was to check the levels of PM2.5. Every morning, the first thing I used to do was to look at the temperature and the levels of PM2.5 (fine particulate matter). Air pollution used to influence my decision, whether my son should go out at all or if he should go out with a mask. The situation in China was really bad that time. However, things have changed in Beijing now and India can learn a lot from the Beijing experience,"" she said. 

The UN environment acting chief feels that three major factors - clear and targeted plans of the Government of China, strategical shifting of manufacturing units to different states, and huge engagement of the citizens demanding a call of action on pollution - helped China bring down air pollution in Beijing. 

According to Msuya, the UN's call for India is to bring a 'sense of urgency' to resolve environmental issues. ""The positive thing about India is that there is already an awareness and some policy decisions to tackle pollution. However, the government has to take extremely tough decisions. We encourage the Indian government to push for a sense of urgency. There have been reports that indicate the impact of pollution on health and budgets of the countries. Our call for India is therefore to speed up with what they have already started,"" she said. 

When asked how the UN is working on engaging India with other Asian nations over use of clean technology and green solutions, Msuya said, ""I lived in Asia for six years. When I was in South Korea, we used to host government delegations from both India and China to see and learn about an e-mass mobility system (electric buses). We can, therefore, certainly provide a platform where countries can learn from each other. Even though we recognise that India and China are very different culturally and politically, two countries can have research and peer-to-peer exchanges to tackle the problem of air, water and plastic pollution. Also, they can learn about policy innovation.""

In order to tackle most of the environmental concerns in India, Msuya suggested the country to engage the private sector to have technological innovative, clean alternatives; to involve mass media and civil society groups to spread awareness beyond big cities, and to have policy innovation. 

""You have dynamic entertainment industry Bollywood. Celebrities can come forward to not only spread awareness, but promote innovative solutions and press the authorities to have policy innovation.""

RJD Congress News: Congress-RJD friction delays Shatrughan Sinha entry 

","
PATNA/NEW DELHI: Tension erupted between Congress and RJD on Thursday, forcing them to cancel a press conference that had been scheduled to declare the names of 31 candidates of the anti-BJP front in Bihar.


The two partners, who had declared candidates for nine seats, locked horns again over Darbhanga, Bettiah and Supaul.

BJP rebel Shatrughan Sinha became the collateral victim of the flare-up. The former film star, an LS member from Patna Sahib, was expected to join Congress on Thursday. A press meet announcing that had to be cancelled.

Congress later released a picture of Sinha and Rahul Gandhi shaking hands, with the information that Sinha would join the party on April 6.

Hubble captures birth of giant storm on Neptune: Nasa - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: In a first, the Hubble Space Telescope has beamed back images documenting the birth of a giant storm on Neptune, a finding that may reveal insights on the inner workings of the poorly-understood ice giant planets, Nasa said.


Like Jupiter's Great Red Spot, Neptune's Great Dark Spots are storms that form from areas of high atmospheric pressure. In contrast, storms on Earth form around areas of low pressure.

Scientists have seen a total of six dark spots on Neptune over the years. Voyager 2 identified two storms in 1989. Since Hubble launched in 1990, it has viewed four more of these storms, Nasa said in a statement.

Researchers analysed Hubble's photos of the ice giant taken over the past several years and chronicled the growth of a new Great Dark Spot that became visible in 2018.

By studying companion clouds that showed up two years before the new Great Dark Spot, the researchers conclude dark spots originate much deeper in Neptune's atmosphere than previously thought.

The Hubble images also helped the researchers pinpoint how often Neptune gets dark spots and how long they last.

The findings not only give scientists insights on the inner workings of the ice giant planets but also have implications for studying exoplanets of similar size and composition.

""If you study the exoplanets and you want to understand how they work, you really need to understand our planets first,"" said Amy Simon, a planetary scientist at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in the US.

""We have so little information on Uranus and Neptune,"" said Simon, lead author of the study published in journal Geophysical Research Letters.

Scientists first saw a Great Dark Spot on Neptune in 1989, when Nasa's Voyager 2 probe flew past the mysterious blue planet. As the spacecraft zoomed by, it snapped pictures of two giant storms brewing in Neptune's southern hemisphere.

Scientists dubbed the storms ""The Great Dark Spot"" and ""Dark Spot 2.""

Just five years later, the Hubble Space Telescope took sharp images of Neptune that revealed both the Earth-sized Great Dark Spot and the smaller Dark Spot 2 had vanished.

A new Great Dark Spot appeared on Neptune in 2018, nearly identical in size and shape to the one Voyager saw in 1989.

Researchers were analysing Hubble images of a smaller dark spot that appeared in 2015 when they discovered small, bright white clouds in the region where the 2018 Great Dark Spot would later appear.

""We were so busy tracking this smaller storm from 2015, that we weren't necessarily expecting to see another big one so soon,"" Simon said.

The high-altitude clouds are made up of methane ice crystals, which give them their characteristic bright white colour.

Scientists suspect these methane clouds accompany the storms that form dark spots, hovering above them the way lenticular clouds cap tall mountains on Earth.

Indian-American Raja Krishnamoorthi 1st South Asian to serve on powerful committee on intel - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: Indian-American Democratic lawmaker Raja Krishnamoorthy has been appointed as a member of a Congressional committee on intelligence, becoming the first South Asian to serve in the powerful body tasked to strengthen America's national security.



Krishnamoorthy, 45, who represents Illinois's 8th congressional district in the house, was chosen along with Congresswoman Val Demings of Florida, Sean Patrick Maloney of New York and Peter Welch of Vermont as the four new Democratic members of the house permanent select committee on intelligence (HPSCI) for the 116th Congress.

The HPSCI is tasked with overseeing the activities and budget of the 17 intelligence agencies of the US.

Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi appointed Krishnamoorthi on Wednesday.

Pelosi said: ""Our new members of the intelligence committee bring exceptional judgment, expertise and determination to our mission to honour that oath and, guided by the strong, principled leadership of chairman Adam Schiff, will restore the long tradition of bipartisanship and integrity of this critical committee.

""We look forward to the many contributions these new members will bring to Democrats' work to strengthen America's national security and defend our democracy.""

Krishnamoorthi, after Pelosi announced his appointment, said: ""It is very humbling to be chosen to serve on the intelligence committee in this Congress, and I am ready to join with my colleagues in preserving the safety and security of our nation.""

""The intelligence challenges and international threats facing our country today are vast, ranging from terrorism to cyberwarfare to investigating Russia's previous and continuing attempts to sabotage our democracy.""

""I am honoured that the speaker and Caucus have placed their trust in me and the contributions I'll make to the committee. When I took the oath of office, I swore to protect and defend the Constitution from all threats, foreign and domestic, and I know that the work we do under the leadership of chairman Adam Schiff will fulfil that solemn duty,"" Krishnamoorthi said.

Born into a Tamil-speaking family in New Delhi, his family moved to Buffalo, New York when he was three months old.

Krishnamoorthi attended Princeton University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering. He also attended Harvard Law School.

Early this week, Pelosi appointed Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal to the house education and labour committee.

Priyanka Gandhi: Should I fight from Varanasi, Priyanka Gandhi asks party workers 

","
NEW DELHI: It was a stock query for 

  Priyanka Gandhi Vadra
 + , but one that elicited an unexpected answer. ""Varanasi se lad lun (should I contest from Varanasi?)"" - Priyanka's response to a party worker's query at a meeting in Rae Bareli on Thursday immediately set off fevered political speculation.


The comment is being interpreted in various ways. It could be mere repartee devoid of any deeper intent or could reveal a desire to take the electoral plunge. After all, it came a day after she answered the same question, saying that if the party felt so, she would be all too 

  happy to contest the election
 + .

The brief remark was enough to set a buzz and get the media interested, given that the temple town of Varanasi is the constituency of PM Narendra Modi.

According to reports, the comment came at a Congress workers' meeting in Rae Bareli fromn where Sonia Gandhi is to contest once again, with a group insisting that Priyanka fight the polls. The implied suggestion, a party source said, could be that she could step into her mother's shoes.

However, they were in for a shock when Priyanka turned back and asked how if she contested from Varanasi. While making it clear that she was open to contesting, she has also made it a point to add that her personal wish was to work for the party organisation as a lot of work had to be done.

Ever since Priyanka took the political plunge in January, the latest Gandhi to do so, there has been speculation if she would also make an electoral debut. With Sonia running again from her constituency and brother Rahul in Amethi, the possibility of her going to Varanasi ""to tie down the PM to his seat"" has been doing the rounds in party circles.

Priyanka's own allusion to Varanasi is set to stoke this speculation which, given its sensational implication, may set the political campaign abuzz. As the news spread, a party sympathiser claimed that even in 2014, Priyanka had toyed with the idea of taking on Modi, BJP's then prime ministerial nominee. However, the plan was shelved.

Given the charge of rejuvenating Congress in Uttar Pradesh, Priyanka is on a tour of the family turf of Amethi and Rae Bareli. She will visit Ayodhya on Friday before returning to the capital.

RBI: WhatsApp yet to comply with data localisation norms 

","
BENGALURU: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said that the popular messaging platform WhatsApp is not in compliance with the central bank’s data localisation norms in India. RBI’s comments come as response in an affidavit, reviewed by TOI, filed with the SC on Wednesday after the apex court made the central bank a party to a writ petition in January.


This is the first time the central bank has made an official statement on WhatsApp’s payments business and compliance with data localisation. WhatsApp, which is owned by social networking giant Facebook, has now been operating its payments business — WhatsApp Pay — in beta-mode for a year, restricted to one million users. The RBI also said it is exploring regulatory actions to expedite compliance of data localisation. However, it is being cautious to make sure a consumer’s transaction experience is not disrupted by any such measures. 




Centre for Accountability and Systemic Change, an NGO, had filed the petition challenging WhatsApp’s compliance standards and absence of a local grievance officer here. “As informed by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) on November 16, 2018 and February 5, 2019, WhatsApp is non-compliant with the RBI circular (on data localisation),” RBI’s response in the affidavit said. WhatsApp entered payments in India through Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which is run by NPCI. The original petition also challenged the Menlo Park-based company of non-payment of local taxes. 

The RBI has maintained that payments service providers and third-party payments app should follow its April 6 circular on data localisation, which mandates storage of key payments data only in India. The operative word here is — only — which payments companies had requested the RBI to omit. The RBI did not entertain the request.

Sources said WhatsApp’s newly appointed head for India — Abhijit Bose — recently met NPCI MD & CEO Dilip Asbe in Mumbai to discuss the regulatory concerns and hoping to accelerate the process of obtaining a final nod to roll out its payments service full-scale. For WhatsApp, India is its largest market with over 200 million monthly active users here. An email sent to WhatsApp India spokesperson did not elicit a response at the time of going to press. 

In October last year, WhatsApp said it built a system that stores payments-related data locally in India. NPCI, however, thought it was not enough since WhatsApp was merely mirroring or copying the payments data in India. It keeps the same in its overseas servers as well. 

Issues related to fake news and the government’s request to allow message traceability have only added to WhatsApp’s woes in India, ahead of general elections. TOI had previously reported how these non-payments issues have also emerged as a roadblock for the company’s payments operations here. To be sure, foreign payments players like Mastercard, Visa, Google and others are still in the process of complying with RBI’s data localisation guidelines. According to industry sources, these companies have given various timelines within 2019 by when they expect to be fully compliant with the norms.

vivo smartphone: Design innovations help Vivo become the fastest growing smartphone brand in India: Report - Times of India

","
Moving beyond the specs-price battle in the highly competitive Indian market, Chinese smartphone brand Vivo appears to be slowly emerging as one of the favourite in the country. Vivo is among the first to introduce design innovations in its phones like a popup selfie camera, in-display fingerprint scanner and a screen SoundCasting tech in which the display itself doubles up as a speaker. And it seems, this strategy to introduce design innovations across all price points is doing well for 
Vivo. 

Citing the latest market tracker report from research firm GfK, the company claimed itself as the fastest growing brand with 63.2% growth in terms of value and 60.9% growth in terms of volume in January 2019 versus January 2018. 

“We have a strong and diversified product portfolio in the Rs 8-10k, Rs 11-20k, Rs 20-25k and above Rs 30k segment to address the overall smartphone market in India. By launching devices in both the less than Rs 20K segment (Y series) and the Rs 20K plus segment (V series), we were able to secure 15.8% growth in terms of value and 13% growth in terms of volume, in Q4 of 2018, versus Q3 of 2018 despite the industry growing of merely 2.6 % and 5.2% in volume and value respectively (as per GfK),” said Nipun Marya, director, brand strategy, Vivo India. 

While rivals could negate this sudden growth, the brand seems to have positioned itself well in India. “We are focused on establishing itself as a long-term player in India with emphasis on providing innovative products. Owing to the right product mix, innovative marketing and robust distribution network, we have seen an encouraging growth over the last 4 years. As we gear up for our next growth phase, we have elevated our proposition from just music & camera to an ‘innovation lead’ brand and our products speak volumes for the same,” said Marya. 

Vivo recently flaunted a concept phone dubbed as Apex 2019, which doesn’t come with any port, button, selfie camera or even a SIM card slot. Dubbed as a ‘holeless phone’, Vivo thinks Apex could be the future -- a smartphone with just a display and no other distractions. 

“2019 will be the year Vivo will be recognized beyond than just a smartphone with a focus towards camera and music, but a brand that is fueled by innovation. We will bring products that deliver an extraordinary experience and will continue to provide product across price points. We are already the number 2 brand in the market in terms of value (as per GFK) and are confident that our growth will continue in the Indian market not just this but also in the coming years,” said Marya.

In Mumbai, kitten falls from balcony on seventh floor, lives to mew the tale 

","
KALYAN: Cats do have nine lives, it seems. A month-old kitten slipped off the seventh floor of a building in Ulhasnagar and, quite miraculously, escaped with a few minor injuries.

It was around Sunday midnight that the kitten, among a litter of five pets at the Kamaria family’s home, strayed into the balcony. The family has seven feline cats in their home.

It was only a little after midnight when a neighbour, who was in the building compound, knocked at their door and showed the family the kitten which he had just found outside the building. 

Quickly sizing up what had happened, the family at first gave it basic first aid before taking it to Vakratund Pet Clinic in Ulhasnagar. “The kitten seemed to be okay, but for some slight difficulty walking, said Khushboo Kamaria who takes care of the pets.

Dr Meghana Vadke, who examined and treated the kitten, said it not suffered any major injury. “Ordinarily, it is impossible for such a tiny cat to survive a fall from such a height, but this one seems to be an exception,” said Dr Vadke who had initially said it would have to be kept under observation for 24 hours but has now said it is out of danger. 

Khushboo and her brother Ajay are now thrilled to have the tiny ball of fur limping back to life. As a safety measure, their father, Rishi, has had the balcony sealed by putting up nets.

Food for mood: What you eat affects how you feel - Times of India

","
The patient, a 48-year-old real estate professional in treatment for anxiety and mild depression, revealed that he had eaten three dozen oysters over the weekend.


His psychiatrist, Dr Drew Ramsey, an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, was impressed: “You’re the only person I’ve prescribed them to who came back and said he ate 36!” Ramsey, the author of several books that address food and mental health, is a big fan of oysters. They are rich in vitamin B12, he said, which studies suggest may help to reduce brain shrinkage. They are also well stocked with long chain omega-3 fatty acids, deficiencies of which have been linked to higher risk for suicide and depression. Ramsey is a pioneer in the field of nutritional psychiatry, which attempts to apply what science is learning about the impact of nutrition on the brain and mental health.

Ramsey argues that a poor diet is a major factor contributing to the epidemic of depression, which is the top driver of disability for Americans aged 15 to 44, according to a report by the WHO.

The irony, he says, is that most Americans are overfed in calories yet starved of the vital array of micronutrients that our brains need, many of which are found in common plant foods. A survey published in 2017 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that only one in 10 adults meets the minimal daily federal recommendations for fruit and vegetables — at least one-and-a-half to two cups per day of fruit and two to three cups per day of vegetables.

Americans change what they eat in order to lose weight, control their blood sugar levels and lower artery-clogging cholesterol. But Ramsey says that it is still rare for people to pay attention to the food needs of the most complex and energy-consuming organ in the body — the human brain.

Research on the impact of diet on mental functioning is relatively new, and food studies can be difficult to perform and hard to interpret, since so many factors go into what we eat and our general well-being. But a study of over 12,000 Australians published in the ‘American Journal of Public Health’ in 2016 found that individuals who increased the number of servings of fruits and vegetables that they ate reported that they were happier and more satisfied with their life than those whose diets remained the same.

A Mediterranean diet, rich in whole grains, legumes and seafood as well as nutrientdense leafy vegetables that are high in fiber, promotes a diverse population of helpful bacteria in the gut. Research suggests that a healthy gut microbiome may be important in the processing of neurotransmitters like serotonin that regulate mood. Experts also recommend “eating the rainbow,” that is, consuming a wide array of colourful fruits and vegetables. Such foods are high in phytonutrients that may help to reduce harmful inflammation throughout the body, including the brain, and promote the growth of new brain cells throughout our adult years, they say.

Masood Azhar: US, China in bitter showdown at UN over sanctions on Masood Azhar 

","
The US and China seem headed for a showdown at the UN over Jaish chief Masood Azhar with Beijing accusing Washington of ""forcefully moving"" a resolution in the Security Council intended to compel China to make public its reasons for stalling efforts to tag him as a ""global terrorist"".


With Beijing persisting with a ""technical hold"", preventing the sanctions committee of the UNSC from designating the Jaish-e-Muhammed chief as a terrorist, Washington has sought to raise the heat by seeking a discussion in the council - inviting a sharp Chinese retort that it should act with caution.

Acting with the support of France and the UK, the US bumped up the issue of listing Azhar on Wednesday.



China draws ire of other UNSC members for saving Jaish chief Masood AzharA day after Beijing used its veto to stall the sanctions committee’s near-unanimous decision to designate Azhar a terrorist, a Security Council diplomat said China should not prevent the UN panel from doing its job, and Beijing’s move to hold the listing was ""inconsistent with its own stated goals of combating terrorism and furthering regional stability in South Asia.""


The move came two weeks after China, for the fourth time, put a hold on a proposal to list him under the 1267 Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee of the council.

Never before has a terrorist of interest to India been targeted at the council in this manner. The other 14 members of the council are said to be supporting the proposed ban. 

Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said in Beijing that the 

  US was undermining the authority of the sanctions committee
 + . ""This is not in line with resolution of the issue through dialogue and negotiations. This has reduced the authority of the committee as a main anti-terrorism body of the UNSC and this is not conducive to the solidarity and only complicates the issue,"" Geng said.

""We urge the US to act cautiously and avoid forcefully moving forward this resolution draft,"" China said, using unusually blunt language as the Trump administration made good its expressed intent to take the JeM chief's issue to the UNSC since the sanctions committee had been repeatedly thwarted.

Adding to the friction was US secretary of state Mike Pompeo calling out the contradiction of China's forcible detention of Uighur Muslims while supporting terror groups like JeM. ""The world cannot afford China's shameful hypocrisy toward Muslims. On one hand, China abuses more than a million Muslims at home, but on the other, it protects violent Islamic terrorist groups from sanctions at the UN,"" Pompeo said.

The US resolve in pushing China reflects a determination to press down on Pakistan in the wake of the JeM claiming responsibility for the suicide bombing in Pulwama despite its efforts to withdraw from Afghanistan, a strategy that is seen to require the cooperation of Pakistan. Its cruciality to US plans is seen as a factor that emboldens the Pakistan military to ""sanction"" a big attack in J&K.

The US move means that China, if it doesn't lift the ""technical hold"", will likely have to explain publicly for the first time the rationale behind its support to the leader of a UN-designated terrorist group. It is understood that the next step for the council is to have informal discussions on the resolution.

Though China as a permanent member can veto the draft resolution in the UNSC, the development further isolates Beijing at a time when the international community is running out of patience with Pakistan's sponsorship of terrorism and China's decision to shield it. JeM's claim for the Pulwama attack only deepened the unease. Proceedings of the sanctions committee were in camera but a UNSC vote, if it comes to that, will be on record.

The US-China clash over Azhar came against the backdrop of Pompeo meeting a delegation of Uighur Muslims, tens of thousands of whom are said to have been corralled in internment camps as Beijing tries to staunch what it sees as Islamic radicalism.

If the council fails to arrive at a consensus, then it could consider putting the resolution to vote, leading to an open discussion. The US, France and the UK, which have worked together to bring the proposal, will hope in such a scenario that China, fearing isolation, abstains to allow the ban to go through.

RCB vs MI no ball controversy: ​​Twitter erupts as umpiring error mars RCB-MI thriller 

","
NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians clinched a 6-run win in a nail-biting final-over thriller against Royal Challenger Bangalore at the M.Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Thursday. But victory for the Rohit Sharma-led side was overshadowed by an umpiring howler. With RCB needing 7 runs off the final ball, the umpire missed the overstepping from Lasith Malinga and MI secured the win.


Soon after the match a fuming Virat Kohli went all-out against the umpiring error. 

""We are playing at IPL level, not club cricket ... that's just a ridiculous call off the last ball. the umpires should have their eyes open, it was a no-ball by an inch. it's a completely different game altogether. so if it's a game of margins, I don't know what's happening. They should have been more sharp and more careful out there,"" said Kohli after the match. 

Social media too went berserk after replays clearly showed that the front foot of Malinga on the final ball was way over the line.

Chasing a daunting target of 188, RCB needed 17 off the last over. Shivam Dubey (9 off 5 balls) and AB De Villiers (70 off 41 balls) were in the middle for the home team and brought the equation down to 7 required of the last ball. 

Had umpire declared the final ball from Malinga an illegal delivery, RCB then, would have got an extra run and a free-hit as well.

But the howler from the umpire helped Mumbai Indians register their first win and handed RCB their second defeat of the season.

Lucknow: Rapped for marks, runaway girl’s flight aborted 

","
LUCKNOW: Scolded by parents for scoring poor marks in her class 11 exams, a teen girl bought an online ticket to Mumbai and reached Amausi airport on Thursday to catch the flight.

 The minor was, however, intercepted by airline staff who noticed her suspicious behaviour and informed police. 

Sub-inspector (airport) Jag Prasad told TOI that he got a call from airline staff about a girl having an air ticket to Mumbai and looking suspicious. 

“I rushed with a lady constable to the airline counter and found the girl. We engaged her by offering her tea and biscuits. In the meanwhile, I got a call from control room about a missing girl from Para with similar attire,” he added. Police then informed the mother of the girl Parul (name changed). She rushed to the airport and began crying on seeing Parul with police at the airport. She told police that Parul sneaked away while she was busy talking to a relative at her residence. She admitted to have scolded her for scoring poor marks in two subjects in her exams. 

Parul told TOI that she had won Rs 5,000 in online game six months ago which she used to purchase an online air ticket via e-wallet. “I wanted to start earning and hence decided to go to Mumbai,” she told police.

Parul told police that a Facebook friend gave her the idea to go to Mumbai to start earning. 

The girl’s mother further said that her husband rides 50 km daily to work for Parul’s better future. “We also shelled out Rs 2,000 for her coaching,” she claimed. The police also counselled the girl’s mother to not scold her even if she scores poor marks further. 

They also told the girl not to flee from home again as it involves a lot of risk and can even imperil her life. The girl’s parents are employed in private sector. The Sarojininagar police then handed over the girl to her parents.

In 2016, a 14-year-old girl from Vikasnagar had fled to Mumbai after being scolded by her parents for scoring poorly in her final exams.

In 2018 also, a 15-year-old girl from Indiranagar had fled from her home after being scolded by her parents. In both cases of 2016 and 2018, police probe had revealed that a a closed user group on Facebook had lured the girls to travel to Mumbai.

'Turbanator' Harbhajan recalls India's historic victory against Australia in 2001 

","
Offie Harbhajan Singh talks to Dwaipayan Datta about his career changing 15-wicket haul at Chepauk against Australia that gave India one of their most memorable Test series wins ever.

I was relaxing in my room at the Chennai Super Kings team hotel a day ahead of our IPL opener (March 23) at Chepauk when I got a WhatsApp message of a YouTube clip of a young sardar running with his bat over his head to complete a second run for an Indian team from another era. The friend who sent it to me added a line: ""
Bhai, 18 years!""

It still feels like yesterday, when we won the Test match against Steve Waugh's Australia here to complete the famous series win. Yes, I got 15 wickets (7/133 and 8/84, 32 for the series), it changed my life and the Turbanator was born. But it was those two runs, I took off Glenn McGrath in the second innings to ensure the two-wicket win, which still give me goosebumps. We were chasing 155 and I was praying I wouldn't have to bat. But after tea on Day 5, wickets fell in a heap and I had to go out there with four runs to go... But that was the climax, let's start from the beginning.


Eden Gardens high

We came to Chennai on the back of a memorable Test win at Eden Gardens. After losing badly in Mumbai, VVS Laxman's 281 and Rahul Dravid's 180 turned it around for us at Eden. Yes, I, too, got 13 wickets and suddenly the whole country was looking at me as the match-winner that they were missing in the absence of an injured Anil Kumble. I have learned a lot bowling with Anil bhai, but I still thank him (in jest) for getting injured before the series. The world probably wouldn't have known me if he was fit.

There was a bit of chatter around me before I was selected for the series. I had problems at the National Cricket Academy and was suspended briefly. Then there were issues with my action, which were dealt with, but most importantly, I had lost my father just before the series.

Ahead of the series, I picked 28 wickets in four Ranji games and during a camp at the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai, there was a session where bowlers had to hit one stump. I did it more frequently than the others and probably that's why I got the call. Once the series began, things started falling into place at Eden Gardens, I got the first-ever hat-trick for India in Test cricket and consequently we won.




Dada loses another toss

I have a lot of respect for Dada, but somehow he just couldn't win tosses on Indian pitches, where the ball started doing a bit for the spinners after the third day. It was no different at Chepauk, where we were playing with three spinners (debutant leggie Sairaj Bahutule, inexperienced left-arm spinner Nilesh Kulkarni and a 20-year-old me). The ball wasn't doing much and Matthew Hayden was in an absolutely punishing mood. I have bowled to many batsmen, but hardly has anyone been more intimidating than Hayden. In addition to that I dropped Hayden once when he was closing in on a double ton, but it didn't cost us much, though Haydos still made the landmark. In that innings, I remember Steve Waugh, who hardly ever put a foot wrong, handling the ball of my bowling and the ball wasn't even close to the wicket. I didn't know it could be a mode of dismissal, and understood only when Rahul and Dada appealed and got the decision. Waugh was batting so well, it was game-changing!


Back and forth

We batted well and got a lead of more than 100, but Australia counter-attacked. My most memorable scalp of the eight in the second innings was definitely Steve Waugh's. He was unbeaten when Australia went out to bat on the fifth morning and if he had carried on longer, they might have won the game. I got that bounce from the Chepauk track, it also turned a bit, and Waugh was caught at forward short-leg.

I got Ponting in both innings, he was probably over-thinking while facing me. He didn't know what to do and in those days, he had a habit of jabbing at the ball hard early on. I made the most of it and got him out.


So close, yet...

Those days, after my bowling session, I used to stay quiet in the dressing room and keep looking at the seniors. Their body language suggested belief after we had got Australia cheaply in the second innings, but my god, this was some Australia... At tea, with Laxman at the crease, we thought we had won, but VVS got out soon after, courtesy a stunning catch by Mark Waugh. Chepauk went completely quiet and the tension was unbearable as more wickets fell. It was probably god's will that I get those last four runs. When I look at the YouTube video now, I remember I was expecting a bouncer from McGrath when we needed two. But he tried yorking me and I just put bat to ball. He had removed the point before bowling that delivery and the ball went just there as I ran for life.


Aftermath

It's a bit of blur afterwards. I remember the ovation I got from the fans. A few wanted to talk to me, but in those days I couldn't speak anything other than Hindi and Punjabi. Conversation wasn't possible, but the language I communicated with them was cricket. So many years have gone by, I have come to Chennai so many times, I have won Champions League here as Mumbai Indians captain as well (in 2011). The affection the fans have for me hasn't gone down one bit and now, at the fag end of my career, I would love to play a part and give them the gift that they so dearly love - the IPL trophy.



 THE KNOCK-OUT PUNCH

India beat Australia in the 3rd Test at Chepauk (played from March 18-22, 2001). Here are the highlights

Australia won the toss, Hayden got 203 and Australia was bowled out for 391. Harbhajan took 7/133

India piled up 501, Tendulkar (125) getting his 25th Test ton. Laxman (65) and Dravid (81) contributed handsomely

Harbhajan was the wrecker-in-chief in the second innings, getting 8/84 as Australia folded for 264. With 15 wickets, Harbhajan had the second-best match haul for India in Test cricket, after Narendra Hirwani's 16 (against West Indies)

India almost made a mess of a 155-run target despite Laxman's 66. But debutant keeper Samir Dighe held fort and Harbhajan got the final runs

Soon, early detection of epidemics with use of AI: Microbiologist who co-discovered Ebola - Times of India

","
HYDERABAD: Early detection of epidemics will be possible with better surveillance and use of artificial intelligence, said Professor Baron Peter Piot, Belgian microbiologist who co-discovered the EBOLA virus during a lecture delivered on ‘100 years after the Spanish Flu: are we ready for the next epidemic’ held at the University of Hyderabad recently.


According to a press release issued by the UoH, it was the fifth lecture of the Hyderabad Lecture Series, 2019 organized with an aim to bring very eminent personalities to lecture on topics of wide interest and contemporary issues. According to Prof Piot, zoonosis (infections transmitted to humans from animals), urbanisation, high density population, international travel, climate change, conflict (humanitarian crisis), deforestation, population growth & increased food demand contribute to the risk of exposure to more & more emerging infections in future.

“Early detection of epidemic is crucial in containing the epidemic, for which local capacity and rapid support system to respond to disease outbreaks is to be developed. Measures like infection control in Hospitals, action against overuse of antibiotics and vaccine skepticism should be ensured. Research & development of vaccines should be supported,” said Prof Piot.

He further stressed on the need to have active involvement of governments across globe, non-governmental organizations and international organizations like CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation) in epidemic preparedness measures.

Jasprit Bumrah more mature, Hardik Pandya also stepping up: Rohit Sharma 

","
BENGALURU: Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma feels pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah and flamboyant all-rounder Hardik Pandya keep raising the bar for excellence with every game they play.


Mumbai edged past Royal Challengers Bangalore by six runs in their IPL clash on Thursday night and Sharma was lavish in his praise for Bumrah, who picked up three wickets, and Pandya, who scored 32 off 14 deliveries.

""I think Bumrah is more than mature now. Yes, his performance keeps growing everyday. He is a very dedicated individual and takes his game very seriously. He is quite regular with his work ethics,"" he told reporters in the post-match press conference here.


POINTS TABLE | 
SCHEDULE

Bumrah's three wickets came off 20 runs which proved cucial in restricting RCB six short of the 187 runs put up by Mumbai Indians.

Sharma said Bumrah gave a crucial breakthrough by sending back RCB captain Virat Kohli, who was going great guns along with AB De Villiers at one point of the match.

""Bumrah is very smart. We know the class of Virat and AB (De Villiers) and hence we wanted to break the partnership when they were going strong. It (De Villiers) was a crucial wicket at that point of time of the game,"" he said.

On Hardik Pandya's unbeaten knock towards the end of Mumbai innings, Sharma said those runs made the difference and such an innings was needed from him as he didn't do well in the last game against Delhi Capitals.

""...obviously there was a hunger out there to go and do well. He came out and got those crucial runs in the end. He also bowled well in the middle even though he went for few runs. It was a much improved performance from last game. He is also stepping up that ladder,"" he said.

Sharma also said Pandya's form is very important for the team.

""He (Pandya) was out for a bit and didn't play a lot of games. So, he needs time to get into the groove. He is a crucial member of the team and very flexible. His form is very important to us, which will do good for us,"" he said.

Asked about Sri Lankan pacer Lasith Malinga, Sharma said his role is to cramp batsmen by bowling bouncers and yorkers, besides taking wickets in the middle.

""He (Malinga) is the captain of Sri Lankan national team. So, obviously he wants to play the World Cup and wants to do well. He is also coming from South Africa carrying a great form. He wants to keep that form going into the world cup.

""I am sure whenever he plays here for us, he wants to do well. He knows, we expect him to come up here and deliver the goods and take wickets, bowl fast, bowl bouncers and yorkers,"" he added.

US slaps sanctions against Indian man, parents for running global drug smuggling network - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: The US has slapped sanctions against a UAE-based Indian man and his parents for allegedly running a global money laundering and smuggling network for heroin.


The US Department of Treasury on Wednesday said Jasmeet Hakimzada, who lives in the UAE, runs a global drug trafficking network that smuggles heroin, cocaine, ephedrine, ketamine, and synthetic opioids into the US, Australia, New Zealand and the UK.

Since 2008, Hakimzada has laundered hundreds of millions of dollars of illicit proceeds using his UAE-based company Maiwand General Trading Company LLC through financial institutions in the US, Brazil, India, Panama, the UAE and the UK, it alleged.

The Department of Treasury also designated his parents and four entities registered in India or the UAE that form part of the narcotics trafficking organisation run by Hakimzada.

“Jasmeet Hakimzada's global drug trafficking and money laundering network has been involved in smuggling heroin and synthetic opioids around the world,” said Sigal Mandelker, Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.

The Treasury said it designated Harmohan Hakimzada, Hakimzada's father, for him being primary partner in the drug trafficking and money laundering operation; and Eljeet Kaur, his mother, who serves as an officer in two front companies in India.

The four entities designated today include three entities based in India — Maiwand Exim Private Limited, Maiwand Tobacco Limited, and Maiwand Beverages Limited — and UAE-based Maiwand General Trading Company LLC, which operates as a front for an array of illicit activities to include shipping narcotics and illegal pharmaceuticals as well as laundering large sums of narcotics proceeds.

On April 5, 2017, a federal grand jury in the US District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee indicted Hakimzada on 46 counts of drug trafficking and money laundering, the Treasury said in a media release.

Over the course of three years from 2014 through 2016, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) conducted an extensive investigation into Hakimzada's global narcotics and money laundering operation uncovering dozens of drug trafficking and money laundering-related transactions transiting the US involving numerous US banks, as well as drug shipments directly to the US using commercial international courier services.

'Serial offender, apologist': India makes veiled reference to Pakistan as UN moves against terror financing 

","
UNITED NATIONS: In a veiled reference to Pakistan, India said countries that are ""apologists for terrorists"" will continue to provide ""alibis"" justifying their actions and inaction, as it called on the Security Council to ensure crucial sanctions measures against the UN proscribed terrorists and entities are strictly enforced.


The Security Council on Thursday unanimously adopted a resolution calling upon Member States to step up efforts to combat and criminalise the financing of terrorists and their activities.

India welcomed the adoption of the resolution, describing it a ""milestone"" in global efforts to set up a normative framework to criminalise terrorist financing.

India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin, participating in the Security Council open debate on 'Preventing and Combating the Financing of Terrorism', said New Delhi specifically welcomes the recognition in the resolution of the essential role of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in setting global standards, especially in the context of preventing and combating money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing.

Akbaruddin, however, asserted that the Council ""can and needs"" to do a better job of overseeing the implementation of its resolutions relating to terrorist financing and of the various sanctions measures under the 1267 Al- Qaida and 1988 sanctions regimes.

India warned that ""non-compliance of crucial sanctions measures in case of the UN proscribed terrorists and entities renders all of us, Member States, at a high risk of facing challenges from these terrorist organisations who are well funded and armed despite international measures.""

""As the saying goes, the proof of the pudding is in its eating, the utility of any council resolution will, therefore, be in its implementation,"" he said.

""Also, the unfortunate reality is that States who are apologists for terrorists will continue to provide alibis to justify their actions and inaction too, as was done by a serial offender earlier today,"" he said, a veiled reference to Pakistan.

Pakistan's Ambassador to the UN Maleeha Lodhi, in her statement during that debate, said that it is important that the FATF and the 1267 sanctions regimes are ""not used as political tools by some to advance their geo-political objectives."" She also made a reference to Jammu and Kashmir in her statement.

Akbaruddin asserted that the international community needs to be determined to ""continue evolving our tool box and go by our rule book, rather than be distracted and stray from our determination. Our tool box consisting of effective implementation of UN sanctions measures could assist in curtailing these activities in some measure.""

Describing terrorism as a scourge that is tearing at the fabric of societies across the globe, Akbaruddin said it is a menace that is not quarantined to any region.

""People now live in fear of terrorist threats in countries across the world. Combating Terrorism is viewed by many States and their people as one of the most fundamental security policy priorities that require global responsiveness,"" he said, calling the adoption of the resolution an answer to ""a felt need.""

""The global community is impatient for action. The UN collectively needs to do more and do it much more effectively. For its part, India will be a willing partner in this endeavour,"" he said at the open debate convened by France under its Presidency of the Security Council for the month of March.

Akbaruddin further highlighted that many Council resolutions, including the various sanctions measures under the 1267 and 1988 sanctions regimes, where asset freeze is a core part of states' obligations call for regular reporting under these measures.

While welcoming the resolution's focus on ensuring full compliance with the measures imposed by the Security Council, Akbaruddin voiced concern that no effective action is taken on instances of reported non-compliance with the sanctions measures.

He pointed out that the report of the 1267 sanctions Monitoring team dated January 15, 2019 notes that Member States have reported to the Monitoring Team, on an ad hoc basis and a comprehensive review of frozen assets has not been undertaken. He expressed hope that there will action on this front by member states.

""We welcome the Council and its various bodies taking note and rectifying instances of non-implementation to enhance awareness and effective implementation of the various council resolutions on Counter Terrorism. We believe that this work could be strengthened with more cooperation between the FATF and the various UN entities…""

""Bodies such as the FATF have listed risks posed by Da'esh, Al- Qaida, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, Falah-i-Insaniyat Foundation, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Haqqani Network, and persons affiliated with the Taliban,"" he added.

By other terms of the resolution, all States shall — in a manner consistent with their obligations under international law — ensure that their laws and regulations make it possible to prosecute and penalise, as serious criminal offences, the provision or collection of funds, resources and services intended to be used for the benefit of terrorist organisations or individual terrorists.

The resolution also calls upon Member States to conduct financial investigations into terrorism-related cases and to more effectively investigate and prosecute cases of terrorist financing, applying criminal sanctions as appropriate.

End of an 'era': Emperor's exit resets Japan calendar - Times of India

","
TOKYO: The abdication of Japan's Emperor Akihito on April 30 will quite literally mark the end of an era, the Heisei era of his rule, and highly secretive talks have been going on for months on what to call the next one.


This is anything but a procedural issue, as the name of the era has a tangible effect on the daily lives of the Japanese as well as a psychological impact on the nation.

Japan is the only country in the world still using Chinese-style imperial calendars. It might be 2019 in much of the world, but in Japan it is Heisei 31, or the 31st year of Akihito's reign.

While the Gregorian calendar is also widely used in Japan, imperial dates feature on government documents, newspapers, and commercial calendars.

""It is easier to imagine what the time was like if you have eras,"" said Kunio Kowaguchi, president of major calendar maker Todan.

""For instance, we remember it was early Heisei that the bubble burst,"" he told AFP, referring to the collapse of Japan's speculation-driven economy.

The upcoming end of the Heisei period was even reportedly a factor in the government's decision to implement death sentences last year against 13 members of the Aum cult behind a 1995 sarin attack.

Government officials apparently wanted to a draw a line under the cult's attacks before the Heisei era ends. All 13 executions were carried out in July.

Japan has had nearly 250 eras since adopting the system in the 7th century.

In the past, emperors would switch era names mid-reign to mark a fresh start after natural disasters or crises.

But more recently, an era has run the entire length of a monarch's rule.

Crown Prince Naruhito ascends the Chrysanthemum Throne on May 1. His era name will be announced at 11:30am on Monday -- a month ahead of the ceremony.

And speculation over what the name might be has been rife.

There have been more than 10,000 entries in a public guessing competition run by a liquor company, hoping to win a vintage bottle of sake from year one of the Heisei era (1989).

A new era is a real challenge for companies like Kowaguchi's, which produces 10 million calendars a year, many featuring both Western and imperial dates.

Printing begins a year before release, so it was too late for his 2019 run to feature the new name.

The new imperial era will be the first since the IT revolution, and the tech sector is girding for the transition.

It has inspired comparisons to the ""Y2K"" bug ahead of the year 2000, when experts worried about a tech apocalypse fearing that computers would not understand the new date.

""What is largely different from the time of the Y2K problem or the switch to the Heisei period is that IT is widely used and information is passed around among internet-capable devices,"" said Kazunori Ishii, spokesman at Microsoft's Japan arm.

""We can't predict exactly what will happen,"" he said, though he noted that major disruption was ""unlikely"".

Software used in Japan that converts between Western and imperial dates will need to be updated with the new era, and code and fonts for the new name will also need to be created.

The 85-year-old emperor's decision to abdicate gave experts a rare head start in choosing the new era's name.

The task falls to the government rather than the palace and, like many matters involving the royal household, is shrouded in secrecy.

There are stringent guidelines requiring the name to have two characters, be easy to read and write, and not use common names.

The new name is also unlikely to start with the first letter of any of the last four eras: Heisei, Showa, Taisho and Meiji.

And because each era name is considered ""sacred"", any name put forward but rejected in the past cannot be proposed again.

One of the few people familiar with the challenge is Junzo Matoba, a former bureaucrat who helped look for new names during the last years of emperor Hirohito's Showa era, in the late 1980s.

""Some people thought it was irreverent to think about the next era"" while the emperor was still alive, he told AFP.

""I had to work secretly.""

He consulted academics on Asian history and literature while trying to maintain a low profile.

""I found myself caught up in such a difficult task -- I was sitting under the Sword of Damocles,"" the 83-year-old told AFP last year.

Japan's government is believed to have a shortlist of names, but has been mum on potential choices.

The government does not even disclose the names of scholars asked to put up candidate names.

A nine-member panel is to make a pick out of the candidates. Parliament leaders' opinions will be heard on it and then cabinet ministers will meet to give the final go-ahead.

""Japanese people love to 'reset' things,"" said Matoba.

""A new era, a new mindset.

No BCCI curators at top three IPL venues 

","
NEW DELHI: The Indian cricket board (BCCI) has decided to withdraw curators from its panel who fly in to oversee pitch preparations for IPL games at respective venues. The move will affect three venues which do not already have locally-based BCCI-appointed curators, namely Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai.



IPL Schedule

The other five venues have local curators who are also on the BCCI's grounds and pitches committee, so the question of interference and disagreements between curators will not arise.

The move comes after some franchises allegedly objected to the interference from BCCI's curators when it came to local pitch preparation for IPL games. For instance, there was unease in the BCCI after the low-scoring opening match between Chennai Super Kings and Royal Challengers Bangalore in Chennai last Sunday. It has been learnt that local curators were loath to cede control to BCCI-appointed ones at the venue. Venue management for IPL games are undertaken by the local IPL franchise.

The Chepauk pitch was criticised after the pitch took prodigious turn from the first ball of the match, which saw RCB, batting first, being bowled out for 70. In the IPL, curators are usually expected to produce pitches conducive to high-scoring games, but the Chennai match was an exception.

""Curators are always told that the paying public comes to an IPL expecting runs to be scored. Dull pitches can turn away crowds. After the first game, all the venues were reminded of that philosophy and cautioned against having very low-scoring games. Such games also don't go down well with broadcaster as it cuts down live air-time,"" an official said.

The International Management Group (IMG), in charge of the carrying out IPL operations, has also laid out guidelines for preparing pitches. The guideline says that the local curator is in charge of the venue. The guidelines also mention that a pitch can't be used for practice for four days leading up to a match. TOI understands that franchises tend to flout these guidelines and hence the BCCI decided to have its own panel members at the venues before games.

Around five seasons ago, the BCCI started the system of assigning curators to venues which did not have a ground and pitches committee member already stationed. For the Chennai game, the board had sent ground and pitches committee member Tapash Chatterjee to supervise proceedings. Following alleged disagreement with franchises, the board has now decided - within the first week of this year's edition of IPL - to relent and change its policy. ""BCCI curators received instructions from the board on Thursday afternoon to leave their bases. There has been no reason given for the move,"" a top BCCI official told TOI.

TOI understands that some IPL franchises have been pushing for distinct home advantage. ""There has been some unrest over this neutral curator system. BCCI officials are in a fix. There is no clear consensus on this,"" said an official. Delhi, Chennai and Kolkata are the three venues which don't have curators in the BCCI's grounds and pitches committee. Incidentally, this year curators from Mumbai and Hyderabad have been sent to Australia for a seminar, leading to these two venues being also supervised by the BCCI committee.

RCB vs MI no ball controversy: ​​Twitter erupts as umpiring error mars RCB-MI thriller 

","
NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians clinched a 6-run win in a nail-biting final-over thriller against Royal Challenger Bangalore at the M.Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Thursday. But victory for the Rohit Sharma-led side was overshadowed by an umpiring howler. With RCB needing 7 runs off the final ball, the umpire missed the overstepping from Lasith Malinga and MI secured the win.


Soon after the match a fuming Virat Kohli went all-out against the umpiring error. 

""We are playing at IPL level, not club cricket ... that's just a ridiculous call off the last ball. the umpires should have their eyes open, it was a no-ball by an inch. it's a completely different game altogether. so if it's a game of margins, I don't know what's happening. They should have been more sharp and more careful out there,"" said Kohli after the match. 

Social media too went berserk after replays clearly showed that the front foot of Malinga on the final ball was way over the line.

Chasing a daunting target of 188, RCB needed 17 off the last over. Shivam Dubey (9 off 5 balls) and AB De Villiers (70 off 41 balls) were in the middle for the home team and brought the equation down to 7 required of the last ball. 

Had umpire declared the final ball from Malinga an illegal delivery, RCB then, would have got an extra run and a free-hit as well.

But the howler from the umpire helped Mumbai Indians register their first win and handed RCB their second defeat of the season.

‘Air train’ plan to connect IGI terminals set to take off - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Transiting between the various terminals of IGI Airport, the world’s 12th busiest hub, will become a breeze in a few years’ time, with the airport operator finalising the route of an “air train” connecting the terminals as well as Aerocity, the hotel centre.


The train will have four stations, including one at the cargo terminal, which are also expected to provide seamless connectivity with Metro lines. Delhi International Airport Pvt Ltd is currently working on financing the “automated people mover” (APM) project, expected to cost Rs 2,000-2,500 crore.

DIAL did not give a date for the project’s completion but it is likely to be ready in three to four years. This fits in with the timeline given for other ongoing and future phase-wise expansion projects of IGIA.

DIAL had first announced the air train project in 2016 and had said it would be in place by 2020.

The project was deferred due to the hugely delayed expansion of IGIA. The current annual passenger handling capacity of T1, T2 and T3 is 2 crore, 1.2 crore and 3.4 crore, respectively. With T1’s capacity of 2 crore on one end and T2 and T3’s combined capacity of 3.6 crore on the other, lakhs of transit travellers even at present rush between these terminal on busy roads.

DIAL says the expansion of T1 and T3, along with the fourth runway and elevated taxi track, will be complete by mid-2022. Once this happens, there will be greater transit passenger flow between T1 and T3/2. “T2 is expected to be demolished in 2024 and in its place terminal T4 would be built in two phases by 2028,” the airport operator said.

The 5.1km-long air train will be underground between T1 and Aerocity. From there to T3, the train will be mostly elevated. It will have four stations — T1, Aerocity, cargo terminal and a common terminal for T1 and T2/4.

“With the fast growing passenger traffic across three passenger terminal buildings, there is a need to have a seamless commuting mechanism for inter-terminal passenger movement. This is also in line with (guidance from) the (aviation) ministry and other government agencies as well. Hence, DIAL has approached the world’s leading APM providers to explore the same. The route alignment has been finalised and various technologies from Europe and Asia are being explored by involving different agencies to assess the feasibility of the project,” a DIAL spokesman said.

Asked why the project, which was supposed to be ready in 2020, got so much delayed, the spokesman said: “DIAL has been proactively working to bring the safest and most passenger friendly APM solution. Since we have involved global leading companies from Europe and Japan, evaluating different technologies is taking some time. Further, the capital investment is significant. Hence, we are exploring various models for developing the APM, including low cost financing.”

“We are also discussing with the government various possibilities of financing the APM. We will soon come out with a concrete plan for its implementation,” the spokesman added.

The air train is becoming a must for IGIA due to its sheer passenger volume and transit traffic. Despite severe infrastructure constraints at the moment, in terms of the capacity of terminals and runways, IGIA was the world’s 12th busiest airport last year when it handled just under 7 crore flyers.

FAA's safety check under lens as Boeing unveils software fix - Times of India

","
RENTON (WASHINGTON): Boeing on Wednesday made its most overt acknowledgment to date that new software in its jets could have played a role in two deadly crashes as it tries to convince pilots, airlines and regulators around the world that a coming fix will solve the problem.


Before a meeting with more than 200 pilots and airline executives at its factory in Renton, Washington, Boeing, for the first time, publicly laid out its proposed updates to the software as well other changes to the 737 Max that it hopes will get the plane flying again.

The changes would give pilots more control over the system and make it less likely to be set off by faulty data, two issues at the center of the investigations into the crashes. ""The rigor and thoroughness of the design and testing that went into the Max gives us complete confidence that the changes we're making will address any of these accidents,"" Mike Sinnett, Boeing's vice-president for product strategy, said.

The firm, which was eager to complete the plane quickly for competitive reasons, also faced new scrutiny in Washington on Wednesday over the development and certification of the jet, a process that regulators heavily delegated to Boeing. Senators, in two congressional hearings with Boeing's regulators, pressed for more oversight and raised the possibility of overhauling the system.

The acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration, in a hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee's aviation subcommittee, said that the agency initially scrutinized the new software independently, but ultimately left it to Boeing. The official, Daniel Elwell, also said he did not believe the automated system had been tested with a scenario involving a faulty sensor, which was a concern in a Lion Air crash in Indonesia in October.

The FAA has long allowed plane-makers to help certify that their new aircraft meet safety standards. In recent years, Boeing was able to choose its own employees to help regulators approve the 737 Max. Elwell defended the agency's practice, saying the strategy has ""consistently produced safe aircraft designs for decades"". And he said the agency would need 10,000 more employees and an additional $1.8 billion a year to do all the work now done by designated employees of the firms it regulates

""The FAA decided to do safety on the cheap, which is neither cheap nor safe,"" said Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal. ""The FAA put the fox in charge of the henhouse.""

A Boeing official cautioned against drawing any definite conclusions until more is known. ""In general, the process has worked and continues to work, and we see no reason to overhaul the process,"" this official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the investigations.

The Boeing official said that in most crashes, many things go wrong. Based on what is known about the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, Boeing said it felt that MCAS was in need of updating. ""We-'ve seen two accidents now and we believe it is appropriate to make that link in the chain more robust,"" the official said.

The updated software, which Boeing outlined on Wednesday, will rely on data from two so-called angle of attack sensors, so the plane will not have a single point of failure. It will also make it easier for pilots to override the system, which was originally designed to push down the nose of the plane repeatedly and aggressively. Although the fix is apparently ready, Boeing provided no timetable for installing it.

Virat Kohli second batsman to score 5000 runs in IPL 

","
NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bangalore skipper Virat Kohli became the second batsman to complete 5000 runs in the history of the Indian Premier League. Kohli got to the milestone in the seventh match of the IPL 2019 against Mumbai Indians at M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru.



IPL Schedule | 
IPL Points Table

Suresh Raina is the other batsman to have achieved the landmark. The season opener against Bangalore saw Raina reach the landmark in his 177th IPL match.

Kohli joined the elite list in his 165th IPL match when he reached 46 off 31 balls. The 30-year-old batsman failed to continue as he got dismissed off the very next ball. Mumbai Indians skipper Rohit Sharma is third on the list of highest run scorers in IPL with 4555 runs in 175 matches. 

Kohli has scored as many as four IPL centuries and 34 fifties in the IPL. Interestingly, all his hundreds so far were scored in the 2016 edition. It was actually a tournament that saw him create a plethora of records in the IPL.

He is the only player in fact to have scored four centuries in one season. The 30-year-old also amassed 973 runs in 16 matches in that edition, at a mind boggling average of 81.08 that earned him his only Orange Cap in his IPL career so far.

Virat was the first player to breach the 4000-run mark in IPL. His tally of 973 runs still remains the most runs scored by a player in a single IPL season.

On the match front, an umpiring howler off the last delivery cost Royal Challengers Bangalore dearly as Mumbai Indians pipped the hosts by six runs largely due to Jasprit Bumrah's brilliant spell at the death.

India's first feeder school offers skill-based curriculum - Times of India

","
Enrolment starts after class VIII and the curriculum will consist of three skill-based subjects along with Computer Science and a language
CBSE recently gave its approval for a feeder school in Palwal district of Haryana, which offers skill-based education right from class IX. One of the aims of this school is also to control the increasing dropout rate at the secondary level. As per the school authorities, most students studying in state government schools dropout because of financial constraints or due to their inability to cope with higher education syllabus.





 ""Many students after their primary schooling are forced to take up jobs mainly because of financial limitations of the family. So, we want them to learn skills that will be relevant in the job market soon after they finish their basic schooling,"" says Raj Nehru, vice chancellor, Shri Vishwakarma Skill University (SVSU), Haryana, which will host the feeder school.

The feeder school will be operational from the coming academic session of 2019-20. ""We come across many students who fail to cope up with the pressure of high school syllabus, and refuse to continue further,"" says Nehru. This year, the school will enrol students from class IX onwards and the curriculum will consist of three skill-based subjects along with Computer Science and a language subject. ""We have identified 15 core skill areas, including automotive, aviation, healthcare, food, manufacturing, agriculture, IT, etc., of which students can pick any three,"" says Nehru.

The aim is to avoid unnecessary burden of subjects that may not help the students get a job after finishing class XII. ""Regular visits to industries, project works and practical training will be a part of the curriculum. Some relevant portions of STEM subjects will also be taught,"" he adds.

In class XI and XII, students would have the option of specialising in one of the skill-based subjects. ""After class XII, the students will have the option of completing Bachelor of Vocation (BVoc), recognised by the UGC or go into the traditional education system, as the student will pass out with a school certificate equivalent to CBSE's class XII.

Mumbai youth lands Rs 1.2 crore job at Google's London office 

","
MUMBAI: Abdullah Khan (21) may have failed to crack the entrance for IITs, but he has bagged an offer that many IITians would envy. Early this week, Khan landed a job at Google's London office, for a package of Rs 1.2 crore. The average salary offered to a graduate from a non-IIT engineering college in the city is around Rs 4 lakh pa.


Khan, a student of Shree LR Tiwari Engineering College, Mira Road, was called for an interview by Google on the basis of a profile on a site that hosts competitive programming challenges.

After a few online interviews, Khan was asked to appear for the final screening at Google's office in London early this month.

His six-figure package includes the base salary of Rs 54.5 lakh (£60,000) per annum, 15 per cent bonus and stock options worth Rs 58.9 lakh ($85,000) over four years. Khan, who is doing his final year BE (computer science), will join Google's site reliability engineering team in September.

An email from a Google official in November last year mentioned that they had seen Khan's profile on the programming site, and said they were looking for people for locations across Europe.

Khan told TOI he was not expecting such an offer when he participated in competitions on that site. ""I used to participate as it was fun. I did not even know that firms check programmers' profiles on such sites. I showed the email to my friend who knew someone who had received such an email in the past. I am looking forward to joining their team. It will be an amazing learning experience for me,"" said Khan. The coding junkie did his schooling in Saudi Arabia and moved to Mumbai only after Class XII.

Mamata Banerjee: Priyanka Gandhi’s 2022 quip triggers talk on Congress strategy 

","
AMETHI/RAE BARELI: During a late-night meeting in Amethi on Wednesday, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra urged party workers to keep up the poll momentum till 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. ""Tayyari kar rahe ho aap chunaav ki? Iss wale ki nahi, 2022 ke liye…"" (Are you working for the party's victory in the 2022 elections?),"" she said.


Priyanka's remarks followed demands to field the son of late Congress MLA Noor Mohammad from the Gauriganj assembly seat. ""Please keep the honour of my brother. We always defended you Didi. Please keep your promise,"" pleaded a relative of Noor.

Her comment triggered speculation about whether Congress was strategically going for a direct fight with regional powers SP and BSP in 2019 to dig its heels in for the longer battle for 2022 or keep a limited focus on under-30 seats this time.

Priyanka held back-to-back meetings with boothlevel workers in Rae Bareli. At a public meeting, she said she deliberately stayed away from Amethi and Rae Bareli in the last five years as she sought full responsibility. ""I stayed away from Amethi and Rae Bareli because I don't like half measures. I thought I will be fully active when I get total responsibility,"" Priyanka told workers.

Political rivals, however, launched a poster campaign against Priyanka for showing up in Rae Bareli only on the eve of elections.

Sharad Pawar: NCP deals Congress big blow in Gujarat, to fight all 26 seats 

","
AHMEDABAD: Sharad Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party on Thursday dealt a blow to Congress by announcing that it would contest all 26 Lok Sabha seats in Gujarat. Both Congress and NCP have adopted a combative stance, though both also say there is still scope for an alliance as the last day for filing nominations is April 4.


""NCP will go ahead and announce its candidates for all 26 seats in the next two or three days,"" NCP state chief Jayant Patel said, indicating a faltering of talks. With just a week to go before the last day for filing nominations and the tie-up not working out, it appears NCP will play spoilsport yet again for Congress.

NCP's fielding of candidates on all seats along with five assembly seats where bypolls are to be held will translate into a straight division in the anti-BJP votes.

NCP had sought Porbandar, Panchmahal and Gandhinagar seats as part of the seat-sharing formula.

Although Congress and NCP have been natural allies at the national level for long, the two have not been able to stitch a sustainable alliance in Gujarat. They had a prepoll alliance in the 2004 and 2014 general elections in Gujarat. Congress left the Rajkot LS seat for NCP in 2004 and the Porbandar LS seat in 2014. NCP lost on both occasions. The two parties did not have any pre-poll alliance in Gujarat in the 1999 and 2009 general elections. NCP fielded candidates on seven seats in 1999, all of whom lost, and again on seven seats in 2009. No NCP candidate won in 2009 either.

In the 2017 assembly elections, after alliance talks between Congress and NCP collapsed at the last minute, NCP fielded 58 candidates, and registered a win on the Kutiyana seat. However, NCP cost Congress five assembly seats - Prantij, Dholka, Umreth, Fatehpara and Dangs. If an alliance would have happened between Congress and NCP, BJP would have been reduced to 94 seats in the assembly.

Madras high court: Declare all corrupt babus, judicial officers anti-nationals 

","
CHENNAI: In a rare admission, the Madras high court has said even the judiciary is not exempt from the clutches of corruption and that corrupt judicial officers and public servants should be declared anti-nationals. 


Justice SM Subramaniam, in scathing remarks on Thursday, observed that corruption in the judiciary was the greatest enemy of the Constitution and that the judiciary must also initiate drastic measures to control corruption in various forms. Noting that bribing public authorities starts right from the child in the mother's womb, the judge said officials had to be bribed even for getting the benefits of government welfare schemes.

""They are anti-nationals because they are obstructing the development of this great nation. Terrorists are declared as anti-social elements. Thus, persons corrupt and acting against the developmental activities of our nation are also to be declared as anti-nationals. These anti-nationals do not care about the development of this country but are only interested in their self-development,"" Justice Subramaniam said.

""It is painful and unfortunate to state that sexual favours are demanded in lieu of bribe in educational institutions and public offices and what else can be worse than this in public administration,"" Justice Subramaniam said.

The worst form of corruption was happening at burial grounds and we people tolerate even that. Unless public servants at burial grounds maintained by the state or local bodies are bribed, the dead body will not get an appropriate timing for burial. The right to decent burial is also denied, the judge added.

Coming down heavily on poll-related corruption, the judge said, ""these representatives of the people are not only accountable but also responsible for enactment of laws. If they indulge in such corrupt activities like bribing voters, the very foundation of democratic principles is shaken.""

The court made the observations while dismissing a plea moved by P Saravanan, a village administrative officer (VAO), who was suspended from service on allegations of corruption. Saravanan wanted the court to quash his suspension and direct the authorities to reinstate him in service.

Ocean heat hits record high: UN - Times of India

","
GENEVA: Ocean heat hit a record high in 2018, the United Nations said Thursday, raising urgent new concerns about the threat global warming is posing to marine life.


In its latest State of the Climate overview, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reaffirmed that the last four years had been the hottest on record — figures previously announced in provisional drafts of the flagship report.

But the final version of the report highlighted worrying developments in other climate indicators beyond surface temperature.

""2018 saw new records for ocean heat content in the upper 700 metres,"" a WMO statement said.

The agency said the UN had data for heat content in the upper 700 metres (2,290 feet) of the ocean dating back to 1955.

Last year also saw new heat records for the ocean's upper 2,000 metres, but data for that range only goes back to 2005.

The previous records for both ranges were set in 2017.

About 93 per cent of excess heat — trapped around the Earth by greenhouse gases that come from the burning of fossil fuels — accumulates in the world's oceans.

Research published earlier this year in the US journal Science showed that warming in the oceans is on pace with measurements of rising air temperature.

Some models predict the temperature of the top 2,000 metres of world's oceans will rise nearly 0.8 degrees Celsius by the end of the century if nothing is done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, according to Science.

Oceans are also not warming evenly across the planet.

The WMO report said the highest rates of ocean warming are occurring in the southern ocean, where warming has also reached the deepest layers.

This could result in sea levels being substantially different in different places, experts have previously said.

The thermal expansion — water swelling as it warms — is expected to raise sea levels 12 inches (30 centimetres), above any sea level rise from melting glaciers and ice sheets, according to the research published in Science.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who launched the WMO report in New York, said its findings confirmed ""the urgency of climate action"".

""There is no longer any time for delay,"" he warned, stressing that nations needed to come to his Climate Action Summit in September with ""concrete, realistic plans"" to reduce emissions. (AFP)

Trump, Moon to meet in Washington in April: Seoul - Times of India

","
SEOUL: US President Donald Trump will host his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in next month, Seoul said Friday, after the latest summit between Washington and Pyongyang ended in deadlock.

Moon has long backed a policy of engagement with nuclear-armed, sanctions-hit Pyongyang and was instrumental in brokering talks between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. But the failure of Kim and Trump to reach an agreement in Hanoi on curtailing Pyongyang's nuclear programme in exchange for relaxation of sanctions has raised questions over the future of the process.

Moon will visit Washington for two days from April 10, an official from the South's presidential Blue House told AFP.

""The two leaders will have in-depth talks... to coordinate their stance on setting up a peace regime on the Korean peninsula through complete denuclearisation,"" Yoon Do-han, the senior presidential press secretary said Friday.

Earlier this month, Pyongyang abruptly pulled its staff out of an inter-Korean liaison office, but the officials came back to the joint facility in the Northern city of Kaesong days later.

Their return came after Trump announced he had ""ordered"" the withdrawal of additional sanctions — without identifying the measures — against Pyongyang by the US Treasury.

Gmail App Swipes Feature: iPhone users, Gmail app has finally got this much-needed feature - Times of India

","
Google has already given Android users the privilege of customising the swiping gesture in the Gmail app to quickly delete, archive or mark emails as read/unread. However, iPhone (iOS) users still lacked the functionality until now. The search giant has finally announced that it is bringing the same email swiping features to Gmail’s iOS app as well. The idea behind this is to cut the extra time and thumb exercise that iPhone users had to do to delete, mark as read, archive, snooze and carry out other options for each mail.

“You can now set up swipe actions in Gmail on iOS to do any of the following actions: Archive, Trash, Mark as read/unread, Snooze, and Move to,” said the G suite blog post. The feature can be accessed by navigating through the Gmail iOS app’s Settings > Swipe actions, and choosing the function for left and right swipes. 

It is worth adding that swiping for each email is present in Gmail’s iOS app but swiping either left or right will show you the same function. With new customisation options you can change what shows when you swipe each mail towards left or right. 

Not just this but Gmail now also supports 3D Touch gesture for snoozing an email right from the notifications panel. “In addition to using swipe actions to quickly triage your email, you can also use the same actions to triage your notifications as well. For example, if you like to snooze emails, you can press firmly (3D Touch) or long press on a Gmail iOS notification, and click on ""Snooze"" directly to pick the date and time when to snooze the email until,” states the blog post.

It has been confirmed that swipe customisation features are already in the process of rolling out and is also available for all the G Suite editions. This new feature comes days after Google announced a major UI overhaul for the Gmail app.

SRH vs RR Preview: Sunrisers Hyderabad out to tame Rajasthan Royals 

","
HYDERABAD: Out 'muscled' by a Jamaican who goes by the name of Andre Russell, Sunrisers Hyderabad will look to make amends against a side which is reeling under the 'Mankad' effect. Like the Sunrisers, Rajasthan Royals too were cruising towards victory when a 'game-changer' act by Kings XI Punjab skipper R Ashwin turned the match on its head. The off-spinner 'ran out' Jos Buttler and the Royals caved in meekly thereafter. Smarting under the 'unlikely' losses, both teams are keen to regroup quickly and get their campaign off the ground as they lock horns at the RGIC Stadium, here on Friday night.



IPL Schedule | 
IPL Points Table

The hosts have much to cheer about as their top three batsmen were among the runs in Kolkata. As a duck takes to the water, opener David Warner seamlessly blended himself with the team. The one-year 'forced' break seems to have had no effect on the pocket dynamite. In fact, Warner looked hungry and keen on showing what the fans had missed last season. On way to a 53-ball 85, the Australian had become the first batsman in IPL to post 40 fifty plus innings (3 hundreds and 37 fifties) but to his chagrin Russell stole the thunder. 



With Jonny Bairstow and Vijay Shankar getting runs under the belt and Yusuf Pathan and Manish Pandey in the ranks, the Sunrisers look a much improved batting side. However, the Sunrisers will have to contend against Jofra Archer. The Barbardian born bowler, who is eligible to play for England and is likely to be in their World Cup squad, not only generates genuine pace but is also a very crafty one. Against the explosive Kings XI, Archer conceded just 17 runs in his four overs. The others to watch out for will be Dhawal Kulkarni and K Gowtham.

The hosts' concern will be the bowling which was taken part by Russell on Sunday. Barring leggie Rashid Khan, none of the others could make much of an impact and that is something the hosts will have to address. The Sunrisers, over the years, have taken pride in their bowling attack. They have mastered the art of defending small totals and hence being torn to shreds in the opening game is some food for thought for the team management.



The Sunrisers' bowlers will undergo another acid test as the Royals too boost of an aggressive batting line-up. Buttler, on Monday, showed what kind of damage he is capable of inflicting on the opposition. 



Skipper Ajinkya Rahane is a 'man on a mission' as he is keen on proving his critics wrong. Sanju Samson, Steve Smith and the big-hitting Ben Stokes give the Royals a formidable look. The dangerman will be Smith as the Australian has the uncanny ability to rotate the strike and also go for the big hits when needed. But the way they lost six wickets for just 20 runs at the death against Kings XI is something which they need to look into on an urgent basis as the Sunrisers' bowlers will be eagerly waiting to exploit the chinks in the Royals armour.

US slaps sanctions against Indian man, parents for running global drug smuggling network - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: The US has slapped sanctions against a UAE-based Indian man and his parents for allegedly running a global money laundering and smuggling network for heroin.


The US Department of Treasury on Wednesday said Jasmeet Hakimzada, who lives in the UAE, runs a global drug trafficking network that smuggles heroin, cocaine, ephedrine, ketamine, and synthetic opioids into the US, Australia, New Zealand and the UK.

Since 2008, Hakimzada has laundered hundreds of millions of dollars of illicit proceeds using his UAE-based company Maiwand General Trading Company LLC through financial institutions in the US, Brazil, India, Panama, the UAE and the UK, it alleged.

The Department of Treasury also designated his parents and four entities registered in India or the UAE that form part of the narcotics trafficking organisation run by Hakimzada.

“Jasmeet Hakimzada's global drug trafficking and money laundering network has been involved in smuggling heroin and synthetic opioids around the world,” said Sigal Mandelker, Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.

The Treasury said it designated Harmohan Hakimzada, Hakimzada's father, for him being primary partner in the drug trafficking and money laundering operation; and Eljeet Kaur, his mother, who serves as an officer in two front companies in India.

The four entities designated today include three entities based in India — Maiwand Exim Private Limited, Maiwand Tobacco Limited, and Maiwand Beverages Limited — and UAE-based Maiwand General Trading Company LLC, which operates as a front for an array of illicit activities to include shipping narcotics and illegal pharmaceuticals as well as laundering large sums of narcotics proceeds.

On April 5, 2017, a federal grand jury in the US District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee indicted Hakimzada on 46 counts of drug trafficking and money laundering, the Treasury said in a media release.

Over the course of three years from 2014 through 2016, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) conducted an extensive investigation into Hakimzada's global narcotics and money laundering operation uncovering dozens of drug trafficking and money laundering-related transactions transiting the US involving numerous US banks, as well as drug shipments directly to the US using commercial international courier services.

Amrapali group diverted Rs 3,000 crore of homebuyers' money: Auditors to Supreme Court - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Seven months after the Supreme Court ordered a forensic audit of 

  Amrapali group
 + to track misuse of homebuyers' money, the final report said illegal diversion of over Rs 3,000 crore led to the financial collapse of the group, leaving thousands of investors stranded.


The auditors, Ravi Bhatia and Pawan Aggarwal, filed a voluminous report running into more than 2,000 pages in the SC. They said the group set up more than 100 shell companies in the names of its officials, including one in which a peon was inducted in a senior position, to divert money which was used for personal gain of directors, officials and their relatives.



SC sends Amrapali CMD, 2 directors to police custody for cheating homebuyers


The report made it evident that the collapse of the Amrapali group was not due to a change in market conditions or investment decisions gone bad but because of the wilful criminal actions of the group's proprietors. The court had directed a forensic audit in September last year.

Justice Arun Mishra, who along with Justice UU Lalit is hearing the plea of thousands of homebuyers, informed their lawyer ML Lahoti on Thursday that the auditors had filed their report and the court would examine it on April 9.

Around 46,000 people had invested in Amrapali's housing projects but were not given flats. The buyers sought the SC's protection after the lender bank initiated insolvency proceedings against the company. The court then decided to supervise construction and assured buyers that their interest will be protected and sought a forensic audit of 46 registered companies to track funds and beneficiaries.

The court's apprehension that the group siphoned off homebuyer money proved correct with the forensic report finding ""documentary evidence"" to show that funds were transferred to more than 100 shell companies outside Amrapali group through dubious transactions. The money was invested in mutual funds, LIC policies and for expansion of business other than construction activity.

The auditors also gave a list of dubious and benami homebuyers in whose names flats worth lakhs of rupees were booked on payment of paltry sums.

The auditors said Amrapali's directors, the chief financial officer and statutory auditors were part of the plan to divert homebuyer money.

Jasprit Bumrah more mature, Hardik Pandya also stepping up: Rohit Sharma 

","
BENGALURU: Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma feels pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah and flamboyant all-rounder Hardik Pandya keep raising the bar for excellence with every game they play.


Mumbai edged past Royal Challengers Bangalore by six runs in their IPL clash on Thursday night and Sharma was lavish in his praise for Bumrah, who picked up three wickets, and Pandya, who scored 32 off 14 deliveries.

""I think Bumrah is more than mature now. Yes, his performance keeps growing everyday. He is a very dedicated individual and takes his game very seriously. He is quite regular with his work ethics,"" he told reporters in the post-match press conference here.


POINTS TABLE | 
SCHEDULE

Bumrah's three wickets came off 20 runs which proved cucial in restricting RCB six short of the 187 runs put up by Mumbai Indians.

Sharma said Bumrah gave a crucial breakthrough by sending back RCB captain Virat Kohli, who was going great guns along with AB De Villiers at one point of the match.

""Bumrah is very smart. We know the class of Virat and AB (De Villiers) and hence we wanted to break the partnership when they were going strong. It (De Villiers) was a crucial wicket at that point of time of the game,"" he said.

On Hardik Pandya's unbeaten knock towards the end of Mumbai innings, Sharma said those runs made the difference and such an innings was needed from him as he didn't do well in the last game against Delhi Capitals.

""...obviously there was a hunger out there to go and do well. He came out and got those crucial runs in the end. He also bowled well in the middle even though he went for few runs. It was a much improved performance from last game. He is also stepping up that ladder,"" he said.

Sharma also said Pandya's form is very important for the team.

""He (Pandya) was out for a bit and didn't play a lot of games. So, he needs time to get into the groove. He is a crucial member of the team and very flexible. His form is very important to us, which will do good for us,"" he said.

Asked about Sri Lankan pacer Lasith Malinga, Sharma said his role is to cramp batsmen by bowling bouncers and yorkers, besides taking wickets in the middle.

""He (Malinga) is the captain of Sri Lankan national team. So, obviously he wants to play the World Cup and wants to do well. He is also coming from South Africa carrying a great form. He wants to keep that form going into the world cup.

""I am sure whenever he plays here for us, he wants to do well. He knows, we expect him to come up here and deliver the goods and take wickets, bowl fast, bowl bouncers and yorkers,"" he added.

No BCCI curators at top three IPL venues 

","
NEW DELHI: The Indian cricket board (BCCI) has decided to withdraw curators from its panel who fly in to oversee pitch preparations for IPL games at respective venues. The move will affect three venues which do not already have locally-based BCCI-appointed curators, namely Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai.



IPL Schedule

The other five venues have local curators who are also on the BCCI's grounds and pitches committee, so the question of interference and disagreements between curators will not arise.

The move comes after some franchises allegedly objected to the interference from BCCI's curators when it came to local pitch preparation for IPL games. For instance, there was unease in the BCCI after the low-scoring opening match between Chennai Super Kings and Royal Challengers Bangalore in Chennai last Sunday. It has been learnt that local curators were loath to cede control to BCCI-appointed ones at the venue. Venue management for IPL games are undertaken by the local IPL franchise.

The Chepauk pitch was criticised after the pitch took prodigious turn from the first ball of the match, which saw RCB, batting first, being bowled out for 70. In the IPL, curators are usually expected to produce pitches conducive to high-scoring games, but the Chennai match was an exception.

""Curators are always told that the paying public comes to an IPL expecting runs to be scored. Dull pitches can turn away crowds. After the first game, all the venues were reminded of that philosophy and cautioned against having very low-scoring games. Such games also don't go down well with broadcaster as it cuts down live air-time,"" an official said.

The International Management Group (IMG), in charge of the carrying out IPL operations, has also laid out guidelines for preparing pitches. The guideline says that the local curator is in charge of the venue. The guidelines also mention that a pitch can't be used for practice for four days leading up to a match. TOI understands that franchises tend to flout these guidelines and hence the BCCI decided to have its own panel members at the venues before games.

Around five seasons ago, the BCCI started the system of assigning curators to venues which did not have a ground and pitches committee member already stationed. For the Chennai game, the board had sent ground and pitches committee member Tapash Chatterjee to supervise proceedings. Following alleged disagreement with franchises, the board has now decided - within the first week of this year's edition of IPL - to relent and change its policy. ""BCCI curators received instructions from the board on Thursday afternoon to leave their bases. There has been no reason given for the move,"" a top BCCI official told TOI.

TOI understands that some IPL franchises have been pushing for distinct home advantage. ""There has been some unrest over this neutral curator system. BCCI officials are in a fix. There is no clear consensus on this,"" said an official. Delhi, Chennai and Kolkata are the three venues which don't have curators in the BCCI's grounds and pitches committee. Incidentally, this year curators from Mumbai and Hyderabad have been sent to Australia for a seminar, leading to these two venues being also supervised by the BCCI committee.

RCB vs MI: Jasprit Bumrah chokes RCB at death as Mumbai Indians win by 6 runs 

","
BENGALURU: The vociferous crowd at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium was still celebrating home skipper Virat Kohli's personal milestone of 5,000 runs - the second by a player after Suresh Raina - when Jasprit Bumrah (3/20), unleashed a short ball which Kohli (46, 32b, 6x4), who hadn't scored a boundary in 10 balls, tried to pull.
 


 IPL Schedule| IPL Points Table | Scorecard
The delivery took flight but didn't go the distance and was pouched by Hardik Pandya at midwicket. The contest between arguably the finest pacer and batsman was won by the former.



Chasing 188 for victory was always going to be a daunting task and Royal Challengers Bangalore needed 72 off 28 balls when the skipper departed. But Mumbai had AB de Villers (70 no, 41b, 4x4, 6x6) to contend with. Up stepped ABD slamming Lasith Malinga for 20 runs in the 16th over and the 18th over from Hardik Pandya yielded 18 runs, but Bumrah still turned the match on its head.

It's not for nothing that the wily pacer is one of the most feared death-over specialist. In the 17th over he accounted for Shimron Hetmyer and conceded a single run and in the penultimate over he sent back a struggling Colin de Grandhomme while giving away only five runs.

Needing 17 runs off the last over, de Villiers slammed Malinga over the ropes off the first ball, but the Sri Lankan, who joined the team only on Wednesday night, weighed in with his experience and Mumbai won by six runs with the hosts finishing with 181/5.



Earlier, RCB bowlers and MI batsmen oscillated between being good and ordinary. A case in point was the 14th over of Mumbai's innings in which leggie Yuzvendra Chahal (4/38) conceded 20 runs which saw Yuvraj Singh cart him for three consecutive maximums before being dismissed off the fourth delivery. On the other hand, pacer Umesh Yadav, bowling the 17th over, was measly giving away only two runs and claimed a wicket.

Even as the home side seemed like they were in control of the death overs, the big-hitting Hardik flexed his muscles with an unbeaten 14-ball 32 (2x4, 3x6) to take the visiting side to a competitive 187/8. Forty runs came off the last 17 balls.

Put into bat by the home team skipper Virat Kohli, the visitors were off to a good start provided by Rohit Sharma (48, 33b, 8x4, 1x6) with his fellow opener Quinton de Kock (23, 20, 3x4, 1x6) a tad slow off the blocks. On a wicket which offered the bowlers early pace, Rohit was quick to react. He made his intent clear as he struck consecutive boundaries off Umesh Yadav's bowling and added a couple more off Navdeep Saina in the flowing over as Mumbai piled 52 runs in powerplay. De Kock survived on 16 as Colin de Grandhomme put him down at midwicket off Saini's bowling. But the South African didn't make much of the lifeline.

Introduced in the seventh over, Chahal struck immediately, with de Kock losing his stumps as he tried to reverse sweep a googly.

Suryakumar Yadav (38, 24b, 4x4, 1x6) then decided to go after the bowlers in the company of Yuvraj Singh. After Yuvraj, Chahal, who got crucial wickets despite going for runs, sent back Yadav.

The hosts decided to go with an unchanged squad, while Mumbai brought in Lasith Malinga and Mayank Markande in place of Ben Cutting and Rasikh Khan.

Indian-origin policewoman jailed for forging molestation victim's statement - Times of India

","
SINGAPORE: An Indian-origin policewoman in 
Singapore has been jailed for five months for forging the statement of an alleged molestation victim in a serious dereliction of duty, which almost saw the woman being charged for giving false information, a media report said on Tuesday.


Senior staff sergeant Kalaivani Kalimuthu, 38, was an investigation officer in the Violence Against Persons Squad when she committed the offence.

Kalaivani handled a case of a woman who was not named in court documents. The woman lodged a police complaint in March 2016, alleging that she was molested by a person who also tried to rape her.

Kalaivani was assigned to conduct an investigation into the case and had to interview the woman and record a further statement.

She called the woman but could not arrange an interview with her. As she wanted to complete the investigation quickly, Kalaivani forged the further statement, Deputy Public Prosecutor Stephanie Chew told the court,

She did so on her police-issued laptop in November 2016, without the woman present, adding details to the statement that the woman had never provided, Channel News Asia reported.

The details include a claim that the woman touched her alleged molester during the incident, and she did not mind her attacker touching her.

Kalaivani signed the statement with the woman's name by tracing her signature from the previous statement and sent the investigation papers to her officer-in-charge, recommending that no further action be taken regarding the woman's police report.

The police sent the investigation papers to the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC), recommending that a warning be given to the woman for giving false information to the police.

The AGC directed the police to take a further statement from the woman when the police recommended charging her for providing false information.

The matter was reassigned to another investigation officer, who interviewed the woman in person in June 2017. He showed her the forged statement, and the woman denied having given any such statement.

Kalaivani, who has been suspended from the 
Singapore Police Force, pleaded guilty in December.

The prosecution had asked for five to six months' jail term, saying that Kalaivani's offence ""was in severe dereliction of the duties she had been entrusted with"", and in flagrant breach of trust reposed in her, the report said.

""The accused's offence has also harmed the public interest and has the potential to undermine public confidence in law enforcement agencies and the proper administration of criminal justice,"" it said, quoting Deputy Public Prosecutor Stephanie Chew.

While acknowledging that Kalaivani had pleaded guilty early, she pointed out that ""this is a case where the prosecution would not have had any difficulty proving its case at trial"".

For committing forgery, Kalaivani could have been jailed for up to four years, fined, or both.

Jack Dorsey: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told to file reply for caste tweet - Times of India

","
JODHPUR: The Rajasthan high court has directed Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to file his reply by April 12 in a petition filed by a Brahmin organisation accusing him of hurting the community’s sentiments in a tweet last year. He has been allowed to file the reply through his counsel.


A single bench of justice Manoj Kumar Garg has adjourned the matter and extended the interim stay on his arrest till April 24. 

The Jodhpur police had registered a case against Dorsey on the directions of the high court after Rajkumar Sharma from the Vipra Foundation filed a plea in November last year accusing him of using a humiliating tone on the community on Twitter. The tweet was later removed and Twitter rendered an apology on the CEO’s behalf.

Dorsey’s counsel later sought quashing of the FIR after investigating officer informed the HC of absence of information on the deleted tweet, which was posted on November 18, 2018.

'Grand alliance' failed to take off as Rahul Gandhi did not override local satraps: Tarun Gogoi - Times of India

","
GUWAHATI: The opposition's anti-BJP 'grand alliance' failed to take the desired shape as Congress president Rahul Gandhi chose not to ""override"" the sentiments of state leaders who did not favour the move, party veteran and three-time Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi said.


Gogoi, a six-term former MP and union minister, also rubbished the BJP's allegation of the Congress being a ""dynastic"" party, insisting it was the ""most democratic"" in the country.

He said despite the opposition alliance being nebulous because of lack of formal tie-ups, the anti-BJP parties were united in their intent of defeating the saffron party and its allies.

""Rahul Gandhi was keen on alliance most of the time. But the local party leaders said no. Our party gives importance to regional leadership. That is why we have not been able to form alliances in many places,"" Gogoi told PTI in an interview.

""Though the Congress is often dubbed as a dynastic party, it is the most democratic party. Rahul Gandhi does not override the sentiments of local leaders who are heard and given due importance,"" he said.

Gogoi, when asked if a pre-poll pact between potential partners of the proposed grand alliance could have got them more seats, said nobody can predict that with any amount of certainty.

The Assam leader also appeared to favour the largest party in a winning coalition deciding which direction the government would take.

""Even in case of alliance, the largest party can administer and rule the country. That is also needed. The single largest party must have sufficient strength so that it is not dependent on alliance all the time. Otherwise, the alliance (its smaller constituents) will dictate. And that is not good for the country,"" he said.

Referring to the seat sharing agreement between the Congress and CPM for the West Bengal assembly elections in 2016, he said it was not beneficial as ""sometimes alliances do not help and go against our own interest"".

The Congress leader conceded that uniting all opposition parties on one platform is not an easy task as ideological differences and reluctance to cede political space to each other often come in the way.

""Yes, votes get divided because of this. But who will make the sacrifice? Nobody will sacrifice. Why should we leave our seat when the other party doesn't? Yes, is will be better if things are done in the spirit of give and take, but that is not possible because of divergence and differences among us,"" he said.

Gogoi was responding to a question about division of secular votes in 2014 that helped BJP secure a majority in the Lok Sabha on its own, the strongest public mandate secured by any party since 1984 when the Congress had won a landslide.

""How much vote did they (BJP) get last time? Only 31 per cent. He (Modi) only gave an impression that he is the most popular prime minister. Probably, he is the only one to become the prime minister with lowest percentage of votes,"" Gogoi said.

When asked about Congress's failure to clinch an electoral pact with the CPM in West Bengal, the former chief minister said it was because the two were on the rival side of the political divide in Kerala.

""If we praise them here, how will we criticise them there?""

He, however, insisted all opposition parties were unanimous in their view that they must fight the Narendra Modi government's ""dictatorial and pro-rich"" policies.

The Congress veteran leader claimed the Centre's assertions on development were ""sheer propaganda"".

""Farm distress, job loss, slowdown in construction and manufacturing, failure to check price rise, fall in exports and decline in GDP....overall the the Indian economy is in a bad shape. Indications are that the country is on decline. It is not moving up, but going down,"" he claimed.

Gogoi was, however, optimistic about the Congress's prospects in the elections despite the opposition alliance failing to take off the way it should have.

""The Congress's prospects this time are very good. I think it will get around 200 seats. Indian people are intelligent. They would sometimes punish and then reward,"" he said, apparently the party's lowest ever tally of 44 seats in 2014 LS polls weighing on his mind.

He also maintained the BJP's tally in states like Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, where it had scored impressive victories like never before, will go down.

Education of girl child cries for attention: CRY study - Times of India

","
Lacunae in school infrastructure, paucity of qualified teachers and engagement in household chores impact education of girl child
While education of the girl child remains a key concern in the education sector and a number of girls enrolling in elementary schools have gone up in recent years, retention rates at the secondary and higher secondary levels present a dismal picture. A recent study by Child Rights and You (CRY) on 'Educating the Girl Child: Role of Incentivisation and Other Enablers and Disablers' found that girls' dependency on someone to go to school (90%) is the biggest disabler in attending schools. Reasons such as frequent absenteeism (29%), illness (52%) and being engaged in household chores (46%) were some of the other deterrents.





 Talking to Education Times about the study conducted in 1604 households across Haryana, Bihar, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, Puja Marwaha, CEO of CRY says, ""Net enrolment of girls in primary education stands at 85%, but retention drops to 31% by the time they reach higher secondary levels. This means, only 1 in every 3 girls in the country finish her school education age-appropriately (U-DISE Report 2016-17).""


Dropout rate

In all, around 70 % of girls dropped out of school in the age group of 15-18 years. ""In Haryana, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, menstruation has emerged as a crucial reason for missing school. Though 87% of schools have separate girls' toilet, they do not have running water and hand wash facilities,"" Marwaha says.

The survey revealed that 84% of girls were involved in household chores, 43% participate in family occupation while 6% are taking a vocational course. Over half of the dropout girls wanted to get back to schooling given an opportunity. ""Majority of the dropouts were first generation learners from ST and OBC category, with a family income of less than Rs 10,000 per month,"" adds Marwaha.


Scheme implementation

""While in recent years several schemes such as Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, scholarships for students with disabilities, Mukhyamantri Cycle Yojana, were introduced to improve enrolment and retention of girls, however, lack of mass awareness and timely disbursal of funds is preventing these schemes from being implemented,"" Marwaha says.

Gaps in policy implementation can be bridged by strengthening the implementation of the RTE Act and ensuring its extension to higher secondary education. ""Revisiting eligibility criteria to address issues of vulnerable girl children; gender sensitivity in pre-service and in-service teacher training and universalising crèche facilities can effectively plug in the gaps,"" Marwaha adds.

Pollution tied to psychotic episodes in teens: Study - Times of India

","
LONDON: High levels of air pollution in England and Wales have been linked with psychotic experiences in teenagers, such as hearing voices and intense paranoia, scientists said on Wednesday, as poor air quality in British cities comes under scrutiny.


Children and adolescents living in a city were twice as likely to experience a psychotic episode than those living in rural areas, said researchers at King’s College London, who described their study as the first of its kind in the country.

“We found that adolescent psychotic experiences were more common in urban areas,” said Joanne Newbury, lead author of the paper, published in the journal ‘JAMA Psychiatry’.

The researchers used data from a two-decade long study examining over 2,200 British children born in 1994-5, and compared it with national air pollution data from 2012, when the children would have been about 17 years old. About 30% of children reported at least one psychotic episode between the ages of 12 and 18, with the highest rates in cities with heavy exposure to nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen oxides and tiny air pollution particles, such as dust and smoke.

How a 100-yr-old instrument is wowing music lovers - Times of India

Enayat Khan’s beautiful old surbahar gets a new lease of life, thanks to his grandson
As unseasonal clouds gathered over the massive ramparts of Qila Mubarak, a question mark hung over the evening concert at the Patiala Heritage Festival. Would the rain hold off for the Khan string trio comprising brothers Irshad, Nishat and Wajahat to come together for a rare ensemble of surbahar, sitar and sarod?

As frantic parleys began, Irshad Khan sat in a corner of the green room, brows furrowed, and protective hands running tentatively over his surbahar. There was no way he could risk venturing out with his saaz, an heirloom of the Imdadkhani-Etawah gharana that goes back seven generations.

His surbahar had been crafted nearly 100 years ago at Kanailal and Brother, a legendary music shop on Kolkata’s Upper Chitpur Road in the Burrabazaar area whose illustrious clientele included Enayet Khan, Vilayat Khan, and Ravi Shankar.

Sometime in the early years of the last century, the surbahar-sitar genius, Ustad Enayet Khan, had stood over the luthiers at Kanailal and instructed them as they shaped this mighty surbahar, an instrument that’s often called the bass sitar. It had been an extravagant investment — somewhere between Rs 10,000-20,000, his son Imrat Khan, brother of the sitar maestro Vilayat Khan, was to later recall. Imrat handed it down to Irshad.

Beautiful and fragile, the squat surbahar with its almost flat tumba (gourd) is a work of art in itself, and if you heard its deep, mellow sounds, you could understand what the fuss was about.

In a television interview, Imrat Khan recounted the tale behind the survival of the antique instrument. Enayat Khan had died young, in 1936 at age 43, leaving the family in disarray. By 1942, with the threat of Japanese attack over Kolkata looming, life had got even tougher for the family.

The surbahar now stood forlorn. Vilayat Khan, at 14, had picked the sitar and was already a prodigy with it. Despite hardships, their mother, the doughty Bashiran Begum, refused to put the surbahar in the market. The matriarch then decided on its next owner — Imrat Khan, then all of seven. He went on to become one of the most renowned players of the instrument, often sitting in on a duet with his brother on the sitar.

Irshad says he himself was just a bit more than a toddler when he was started on the surbahar, impressing his father and uncle with the strength with which he pulled the strings. In a sort of historic parallel to his father and uncle’s choices, Nishat plays the sitar, while Irshad plays both the surbahar and sitar. Wajahat, the youngest, took to the sarod.

With its grand, low sounds — gambhir (serious) rasa, as Irshad puts it — the surbahar is increasingly fading from the popular classical landscape. Its grandeur shines through in grave ragas such as Malkauns and Darbari and when accompanied by the deep notes of the pakhawaj. The sitar is far more of a crowd pleaser, with its ebullient notes that lend themselves to fast taans and sawal jawab with the equally perky tabla.

“Contrary to popular views, the surbahar is not a big sitar. It is closer to the rudra veena — deeply resonant but a heavy, hard instrument to handle. This is why we are now down to half a dozen specialists. It takes a lot of riyaaz and hard work,” says veteran musicologist Lalita Khanna who recalls seeing the old surbahar in the Shimla home of Vilayat Khan.

Irshad has a doubly tough task of getting his grand old surbahar to stay in the fray. “It sounds great but its volume has declined over the decades. So playing it solo itself is hard work. Then if I play with another instrument, it becomes really problematic (because it will be barely audible). So imagine the balancing act of playing it with the sitar and the sarod and then having a pakhawaj and tabla in the mix,” he says.

Barely a fortnight before, the brothers had played their first trigalbandi (trio) at the NCPA in Mumbai to rave audience reviews. Irshad is still uncertain the almost centenarian surbahar could make itself heard in an ensemble. As it happened, rains did wash out the Patiala concert that evening.

But wrapping the antiquated surbahar in cotton-wool and leaving it on a shelf is the last thing Irshad wants to do. “There is no way you will get this sweetness of sound out of any other instrument. Given its special power, you have to literally wring the music in it. You actually need physical prowess to coax it,” he says. So while Irshad, who divides his time between Kolkata and Ontario, has a new surbahar, he is increasingly bringing out the heirloom to play at public concerts.

“I usually travel with both a surbahar and a sitar and play both or one. The surbahar, however, needs an audience that can sit, listen and savour music. This is not fast entertainment. It never can be,” he says.

1,100 dead dolphins washed up on French shores since January - Times of India

","
PARIS: The dolphins' bodies were horribly mutilated, the fins cut off.


But what shocked French marine researchers wasn't just the brutality of the deaths of these highly intelligent mammals, but also the numbers involved — a record 1,100 have washed up on France's Atlantic coast since January.

The mass deaths, widely blamed on aggressive industrial fishing, has alarmed animal welfare groups and prompted France's ecology minister to launch a national plan to protect them.

""There's never been a number this high,"" said Willy Daubin, a member of La Rochelle University's National Center for Scientific Research. ""Already in three months, we have beaten last year's record, which was up from 2017 and even that was the highest in 40 years.""

Though Daubin said 90 per cent of the fatalities resulted from accidental capture in industrial nets, the reason behind the spike this year is a mystery.

""What fishing machinery or equipment is behind all these deaths?"" he asked.

Autopsies carried out on the dolphins this year by La Rochelle University's National Centre for Scientific Research show extreme levels of mutilation.

Activists say a common practice is for fishermen to cut body parts off the suffocated dolphins after they are pulled up on the nets, to save the net itself.

French Ecology Minister Francois de Rugy rushed last Friday to La Rochelle in an attempt to lower the number dying as a result of human action. He's under pressure not least because of French President Emmanuel Macron's pro-ecology stance and oft-quoted slogan to ""Make the Planet Great Again"".

Rugy has come up with some plans, including bolstering research into existing acoustic repellent devices in place in some 26 two-vessel trawlers off the Bay of Biscay, an industrial fishing hub in the Atlantic Ocean. When activated, the devices send unpleasant signals to nearby dolphins that cause them to swim away.

But animal rights group Sea Shepherd said they do not go far enough, and has already decried such measures as ""useless"".

It claims many of the trawlers they watch in the region don't activate the repellent devices owing to fears they will scare off valuable fish as well, and operators only turn them on if they are checked by an ""onboard observer"".

It also said increasing the number of devices is no long-term solution for the underwater mammals as the move would make the ocean an uninhabitable drum of noise pollution.

""The government needs to take responsibility and act — especially Macron, who said he wanted to protect ecology,"" Lamya Essemlali, President of Sea Shepherd France, told The Associated Press.

She pointed to scientists who predict the current rates of fishing will likely drive the dolphin population to extinction.

""The spotlight has been put on the trawlers that fish for sea bass ..., which is a scandal. But they were not the only ones responsible."" She suggested that aggressive hake fishing, which was given the green light three years ago after long ban, was a major factor. The spike in dolphin deaths also began three years ago.

Sea Shepherd explained the ecological crisis as stemming from unprecedented demand for low-cost fish.

""Right now, the sea bass that is being caught by the trawlers that kill dolphins, you can find on the French market for 8 euros-per-kilo ($9),"" she said.

Global seafood consumption has more than doubled in the past 50 years, according to European Commission, a rate that rights groups have branded unsustainable.

BWF should focus on quality: Viktor Axelsen 

","
NEW DELHI: At 6 foot four and built like a door, Viktor Axelsen is surprisingly nimble on the court. With deception being part of the game, Axelsen has added one more trick to his backhand lift, which used to be the signature shot of Peter Gade Christensen. The 25-year old Dane attempted a lift and let the shuttle drop a bit more before actually sending it across the net. Suppanyu Avihingsanson was wrong-footed. The crowd at the IG Stadium roared in approval.


""Oh I enjoyed the support from the audience. I loved it when they called out my name. Buy I would prefer to play in front of a full house which I didn't see here,"" said the All-England finalist once the second round Thai opponent was taken to task.

Seeded top in India Open 2019 following Shi Yuki's pullout, the 2017 world champion is enjoying his badminton. Without making it obvious, he is also keeping an eye over his shoulder for Jan O Jorgensen, whose comeback is great news for Danish badminton.

Getting out of Jorgensen's shadow had never been an issue with Axelsen. It has similarities with the famous Waugh brothers' anecdote: the senior broke the news of junior's inclusion in the national team at his expense. Axelsen announced his arrival upstaging Jorgensen in the European championships.

Axelsen's talent has long been documented. Born in Odense, he became the first non-Asian player to win the U-19 world title as a 16-year-old in 2010. After a steep rise to stardom, a heel injury stopped him in his tracks before he had already won a World championship gold medal and an Olympic bronze.

Never one to shy away, Axelsen wants BWF to look into the number of tournaments that are mandatory for the players as injuries are mounting. ""I feel the world body should focus on the quality of tournaments rather than the number. That may ease out the problem.""

For now, Axelsen is chasing one more dream, the Olympic gold. The World championship title and being the world No. 1 have enhanced his belief that he can touch the sky. ""My biggest dream is to win Olympic gold. I'm definitely going to try my best to be in the best possible form at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics,"" he had said earlier.

And of course, there is the challenge thrown by Hugh Jackman - the Australian suggested that badminton is an easy sport. The Dane is waiting to hear from the Hollywood actor and in between picking up titles as and when possible. His second India Open crown is on the cards.

Pollitical comedy is booming - Times of India

","
PM Modi, sporting tattooed muscled arms, walks into the WWE ring. The crowd breaks into a cheer as he tackles Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav. The tackily edited video ends with a triumphant Yadav walking to victory. The clip has clearly fired people’s imagination, racking up 7.7 million views in the last couple of months.

Last week, a video about Congress president Rahul Gandhi styled as Gully Boy went viral too, helped along by Congress twitter handles. Stand-up comic Kunal Kamra’s scathing take on politics got 5.4 million views this week, while political satirist Akash Banerjee says he has added one lakh subscribers in the last 30 days.


Away from election rallies and neighbourhood chai pe charchas, online satire has boomed in the last couple of months. As Rahul Ram from Aisi Taisi Democracy sang recently, “Phir aaya hai time to choose… who will screw us more?’’ from his song Chunav ka maheena, a take-off from the popular 70s track Saavan ka maheena. But unlike the sharp satire interspersed with song that Aisi Taisi, a comedy collective comprising Sanjay Rajoura, Rahul Ram and Varun Grover is known for, most online comedy lampoons political leaders using Bollywood references. So with some deft editing, the same videos feature Modi, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and UP CM Yogi Adityanath alternatively as Gabbar Singh, Singham and Don.

“
Politics mein bhi entertainment hona chahiye. People are more keen to see Modi and Rahul, rather than Salman Khan and SRK,” says Lucknow-based Faizaan Siddiqui, whose studio made the Rahul Gandhi Gully Boy video.

Sixteen-year-old Hasnain Sheikh started making political spoofs as an escape from boredom. The schoolboy from Balasinor city near Ahmedabad made his first video on his mobile phone, which by his own admission was of terrible quality. But it got a lakh hits which made him sit up and get serious. His channel Spoof Xerox has since hosted parodies of Modi, Kejriwal and Akhilesh Yadav. “Anti-Modi videos get the most hits,’’ he says. Like Spoof Xerox, there are others like Politics Solitics and Hindi Mashup that are part of an ever growing spoof factory.

Akash Banerjee, a former journalist better known by his online avatar Bhakt Banerjee, boasts of half a million subscribers on his YouTube channel. Rather than merely lampooning or deifying leaders, Banerjee uses facts laced with dry humour to make his point. “Satire is powerful and I feel that it does influence votes. Hanste, hanste (While you are laughing) you make a deeper point, and if you can make someone see a divergent point of view, my job is done,” he says.

Banerjee says that a mainstream TV channel has expressed interest in hosting his videos indicating a growing acceptance of his brand of political critique.

So have Indians finally grown a funny bone? Or maybe comics have developed thicker skin? “People get abusive and threaten us. But I don’t get demoralised. I have realised that only people who don’t understand humour make negative comments,"" says Siddiqui.

Ram from Aisi Taisi feels that humour works better than rage. “Rage today is manufactured. Most people really don’t give a s***. 
Kissi ko itna rage na pehle hota than na aab (No one got so livid). It is just to discourage people from speaking up.’’ Siddiqui also feels that comics can influence political opinion. “
Comments padh kar lagta hai ke impact to padta hai (You realise you make an impact when you read the comments),"" he says. Ram, however, feels that influencing a vote would be a “reach”. “Satire can work as a rallying cry or a wake-up call. We are there to highlight the stupidities of society,’’ he says.

There are many reasons for the growing influence of political satire in India. For one, people have begun to question the integrity of mainstream media and celebrities, says Banerjee. The younger generation is also no longer interested in straitjacketed news. They would like it condensed and fact-checked, but raw and without baggage or bias. There is a large NRI audience as well that is invested in the country.

Are we moving towards the American tradition of late night satire where shows pack in factual news with tongue-in-cheek commentary? These are early days yet, feels Banerjee. But the satirist as a public intellectual is a role that some ‘’comics’’ are taking on. In a scathing comment on today’s politics, Kamra recounts an encounter with a politician who condescendingly tells him, ‘’Go ahead, do comedy but leave politics for us.’’ Kamra says,”Sir, 
aap pe hi chhoda tha. Par aap log comedy kar rahe ho (We had left the politics to you, but you started doing comedy).’’ The proof of the growing appetite for political comedy is in the numbers. US-based Indianorigin comic Hasan Minhaj recently dropped an episode on the Indian election that raked in 1.7 million views on YouTube in just four days. To put this in perspective, the only episode of his show ‘Patriot Act’ that has surpassed this was one where he described the power and fortunes of the Saudi royal family in light of the Washington Post correspondent Jamal Khashoggi killing, four months ago.

Banerjee says that platforms like You-Tube are not built for creators but for advertisers. ""Unfortunately, advertisers are scared of political content. If you talk of Dalit violence or cow lynching, it is not considered ad friendly,"" he says.

Right now, satirists can’t even imagine being free enough to speak openly, without the need to ‘’balance"" and criticise all political parties. Banerjee says, ""I work with the knowledge that I might be hounded or shut down any time. You can’t do what is being done in the late shows in the US. You will probably be shot dead if you did or said what they are doing.’

Oppo Reno: Oppo Reno alleged leak shows a wedge-shaped pop-up selfie camera - Times of India

","
Oppo’ upcoming smartphone lineup under the new sub-brand Reno has been making a buzz recently. It is now rumoured to come with a pop-up camera that wedges out from one side. This wedge-shaped camera houses the selfie camera along with the LED flash. This new set of information come from the case images shared by SlashLeaks. 

The back of the smartphone can be seen sporting a vertically aligned dual rear camera. LED flash is placed below the camera setup. Further, the company’s VP Brian Shen has revealed that the smartphone will feature a variant powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 SoC processor. He took to the Chinese microblogging site Weibo to share the information. 

It is important to note here that earlier reports suggest that Oppo Reno may be powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 710 processor. Therefore, it may be concluded that while the standard variant will sport Snapdragon 710, the higher variant could be powered by Snapdragon 855. 

The leaked case renders also suggest that the phone will include a 3.5mm headphone jack, USB Type-C port and a speaker grille at the bottom. 


Oppo Reno: Expected specifications

The upcoming smartphone is expected to come with a 6.4-inch display. The dual-lens camera at the back may consists of 48-megapixel primary sensor and a 5-megapixel secondary sensor. 

Earlier leaks suggest that the smartphone will be available in different colour options - Green, Black, Purple and Pink. Further, the handset is expected to offer 10X hybrid zoom capabilities showcased by Oppo at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2019. It is also expected that the handset will be launched in China in April this year, though the exact date is yet not known.

MI vs RCB 2019: Umpires should keep their eyes open, this is not club cricket, says Virat Kohli; Rohit Sharma agrees 

","
BANGALORE: An angry Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Virat Kohli came down heavily on ICC Elite Panel Umpire S Ravi after the final delivery of the match bowled by Mumbai Indians' Lasith Malinga turned out to be a 'no-ball', which was not awarded to the losing team.


More importantly, winning captain Rohit Sharma was also critical of umpiring standard during the match.

""We are playing at the IPL level. It's not club level, the umpires should have their eyes open. That was a big no-ball. That is a ridiculous call (last ball). If it is a game of margins, I don't know what is happening. They should have been more sharp and careful out there,"" a livid Kohli said at the post-match presentation ceremony.

Incidentally, Ravi is the only Indian umpire in ICC's Elite Panel for a number of years now as none of the others have been good enough to be elevated.

Needing 7 to win and six to take it to Super Over, Malinga's full toss yielded only one run but the big screen replay showed that the bowler had overstepped and a free hit should have been awarded.

Had it been a free-hit, AB de Villiers batting on 70 would have faced with five needed to win.

""We should have done a better job with the ball after they were seven down. The last few overs were brutal for us. Bit of a mistake from me to take Bumrah on at that time. Bumrah makes a hell of a difference in any team,"" the RCB skipper praised his India teammate.

Winning captain Rohit also voiced his concerns about umpiring.

""Honestly, I just go to know after crossing the rope that it was a no-ball. These kind of mistakes aren't good for the game. The over before that Bumrah bowled, a ball which wasn't a wide but it was called,"" Rohit referred to a decision given by other umpire C Nandan.

""Anything over 180 you can fight with. It wasn't a safe score but we had the bowlers to get the job done. Even though Virat and AB had a partnership going, we didn't panic. I thought we stuck to our plans, it was a great effort by the bowlers. Should have got 200 with the bat on this pitch.""

Instagram video feature: You may soon be able to scroll through an Instagram video, rewind it and more - Times of India

","
Instagram, the popular photo and video sharing app owned by Facebook is getting a much-needed feature it seems. Soon, the app might let you quickly jump to a particular second in a video or rewind it, something we are not able to do just yet. For now, one would have to go through the entire video at once or play it again if they missed a part. The new feature of jumping to a particular second inside the video is possible due to a video seek bar, which showed up in an Instagram apk file according to a developer named @wongmjane.

Wong showcased the new feature in a gif video in a tweet stating ‘Instagram is testing video seek bar’. The video shows how one can simply tap on the video timeline running on top of the particular post and drag it to the particular part of interest. If Instagram is indeed testing this feature, it could come as a welcome change for many but on the downside would reduce the engagement time for video posts. There is no confirmation yet if this feature will be reaching to the masses or if it’s under tests.


Instagram is testing video seekbar https://t.co/gyIZZhrh2y— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) 1553721672000

For what’s worth, this is not the first time that this feature has been spotted. Instagram apparently showed us a glimpse of it back in January last year as well. “Stumbled across the fact that you can now fast forward & rewind Instagram videos last night. Simply press & hold on the screen then move your finger. Don’t think this has been out long. #Social,” tweeted @theJBECK in January 2018.

Talking about testing new features, recently Instagram was spotted testing selector wheel format to show different filter options for ‘Stories’. The semi-circular wheel was also spotted by the same developer. “Instagram is working on new 'Stories' user-interface, inspired from mechanical circular mode switcher in DSLRs. Tabs reduced to just 'Live', 'Normal' and 'Create',"" Wong tweeted.

Man faces hate crime charge after throwing hot coffee, punching Sikh clerk in US - Times of India

","
NEW YORK: A man was arrested on hate crime charges in the US state of California after he punched a Sikh clerk and threw hot coffee on him as he believed the victim was a Muslim, according to a media report. The man, identified as John Crain, threw the hot coffee at the clerk then punched him in the face before fleeing just before 2 am on Wednesday in Marysville, the Sacramento Bee reported. 


The Sikh clerk told officers that Crain had prepared himself a cup of coffee and attempted to leave without paying, according to a Marysville Police Department press release. 

He is seen in the CCTV footage confronting Crain at the front door before being attacked. The victim suffered injuries from the hot coffee, as well as a contusion on his face, police said. 

Police said officers were dispatched to the same store later that afternoon for another reported assault and spotted Crain walking away from the area. 

Later that day, officers responded to another assault in the area and found a suspect walking away matching the description of the man from the earlier incident. The suspect was arrested. 

Crain admitted to the officers that he had assaulted the clerk during the previous night's incident. 

He told police he ""hated Muslims"" and attacked the Sikh clerk because he believed he's Muslim. He was later booked into Yuba County Jail for theft, assault and hate crimes charges. 

The Council on American-Islamic Relations and its allies from the Sikh community condemned the attack. 

""We condemn this attack on an individual because of his faith. This hate crime represents yet another attack on our Sikh brothers and sisters fuelled by Islamophobia and those emboldened by this administration's xenophobic policies and sentiments,"" CAIR-SV's Civil Rights Attorney Saad Sweilem said in a statement. 

""We welcome the hate crime charges and encourage law enforcement to continue to take these clear incidents of bias seriously.""

Ocean heat hits record high: UN - Times of India

","
GENEVA: Ocean heat hit a record high in 2018, the United Nations said Thursday, raising urgent new concerns about the threat global warming is posing to marine life.


In its latest State of the Climate overview, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reaffirmed that the last four years had been the hottest on record — figures previously announced in provisional drafts of the flagship report.

But the final version of the report highlighted worrying developments in other climate indicators beyond surface temperature.

""2018 saw new records for ocean heat content in the upper 700 metres,"" a WMO statement said.

The agency said the UN had data for heat content in the upper 700 metres (2,290 feet) of the ocean dating back to 1955.

Last year also saw new heat records for the ocean's upper 2,000 metres, but data for that range only goes back to 2005.

The previous records for both ranges were set in 2017.

About 93 per cent of excess heat — trapped around the Earth by greenhouse gases that come from the burning of fossil fuels — accumulates in the world's oceans.

Research published earlier this year in the US journal Science showed that warming in the oceans is on pace with measurements of rising air temperature.

Some models predict the temperature of the top 2,000 metres of world's oceans will rise nearly 0.8 degrees Celsius by the end of the century if nothing is done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, according to Science.

Oceans are also not warming evenly across the planet.

The WMO report said the highest rates of ocean warming are occurring in the southern ocean, where warming has also reached the deepest layers.

This could result in sea levels being substantially different in different places, experts have previously said.

The thermal expansion — water swelling as it warms — is expected to raise sea levels 12 inches (30 centimetres), above any sea level rise from melting glaciers and ice sheets, according to the research published in Science.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who launched the WMO report in New York, said its findings confirmed ""the urgency of climate action"".

""There is no longer any time for delay,"" he warned, stressing that nations needed to come to his Climate Action Summit in September with ""concrete, realistic plans"" to reduce emissions. (AFP)

A school course to cultivate human values 

","
NEW DELHI: Dalai Lama Trust, Emory University (USA) and Vana Foundation will launch on April 4 SEE Learning (Social, Emotional and Ethical Learning) — the culmination of more than two decades of educational collaboration between the Dalai Lama and Emory University, Atlanta.


This event, which will be on till April 6 in Delhi, will be presided over by Nobel Peace laureate the Dalai Lama and will include Kailash Satyarthi, another Nobel Peace laureate, and globally-recognised experts in social and emotional learning such as Daniel Goleman, Kimberly Schonert-Reichl and Robert Roeser.

The curricula, which will be internationally accessible, will be translated in 14 languages, including Hindi, English, French, Russian, German and Chinese. It has four modules covering early elementary grades to high school.

SEE Learning is a new education programme developed at Emory University in Atlanta, USA with the help of experts in developmental psychology, education and neuroscience, as well as with the vision and support of the Dalai Lama. The programme is a comprehensive framework for the cultivation of social, emotional and ethical competencies as well as age-specific curricula for K-12 schools and a programme support structure for educator preparation and development. 

In his foreword to SEE Learning Companion, the Dalai Lama has said “to involve the whole of humanity, we need an ethical approach with universal appeal, a secular ethics that nurtures such basic human values as empathy, tolerance, forgiveness and love”. 

Recent research has shown that such values can be cultivated through learning and practice on the basis of common sense, experience and scientific findings, he added. “They can be integrated in heart and mind not through the enforcement of rules, but through the voluntary application of reason and investigation.”

With the vision of “a compassionate and ethical world for all”, SEE Learning is the first social and emotional learning programme to explicitly focus on the cultivation of compassion, other basic human values and “ethical intelligence”, provide developmentally appropriate methods for attention training, include “system thinking” at all levels of education and incorporate a resilience and trauma-informed approach.

Computer tool predicts risk of deadly irregular heart beats - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: Scientists have developed a computer system that can accurately predict which patients with a rare heart condition will suffer from a potentially fatal events, and whether they may benefit from life-saving implanted devices.


The tool, developed by researchers at Johns Hopkins University in the US, may help avoid unnecessary -- and potentially risky -- surgeries to place the devices.

An estimated 1 in 5,000 people have arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), a complex, multigene, inherited disease of the lower heart chambers that can cause deadly arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats. Although rare, it is a very frequent cause of sudden death in young adults, researchers said. The average age of diagnosis is 31, although it can emerge from adolescence through middle age.

ARVC can be effectively managed in many cases with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), a device that detects electrical abnormalities in heart muscle and immediately shocks the heart to re-establish normal rhythm.

ICDs prevent sudden cardiac death and save lives. However, these devices come with risks and side effects, said Cynthia A James, assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins University.

The devices may deliver inappropriate shocks when patients are not experiencing life-threatening arrhythmias. The ICD itself or pacemaker leads placed in the heart to deliver a shock may fail over time, necessitating replacement with surgery.

Infections brought on by these devices -- and even just wearing out the device's battery with time -- also require replacement, hospitalisations and expense, she added.

""Because patients develop this condition at such a young age, they typically need several ICD replacements over the course of their lives,"" said James.

""For ARVC patients, getting an ICD is a big decision with serious consequences,"" she said.

While physicians are generally in agreement that patients who experience a life-threatening arrhythmia qualify for an ICD, it has been unclear whether patients who have not yet experienced this event should get one for prevention.

Researchers pooled medical record data from 528 patients in five registries based at 14 academic medical centres in the US and Europe.

The group was nearly evenly split between male and female and between North America and Europe. None had yet experienced a life-threatening arrhythmia.

Then, using risk factors derived from published previous studies, researchers developed a computer-based mathematical set of consistent rules to try to predict whether any of the 528 patients might undergo a serious arrhythmia over time.

Over nearly five years of follow-up, just over a quarter of these patients experienced a dangerous arrhythmia, and 18 patients died.

The researchers found that their model accurately accounted for which patients would have life-threatening events. No patient with a five-year, model-predicted risk of five per cent or less had a serious arrhythmia.

More than 95 per cent of arrhythmias occurred in people with at least a 15 per cent five-year risk.

When the researchers compared their prediction accuracy rates with outcomes using a current consensus-based ICD placement algorithm, they found that about 20.6 per cent of recommended ICD placements would have likely been unnecessary.

""We believe our findings and the risk calculator we have developed have the potential to contribute to personalised medicine and to high value health care efforts emerging throughout medical care,"" said Hugh Calkins, professor at the Johns Hopkins University.

Researchers said it can cost $20,000 to implant an ICD and a similar amount of money to replace the device when the battery wears out five to 10 years later.

Mamata Banerjee: 'He is just a kid': Mamata scoffs at Rahul Gandhi's allegations - Times of India

","
KOLKATA: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday dismissed Congress chief Rahul Gandhi's allegations against her government, saying ""he is just a kid"".


She also refused to comment on Gandhi's minimum income promise ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.

""He (Gandhi) has said whatever he felt like. I won't like to make any comment on it. He is just a kid. What will I say about it?"" Banerjee said.

Launching his party's Lok Sabha poll campaign in the state, Gandhi had accused both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Trinamool Congress chief of failing to fulfil the promises of the people.

At a rally in Malda, Rahul had alleged that nothing has changed in Bengal as there has been no development in the state under Banerjee.

Asked to comment on Gandhi's poll promise of minimum income, she said ""They (Congress) have made an announcement and it would not be right for us to make a comment on it.""

Gandhi had called his party's announcement as the ""final assault"" and a ""surgical strike"" on poverty.

The Congress and the Trinamool Congress share a strained relation in the state after fighting the 2011 polls together and uprooting the 34-year-old Left Front regime.

Although the Congress have shared stage with the TMC at the national level, in Bengal it has maintained a distance with Banerjee's party, which was born out of it in 1998.

Congress' state unit has time and again accused the TMC of trying to ""politically finish"" it either by use of force or by poaching its leaders and elected representatives.

As many as 17 Congress MLAs and one MP have switched over to the TMC in Bengal since the state elections of 2016.

After Congress' victory in the three Hindi-heartland states last year, Banerjee stopped short of congratulating either the Congress or Gandhi by their names, drawing sharp reactions.

Senior state Congress leaders had then asked if Trinamool Congress leaders were having ""sleepless nights"" fearing that their dream of Mamata Banerjee becoming the prime minister may not be fulfilled.

I felt like Stuart Broad when Yuvraj Singh walloped me for three successive sixes: Yuzvendra Chahal 

","
BENGALURU: Royal Challengers Bangalore spinner Yuzvendra Chahal said he felt like Stuart Broad when Mumbai Indians' veteran swashbuckler Yuvraj Singh smashed three sixes in one of his overs.


Yuvraj struck Chahal for consecutive sixes in the 14th over of the match which Mumbai won by six runs on Thursday night.


POINTS TABLE | 
SCHEDULE

""When he (Yuvraj) hit three sixes, I felt like Stuart Broad,"" Chahal said referring to the six consecutive maximums in the 2007 T20 World Cup that Yuvraj had hit off Englishman Broad.

However, Chahal managed to get Yuvraj off the fourth delivery of his over, caught by Mohammad Siraj in the deep after he had scored a quick-fire 23 off 12 balls.

""You know he is a legend batsman and I backed myself. I had to bowl a bit up, might be a chance to get him out because it is a smaller ground. So that time, I thought of bowling my best delivery and he got sixes. That you cannot help and hence I bowled a wider googly,"" he told reporters in post-match session.

On September 19, 2007, in a World T20 match in Durban, Yuvraj had scripted a carnage by walloping six sixes off Broad in an over during a 16-ball 58.

Speaking about the wicket, Chahal said since it was good for batting, he varied his pace, especially for the big-hitting Kieron Pollard.

""The wicket was not turning. It was good for batting. So, the plan was to vary my pace, like bowling slower ones and sometimes sliders too,"" he said.

IPL 2019 Live streaming: When, where, how to watch and follow SRH vs RR live 

","
NEW DELHI: 'Mankaded' in their opening match, Rajasthan Royals would look to resurrect their fortunes in Friday's IPL clash against Sunrisers Hyderabad, who would also be aiming to put behind a disappointing opener.


Rajasthan's campaign started on a controversial note when Jos Buttler became the first cricketer in the IPL to be 'Mankaded', the practice of running out non-strikers, who back up early, by bowlers on their delivery stride.

Here are the details of when, where and how you can or follow all the action of the eighth match of IPL 12 to be played at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.

For all the ball-by-ball updates and live commentary you can keep a tab on TOI Sports' live blog and live updates well before the first ball is bowled.


What: IPL 12 - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Rajasthan RoyalsWhen: March 29, 2019Where: Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, HyderabadTime: 8:00 pm (IST) PREVIEW
From Rajasthan Royals, Steve Smith, who returned to the IPL after missing the last edition following the ball-tampering scandal, would be eyeing more time at the crease ahead of the upcoming ODI World Cup.

Dhawal Kulkarni and spinner Krishnappa Gowtham were brilliant upfront with the ball against Kings XI, but Stokes and Jaydev Unadkat leaked runs. Pacer Jofra Archer, who gave away just 17 runs in his four overs, looked threatening but wickets eluded him.

Just like Rajasthan, Sunrisers too didn't have a dream start to their campaign, losing by six wickets to Kolkata Knight Riders.

While the David Warner-led Sunrisers' batting looked solid, the death bowling performance spoiled their chances against KKR.

And Sunrisers' know their chances heavily depend on Warner's success even though they also have the likes of skipper Kane Williamson, Jonny Bairstow, Vijay Shankar, Manish Pandey, Yusuf Pathan and Shakib Al Hasan in their ranks.

Karnataka: Bride throws up, groom gets virginity test done 

","
BENGALURU: An unwell bride who threw up minutes after tying the knot was allegedly made to undergo virginity and pregnancy tests by her spouse without her knowledge. The woman has taken her husband to court for suspecting her fidelity and harassing her. 


 The HR professional has not admitted to his mistake during counselling sessions conducted by Aparna Purnesh, a counsellor at Parihar family counselling centre (Vanitha Sahayavani) attached to Bengaluru city police. 

According to Sahayavani sources, the couple from North Karnataka - Sharath, 29, and Raksha, 26, (names changed) - who are MBA graduates and employed with reputed firms, met on a matrimonial site. After a few days of interaction, they decided to marry in November 2018.

Fifteen days before marriage, Raksha lost her mother to cancer. As Raksha went into depression, Sharath thought she wasn't happy with the marriage. 


Woman signed consent forms without checking

Meanwhile, Raksha spoke to one of her friends from her hometown, who supported her during tough times. Here too, Sharath mistook her.

On the day of marriage, Raksha vomited due to gastritis and Sharath immediately took her to a hospital. While Raksha assumed she was taken to hospital due to gastritis, she was in for a shock when she realised in the ward room that doctors were testing her for pregnancy and virginity.

Soon after the tests, Raksha lashed out at Sharath before leaving for her sister’s house, where she started staying. Three months later, Sharath came to the Parihar family counselling centre and filed a complaint against his wife. To defuse the marital dispute, the centre summoned Raksha. But counsellors were shocked to learn of ordeals Raksha went through.

“Raksha told us she did not know she was being put through virginity and pregnancy tests and that she signed the consent forms without looking into the details. She got to know about the tests only when they were almost done. On Raksha’s request, the centre tried to counsel Sharath but he did not respond,” Aparna told TOI.

Raksha has filed complaints with police and court against Sharath for harassment and suspecting her fidelity. The husband has filed for divorce.

Rani Shetty, coordinator of the counselling centre, said, “Raksha’s father passed away long ago and she lost her mother a few days before marriage. Instead of consoling her, Sharath misunderstood her and subjected her to tests without consent, which is illegal. We are providing her necessary assistance from the centre.”

'Serial offender, apologist': India makes veiled reference to Pakistan as UN moves against terror financing 

","
UNITED NATIONS: In a veiled reference to Pakistan, India said countries that are ""apologists for terrorists"" will continue to provide ""alibis"" justifying their actions and inaction, as it called on the Security Council to ensure crucial sanctions measures against the UN proscribed terrorists and entities are strictly enforced.


The Security Council on Thursday unanimously adopted a resolution calling upon Member States to step up efforts to combat and criminalise the financing of terrorists and their activities.

India welcomed the adoption of the resolution, describing it a ""milestone"" in global efforts to set up a normative framework to criminalise terrorist financing.

India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin, participating in the Security Council open debate on 'Preventing and Combating the Financing of Terrorism', said New Delhi specifically welcomes the recognition in the resolution of the essential role of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in setting global standards, especially in the context of preventing and combating money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing.

Akbaruddin, however, asserted that the Council ""can and needs"" to do a better job of overseeing the implementation of its resolutions relating to terrorist financing and of the various sanctions measures under the 1267 Al- Qaida and 1988 sanctions regimes.

India warned that ""non-compliance of crucial sanctions measures in case of the UN proscribed terrorists and entities renders all of us, Member States, at a high risk of facing challenges from these terrorist organisations who are well funded and armed despite international measures.""

""As the saying goes, the proof of the pudding is in its eating, the utility of any council resolution will, therefore, be in its implementation,"" he said.

""Also, the unfortunate reality is that States who are apologists for terrorists will continue to provide alibis to justify their actions and inaction too, as was done by a serial offender earlier today,"" he said, a veiled reference to Pakistan.

Pakistan's Ambassador to the UN Maleeha Lodhi, in her statement during that debate, said that it is important that the FATF and the 1267 sanctions regimes are ""not used as political tools by some to advance their geo-political objectives."" She also made a reference to Jammu and Kashmir in her statement.

Akbaruddin asserted that the international community needs to be determined to ""continue evolving our tool box and go by our rule book, rather than be distracted and stray from our determination. Our tool box consisting of effective implementation of UN sanctions measures could assist in curtailing these activities in some measure.""

Describing terrorism as a scourge that is tearing at the fabric of societies across the globe, Akbaruddin said it is a menace that is not quarantined to any region.

""People now live in fear of terrorist threats in countries across the world. Combating Terrorism is viewed by many States and their people as one of the most fundamental security policy priorities that require global responsiveness,"" he said, calling the adoption of the resolution an answer to ""a felt need.""

""The global community is impatient for action. The UN collectively needs to do more and do it much more effectively. For its part, India will be a willing partner in this endeavour,"" he said at the open debate convened by France under its Presidency of the Security Council for the month of March.

Akbaruddin further highlighted that many Council resolutions, including the various sanctions measures under the 1267 and 1988 sanctions regimes, where asset freeze is a core part of states' obligations call for regular reporting under these measures.

While welcoming the resolution's focus on ensuring full compliance with the measures imposed by the Security Council, Akbaruddin voiced concern that no effective action is taken on instances of reported non-compliance with the sanctions measures.

He pointed out that the report of the 1267 sanctions Monitoring team dated January 15, 2019 notes that Member States have reported to the Monitoring Team, on an ad hoc basis and a comprehensive review of frozen assets has not been undertaken. He expressed hope that there will action on this front by member states.

""We welcome the Council and its various bodies taking note and rectifying instances of non-implementation to enhance awareness and effective implementation of the various council resolutions on Counter Terrorism. We believe that this work could be strengthened with more cooperation between the FATF and the various UN entities…""

""Bodies such as the FATF have listed risks posed by Da'esh, Al- Qaida, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, Falah-i-Insaniyat Foundation, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Haqqani Network, and persons affiliated with the Taliban,"" he added.

By other terms of the resolution, all States shall — in a manner consistent with their obligations under international law — ensure that their laws and regulations make it possible to prosecute and penalise, as serious criminal offences, the provision or collection of funds, resources and services intended to be used for the benefit of terrorist organisations or individual terrorists.

The resolution also calls upon Member States to conduct financial investigations into terrorism-related cases and to more effectively investigate and prosecute cases of terrorist financing, applying criminal sanctions as appropriate.

Indian-origin man jailed for bomb hoax in Singapore - Times of India

","
SINGAPORE: An Indian-origin man was jailed for four months for a 2004 bomb hoax at the house of Singapore's first prime minister late Lee Kuan Yew.


Ganesan Singaravel, 61, pleaded guilty to an offence under the Telecommunications Act, reported The New Paper Tuesday.

Ganesan drank alcohol till early morning on November 13, 2004, at a popular spot in Orchard Tower on Singapore's hotel belt of Orchard Road and then made a call from public telephone booth to the police, making reference to a bomb at Yew's house.

Deputy Public Prosecutor Benjamin Samynathan on Monday told the court, ""The call was made by the accused from a public phone located next to the Thai Embassy (also on Orchard Road). The call's message was clearly false, and the accused knew that the text of the call was false.

""A (police) patrol car was sent to Orchard Towers to interview and arrest the accused. He was coherent during his interactions with the officers at the scene. Meanwhile, the officers who were already stationed at Oxley Road (Lee's house) were told to step up patrols and be alert and vigilant.""

Ganesan was charged on November 16, 2004, but he fled Singapore about two months later while on bail.

Last year, he was caught overstaying in the US. He told the authorities there that he wanted to return to Singapore. Subsequently, he was detained on his arrival here on July 15.

Defence lawyers -- Ravinderpal Singh and James Ow Yong -- stated in their mitigation plea that their client was drunk when he committed the offence.

The plea also stated, ""The accused realises how alcohol has utterly destroyed his life and family, leading to his wife to divorce him, leaving him with nothing and his children to give up on him. The accused's family no longer wants anything to do with him.

""The offence has taken a terrible toll on the accused.""

MI vs RCB 2019: Umpires should keep their eyes open, this is not club cricket, says Virat Kohli; Rohit Sharma agrees 

","
BANGALORE: An angry Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Virat Kohli came down heavily on ICC Elite Panel Umpire S Ravi after the final delivery of the match bowled by Mumbai Indians' Lasith Malinga turned out to be a 'no-ball', which was not awarded to the losing team.


More importantly, winning captain Rohit Sharma was also critical of umpiring standard during the match.


POINTS TABLE | 
SCHEDULE

""We are playing at the IPL level. It's not club level, the umpires should have their eyes open. That was a big no-ball. That is a ridiculous call (last ball). If it is a game of margins, I don't know what is happening. They should have been more sharp and careful out there,"" a livid Kohli said at the post-match presentation ceremony.

Incidentally, Ravi is the only Indian umpire in ICC's Elite Panel for a number of years now as none of the others have been good enough to be elevated.

Needing 7 to win and six to take it to Super Over, Malinga's full toss yielded only one run but the big screen replay showed that the bowler had overstepped and a free hit should have been awarded.

Had it been a free-hit, AB de Villiers batting on 70 would have faced with five needed to win.

""We should have done a better job with the ball after they were seven down. The last few overs were brutal for us. Bit of a mistake from me to take Bumrah on at that time. Bumrah makes a hell of a difference in any team,"" the RCB skipper praised his India teammate.

Winning captain Rohit also voiced his concerns about umpiring.

""Honestly, I just go to know after crossing the rope that it was a no-ball. These kind of mistakes aren't good for the game. The over before that Bumrah bowled, a ball which wasn't a wide but it was called,"" Rohit referred to a decision given by other umpire C Nandan.

""Anything over 180 you can fight with. It wasn't a safe score but we had the bowlers to get the job done. Even though Virat and AB had a partnership going, we didn't panic. I thought we stuck to our plans, it was a great effort by the bowlers. Should have got 200 with the bat on this pitch.""

PM Theresa May makes final push on EU divorce deal, vote likely today - Times of India

","
LONDON: British PM Theresa May made a final push on Thursday to save her European Union withdrawal agreement after her promise to step down gained the deal some support but failed to win over lawmakers from Northern Ireland.


The government announced there would be a previously unscheduled Brexit debate in Parliament on Friday - but did not confirm whether it would include a new vote on May's twice-rejected EU divorce agreement. The EU has said the PM must secure approval for her deal by 11pm (UK time) on Friday if the UK is to be given an automatic delay of its departure date from the bloc until May 22.

Otherwise, Britain has until April 12 to announce a new plan, or leave the bloc without a deal. Announcing Friday's debate, House of Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom did not say whether it would include a vote on May's deal. Commons Speaker John Bercow has said the government can't bring the rejected deal back a third time unless it has been changed.

May pledged on Wednesday that she would resign if her Brexit deal was approved, in hopes of blunting opposition from those who have criticised her leadership.

In a first, IIM Ahmedabad students get MBA degree - Times of India

","
AHMEDABAD: The 54th convocation of Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM-A) on Saturday was historic for the institute and students. After over half a century, the students were awarded a degree of Master of Business Administration (MBA) instead of Post-Graduate Programme (PGP) in Management diploma.


Country’s premier management institution awarded its first masters degree after the IIM Act-2017 became a law in December 2017. IIM Bangalore and Calcutta also conferred MBA degrees in their last convocation. Sources said previous students too wanted a similar degree with retrospective effect, but the institute said the move is not possible.







However, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad is now also planning to increase the course fee for its MBA program. IIM-A director Errol D’Souza said the Governing Council had approved fee hike of 4.5%; the MBA course would now cost students Rs 22 lakh instead of Rs 21 lakh. “The decision has been taken keeping in mind the inflation rate,” said the director.

Priyanka Gandhi: Should I fight from Varanasi, Priyanka Gandhi asks party workers 

","
NEW DELHI: It was a stock query for 

  Priyanka Gandhi Vadra
 + , but one that elicited an unexpected answer. ""Varanasi se lad lun (should I contest from Varanasi?)"" - Priyanka's response to a party worker's query at a meeting in Rae Bareli on Thursday immediately set off fevered political speculation.


The comment is being interpreted in various ways. It could be mere repartee devoid of any deeper intent or could reveal a desire to take the electoral plunge. After all, it came a day after she answered the same question, saying that if the party felt so, she would be all too 

  happy to contest the election
 + .

The brief remark was enough to set a buzz and get the media interested, given that the temple town of Varanasi is the constituency of PM Narendra Modi.

According to reports, the comment came at a Congress workers' meeting in Rae Bareli fromn where Sonia Gandhi is to contest once again, with a group insisting that Priyanka fight the polls. The implied suggestion, a party source said, could be that she could step into her mother's shoes.

However, they were in for a shock when Priyanka turned back and asked how if she contested from Varanasi. While making it clear that she was open to contesting, she has also made it a point to add that her personal wish was to work for the party organisation as a lot of work had to be done.

Ever since Priyanka took the political plunge in January, the latest Gandhi to do so, there has been speculation if she would also make an electoral debut. With Sonia running again from her constituency and brother Rahul in Amethi, the possibility of her going to Varanasi ""to tie down the PM to his seat"" has been doing the rounds in party circles.

Priyanka's own allusion to Varanasi is set to stoke this speculation which, given its sensational implication, may set the political campaign abuzz. As the news spread, a party sympathiser claimed that even in 2014, Priyanka had toyed with the idea of taking on Modi, BJP's then prime ministerial nominee. However, the plan was shelved.

Given the charge of rejuvenating Congress in Uttar Pradesh, Priyanka is on a tour of the family turf of Amethi and Rae Bareli. She will visit Ayodhya on Friday before returning to the capital.

Prosecutors couldn’t get any bank CEO. I was a convenient high-profile guy: Rajat Gupta - Times of India

","
As the first (and still only) Indian to head consultancy firm McKinsey & Company globally, Rajat Gupta was a role model for the diaspora. He counted statesmen, tycoons and international celebrities as friends, served on the boards of corporations like Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble, was an advisor to non-profits such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and co-founded the Indian School of Business. His glittering career collapsed after he was convicted on charges of insider trading in collusion with billionaire hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam. Gupta wanted to testify in his own defence but was dissuaded from doing so by his legal team — a decision he still regrets. Having served 19 months in jail, Gupta has finally narrated his side of the story in a book, ‘Where The Mind Is Without Fear’. Ahead of its launch, he spoke exclusively to TOI’s Surojit Gupta & Vikas Singh. Excerpts:


ON THE TRIAL

Would you summarise your version of the events as follows: A series of unfortunate coincidences created a situation that looked far worse than it actually was. Even then, the evidence against you was circumstantial at best, but your lawyers gave you bad advice?

It’s a fair summary but I would also add that there were different incentives for different players. The prosecutors never really got to anybody who was responsible for the financial crisis of 2008. They couldn’t get any of the bank CEOs, and I happened to be a convenient high-profile guy. Even during Rajaratnam’s trial, I was being tried without being able to defend myself, even though I hadn’t been formally charged. So they created a certain public opinion, and I would say it was quite proactive and deliberate on their part.


Do you regret not taking the stand and giving your version?
Yes, definitely. But I don’t think the outcome necessarily would have been different. I have to say the prosecution did a great job of confusing the whole story with unnecessary details.


But the coincidence of you making a call to Rajaratnam within seconds of a Goldman Sachs board meeting concluding was rather remarkable… The obvious inference was that you gave him an insider tip.

But I used to call people within seconds after every board meeting. My life was so hectic, I called people whenever I got a chance. I had invested money in a fund run by Raj, which was eventually lost, and was looking for information on it. Look at the call records. I called my secretary and asked, ‘Did Raj provide the information?’ She said no, and I said, ‘Get me Raj’. If I was going to do something illegal, would I route the call through my secretary? Even Lloyd Blankfein (then Goldman Sachs CEO) said on the stand that he makes calls after he comes out of every board meeting.


The judge would not allow your philanthropic work to be mentioned at all during the trial but he took it into consideration during sentencing.
There were lots of things which didn’t make any sense to me. My personal banker had made two pages of notes on my post-retirement plans. The first referred to my projected income. It mentioned I would be involved in Galleon International, with Rajaratnam, which I never was eventually. The second page said I was going to give away most of my money to charities. Now, if I was going to give away most of my money, why would I do anything illegal? But the judge allowed the first page to be admitted as evidence, but not the second.

The prosecutors kept referring to benefits I got. But there was zero benefit. To get an insider trading conviction, you must have evidence that inside information was passed, there was a quid pro quo arrangement and there must have been some real benefit. They actually had nothing in terms of quid pro quo or any arrangement. They could never prove a single cent of benefit. Then they started talking of ‘future benefit’. By the time this case came, I’d already had a falling out with Rajaratnam. So the whole thing didn’t add up.


The picture the prosecution painted was that while you were very successful professionally, you weren’t as financially well off as those in your social circle. They said that was your motivation to make some easy money.

It’s complete nonsense. By any standards, I was financially very well off — and still am. My needs were way below my earning capacity. If I earned 5X, I spent 1X, because I didn’t need to spend any more. I did everything I wanted to. I didn’t have a flashy lifestyle. There is a famous shloka in Sanskrit that says if you are wearing shoes, you think the entire earth is covered in leather, which really means that if you have enough for your needs you have all the wealth in the world. This whole incident cost me a lot of money — in legal fees, fines and opportunity cost. I lost 7-8 years of my life and $60 million in legal fees, $26 million in fines. But I don’t think about it, or reflect on it very much.


How do you see (then US district attorney) Preet Bharara’s role?
Honestly, many prosecutors in the US worry about political careers. They are all about winning, not the truth. If they were about the truth they wouldn’t do what they did, which is try me at Rajaratnam’s trial. In prison, I got to learn about cases that are far worse than mine in terms of draconian sentences for doing very little or nothing. There were people who were in there who were maybe caught on the street corner selling some drugs. The prosecutors would say, ‘I am going to ask for 20 years’ jail for you but if you name two other people, I will reduce it to 5-7 years’. The person would name somebody, whether they were guilty or not. There were people in jail who had done nothing but were fingered by somebody else.


FACE TO FACE WITH RAJARATNAM

Couldn’t you have done a little more due diligence on Rajaratnam?
Well, a certain amount of revisionist history has happened on Rajaratnam. At that time, he was an extremely highly regarded trader. I checked with Hank Paulson (then Goldman Sachs CEO, who later served as the US treasury secretary) and others and they gave glowing recommendations. When I met him, I found him pretty interesting. Obviously he was very good at what he did. I wasn’t really a partner of his, it was a passive investment. I just put my money in, nothing else… In hindsight you can say this, but we were not social friends. In all those years, I may have gone to his house once, he has never been to my house. We did meet in prison, though.


What was the conversation like?
Well, he mentioned he was not in good health. I understand he goes through dialysis every other day. But on the positive side, I know that he was offered a five-year reduction in his sentence if he testified against me and he said, ‘I have nothing to say, Rajat didn’t do anything wrong’. I respected him for that, but in the end he was the reason I was there.


No one offered you a deal to reduce your sentence if you snitched?
Snitch on whom? What would I say? Honestly, I had nothing to bad to say about him (Rajaratnam). All I knew was that he had taken my money and run the fund into the ground. I had nothing to do with insider trading. It was an investment gone wrong.


ON READING GITA IN PRISON

When you were sent to prison, what went through your mind?
The shock really was when they charged me. I resigned from everything. The first time it really hit me was when I opened my calendar, and found nothing — no appointments, no scheduled meetings, which was the first time in many years. I would put on my suit but I had nowhere to go. By the time I was sentenced, I was prepared for what was coming. 


Could you recall some anecdotes from your term?
I stayed in the minimum security prison for the first eight-nine months, then two months in solitary confinement and seven months in the high security prison. The minimum security prison was rather ramshackle, with a tin roof structure and it housed 128 men in a very small space. It had steel bunks, one little cupboard and a chair to sit and you could touch all your belongings. But it had a wonderful outside environment; there was a walking track with beautiful New England landscape. I started a book club. We played a lot of games and I walked a lot. I actually still have something that I have carried from the prison, which is this little MP3 player which you can buy at the prison and you can download some songs. I have 300 songs in this, everything from old Hindi songs I grew up with to bhajans and shlokas, and my daughters would send me suggestions of songs to download. I walked 10 miles a day listening to music.

I kept myself going by saying, okay I am entering a monastery, I am going to improve myself every way I can. I became extremely fit. I used to meditate. I would try and help everybody around. I used to write letters for them.


You make it sound like a deeply spiritual experience.
Yes, it was. I had never read the Bhagvad Gita cover to cover before. But I spent almost two months in solitary confinement, and I read the Gita cover to cover at least 6 or 7 times. Now I have internalised it a lot more than I had before.


PICKING UP THE PIECES

How are you now trying to rebuild your life?
After I got out, I spent the first year mostly just learning how to live in the world again. Then I began working on the book. It was difficult writing it. I would write for a while, and then I would have to put it away because it was bringing up all the emotions. It took me two years to write it. At 70, I have no particular interest in building a business career now. I have had more than 40 years of that. Now, I would like to devote more time to family, and continue with the causes that are near and dear to my heart, which is education and health. I have probably added one more — it’s got to do with the reform of the justice system and the prison system in the US. 


What lessons did you learn from your prison time?
There were questions that I grappled with. How do you keep your dignity while you are losing your freedom? How do you maintain your self-respect? How do you maintain your identity? What do all these things mean when you are imprisoned and have very few belongings? You realise that to be happy or satisfied, you don’t need many material things. You also learn detachment.


When you look back at your rather turbulent life, is there a list of dos and don’ts you would give people?
The way I have written the book, and the way I prefer that people learn, is that they see a little bit of themselves in certain times and they learn from that. It’s more a process of learning by osmosis. It’s not like the seven habits of successful people.

Virat Kohli or Rohit Sharma, bowler's job is to execute plans: Siddarth Kaul 

","
NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad fast bowler Siddarth Kaul's bowling figures read 1/16 from three overs in the match against Kolkata Knight Riders before Andre Russell got stuck into him at the Eden Gardens on Sunday. The all-rounder picked 19 runs from the fast bowler's last over as Kaul ended with figures of 1/35 from four overs.
 

Speaking to IANS, Kaul was candid enough to accept that it was a simple case of not being able to execute the plan he had in place for Russell. But not to get deterred by the turn of events, Kaul has promised to return stronger.

""There was no dew or anything. Execution was the problem to be honest and that is why the results didn't come. But I am already working towards it and you will see the results in the next few games. You saw how (Jasprit) Bumrah was hit all over the park by (Rishabh) Pant in the game between Delhi and Mumbai.

""Sometimes you can't blame yourself as there are times when the execution just doesn't happen. But again, there are times when the ball comes out so well that nobody can hit you. It is part and parcel of the game. As a player I always look to give it my best, but there are times when the execution just doesn't happen,"" he said.

Asked if he makes special plans when bowling to stars like Virat Kohli or Rohit Sharma, Kaul said: ""We do get feedback on all the players and their areas of strengths and weaknesses. I always try to keep these things in mind and just like I said, I try to execute my plans. I always look to work on my basics and come into the game strongly without focusing too much on the opposition batsmen.""

While everyone has been talking about the No.4 slot in India's batting line-up for the World Cup, the fourth pacer's slot is also up for grabs and the fast bowler said his focus was purely on the IPL and doing well for SRH.

""If that does happen then that is a great thing as that can only act as a motivation. My job is to stay positive and keep working on the game. I also feel if I do the job and perform for my team in the IPL, the national selectors will obviously reward me. But I don't look to focus on these things and I like to focus on my game,"" he smiled.

With regular skipper Kane Williamson injured, Bhuvneshwar Kumar was elevated to the role of leading the side and Kaul said he loved the experience of playing under Bhuvi.

""He was already the leader of the bowling group and now it was fun to play under him. It always helps when a bowler is leading the team as that means you are understood even better when it comes to strategising. Had fun playing under him and I am hoping he too liked the experience of leading us,"" he said.

If Williamson missed the game due to injury, David Warner returned to the league after missing the last season due to his suspension for his involvement in the Sandpaper Gate. And Kaul said it was great to have the batsman back in the squad.

""Warner is a champion player and it feels great to have him back in the team. Whatever happened is in the past and I think he showed that he was waiting to unleash himself on the ground. Having him around always helps as his experience helps us understand situations even better,"" he said.

Jasprit Bumrah more mature, Hardik Pandya also stepping up: Rohit Sharma 

","
BENGALURU: Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma feels pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah and flamboyant all-rounder Hardik Pandya keep raising the bar for excellence with every game they play.


Mumbai edged past Royal Challengers Bangalore by six runs in their IPL clash on Thursday night and Sharma was lavish in his praise for Bumrah, who picked up three wickets, and Pandya, who scored 32 off 14 deliveries.

""I think Bumrah is more than mature now. Yes, his performance keeps growing everyday. He is a very dedicated individual and takes his game very seriously. He is quite regular with his work ethics,"" he told reporters in the post-match press conference here.


POINTS TABLE | 
SCHEDULE

Bumrah's three wickets came off 20 runs which proved cucial in restricting RCB six short of the 187 runs put up by Mumbai Indians.

Sharma said Bumrah gave a crucial breakthrough by sending back RCB captain Virat Kohli, who was going great guns along with AB De Villiers at one point of the match.

""Bumrah is very smart. We know the class of Virat and AB (De Villiers) and hence we wanted to break the partnership when they were going strong. It (De Villiers) was a crucial wicket at that point of time of the game,"" he said.

On Hardik Pandya's unbeaten knock towards the end of Mumbai innings, Sharma said those runs made the difference and such an innings was needed from him as he didn't do well in the last game against Delhi Capitals.

""...obviously there was a hunger out there to go and do well. He came out and got those crucial runs in the end. He also bowled well in the middle even though he went for few runs. It was a much improved performance from last game. He is also stepping up that ladder,"" he said.

Sharma also said Pandya's form is very important for the team.

""He (Pandya) was out for a bit and didn't play a lot of games. So, he needs time to get into the groove. He is a crucial member of the team and very flexible. His form is very important to us, which will do good for us,"" he said.

Asked about Sri Lankan pacer Lasith Malinga, Sharma said his role is to cramp batsmen by bowling bouncers and yorkers, besides taking wickets in the middle.

""He (Malinga) is the captain of Sri Lankan national team. So, obviously he wants to play the World Cup and wants to do well. He is also coming from South Africa carrying a great form. He wants to keep that form going into the world cup.

""I am sure whenever he plays here for us, he wants to do well. He knows, we expect him to come up here and deliver the goods and take wickets, bowl fast, bowl bouncers and yorkers,"" he added.

RBI: WhatsApp yet to comply with data localisation norms 

","
BENGALURU: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said that the popular messaging platform WhatsApp is not in compliance with the central bank’s data localisation norms in India. RBI’s comments come as response in an affidavit, reviewed by TOI, filed with the SC on Wednesday after the apex court made the central bank a party to a writ petition in January.


This is the first time the central bank has made an official statement on WhatsApp’s payments business and compliance with data localisation. WhatsApp, which is owned by social networking giant Facebook, has now been operating its payments business — WhatsApp Pay — in beta-mode for a year, restricted to one million users. The RBI also said it is exploring regulatory actions to expedite compliance of data localisation. However, it is being cautious to make sure a consumer’s transaction experience is not disrupted by any such measures. 




Centre for Accountability and Systemic Change, an NGO, had filed the petition challenging WhatsApp’s compliance standards and absence of a local grievance officer here. “As informed by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) on November 16, 2018 and February 5, 2019, WhatsApp is non-compliant with the RBI circular (on data localisation),” RBI’s response in the affidavit said. WhatsApp entered payments in India through Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which is run by NPCI. The original petition also challenged the Menlo Park-based company of non-payment of local taxes. 

The RBI has maintained that payments service providers and third-party payments app should follow its April 6 circular on data localisation, which mandates storage of key payments data only in India. The operative word here is — only — which payments companies had requested the RBI to omit. The RBI did not entertain the request.

Sources said WhatsApp’s newly appointed head for India — Abhijit Bose — recently met NPCI MD & CEO Dilip Asbe in Mumbai to discuss the regulatory concerns and hoping to accelerate the process of obtaining a final nod to roll out its payments service full-scale. For WhatsApp, India is its largest market with over 200 million monthly active users here. An email sent to WhatsApp India spokesperson did not elicit a response at the time of going to press. 

In October last year, WhatsApp said it built a system that stores payments-related data locally in India. NPCI, however, thought it was not enough since WhatsApp was merely mirroring or copying the payments data in India. It keeps the same in its overseas servers as well. 

Issues related to fake news and the government’s request to allow message traceability have only added to WhatsApp’s woes in India, ahead of general elections. TOI had previously reported how these non-payments issues have also emerged as a roadblock for the company’s payments operations here. To be sure, foreign payments players like Mastercard, Visa, Google and others are still in the process of complying with RBI’s data localisation guidelines. According to industry sources, these companies have given various timelines within 2019 by when they expect to be fully compliant with the norms.

Cognizant president may steer L&T’s IT services business - Times of India

","
BENGALURU: Rajeev Mehta, who will step down as the president of Cognizant on April 1, may join L&T at a time when the latter has mounted an unsolicited bid to acquire Mindtree, people directly aware of the matter said.


Mehta will serve as an adviser to Cognizant's new CEO Brian Humphries till May 1, announced earlier as part of his exit plan.

Mehta is expected to help the $18-billion construction and engineering conglomerate to chart aggressive growth for IT services units - L&T Infotech, L&T Technology Services, and Mindtree, if the acquisition bid is successful. He is likely to spearhead the combined operations when L&T merges these units eventually, sources said.

Mehta emerged as the top contender after L&T undertook an exhaustive leadership mapping exercise to identify the new face to steer the business, they added. Calls and emails to Mehta remained unanswered at the time of going to press. Queries to L&T didn't elicit any response.

A two-decade-old Cognizant veteran, Mehta was a key figure in former CEO Francisco D'souza's core team which scripted the 2020 strategy. He joined the company when it was barely $25 million and was part of the long growth rally to $16 billion last year. Mehta was appointed as president of the company in 2016 replacing his predecessor Gordon Coburn who resigned from the firm after Cognizant disclosed violations to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

Phil Fersht, CEO of US-based HFS Research, said, ""Mehta has lived the whole Cognizant growth story over many years and was widely tipped to take over from D'Souza when he stepped aside. He was known internally as ""Frank's right-hand bulldog"" -- a toughie, an enforcer, a doer. He has proven operational leadership capability (essential for what LTI/Mindtree needs) and is used tackling the shift from $2 billion to over $10 billion,"" he said.

Ten days ago, L&T acquired the largest shareholder V G Siddhartha's 20% stake in Mindtree, pitting the four founders in a public fight against the former. L&T has also placed an order with brokers to pick up another 15% of the company shares from the market. In addition, it has announced an open offer for 31% of shares. If successful, the cumulative deal for 66% stake will cost L&T nearly Rs 11,000 crore, or $1.6 billion.

Mehta, who nursed CEO ambitions, was given a substantial increase in his compensation last year, and it was expected he would stay in the company. He got a cash bonus of $1.3 million and restricted stock units of $9 million. In 2017, Mehta's target cash incentive was $535,000 which was double of what its former CEO Francisco D'Souza received that year.

Fersht argued that Mehta would be a terrific choice to lead the merged entity because of his terrific connections, experience and the dedication to ram those two together. ""With the mid-caps like Mphasis, Virtusa, Genpact all doing well, there is clear evidence that this merger could be successful, but needs very strong leadership. Raj Mehta must be geared up for a situation he is tailor-made for!"" he added.

RCB vs MI: Jasprit Bumrah chokes RCB at death as Mumbai Indians win by 6 runs 

","
BENGALURU: The vociferous crowd at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium was still celebrating home skipper Virat Kohli's personal milestone of 5,000 runs - the second by a player after Suresh Raina - when Jasprit Bumrah (3/20), unleashed a short ball which Kohli (46, 32b, 6x4), who hadn't scored a boundary in 10 balls, tried to pull.
 


 IPL Schedule| IPL Points Table | Scorecard
The delivery took flight but didn't go the distance and was pouched by Hardik Pandya at midwicket. The contest between arguably the finest pacer and batsman was won by the former.



Chasing 188 for victory was always going to be a daunting task and Royal Challengers Bangalore needed 72 off 28 balls when the skipper departed. But Mumbai had AB de Villers (70 no, 41b, 4x4, 6x6) to contend with. Up stepped ABD slamming Lasith Malinga for 20 runs in the 16th over and the 18th over from Hardik Pandya yielded 18 runs, but Bumrah still turned the match on its head.

It's not for nothing that the wily pacer is one of the most feared death-over specialist. In the 17th over he accounted for Shimron Hetmyer and conceded a single run and in the penultimate over he sent back a struggling Colin de Grandhomme while giving away only five runs.

Needing 17 runs off the last over, de Villiers slammed Malinga over the ropes off the first ball, but the Sri Lankan, who joined the team only on Wednesday night, weighed in with his experience and Mumbai won by six runs with the hosts finishing with 181/5.



Earlier, RCB bowlers and MI batsmen oscillated between being good and ordinary. A case in point was the 14th over of Mumbai's innings in which leggie Yuzvendra Chahal (4/38) conceded 20 runs which saw Yuvraj Singh cart him for three consecutive maximums before being dismissed off the fourth delivery. On the other hand, pacer Umesh Yadav, bowling the 17th over, was measly giving away only two runs and claimed a wicket.

Even as the home side seemed like they were in control of the death overs, the big-hitting Hardik flexed his muscles with an unbeaten 14-ball 32 (2x4, 3x6) to take the visiting side to a competitive 187/8. Forty runs came off the last 17 balls.

Put into bat by the home team skipper Virat Kohli, the visitors were off to a good start provided by Rohit Sharma (48, 33b, 8x4, 1x6) with his fellow opener Quinton de Kock (23, 20, 3x4, 1x6) a tad slow off the blocks. On a wicket which offered the bowlers early pace, Rohit was quick to react. He made his intent clear as he struck consecutive boundaries off Umesh Yadav's bowling and added a couple more off Navdeep Saina in the flowing over as Mumbai piled 52 runs in powerplay. De Kock survived on 16 as Colin de Grandhomme put him down at midwicket off Saini's bowling. But the South African didn't make much of the lifeline.

Introduced in the seventh over, Chahal struck immediately, with de Kock losing his stumps as he tried to reverse sweep a googly.

Suryakumar Yadav (38, 24b, 4x4, 1x6) then decided to go after the bowlers in the company of Yuvraj Singh. After Yuvraj, Chahal, who got crucial wickets despite going for runs, sent back Yadav.

The hosts decided to go with an unchanged squad, while Mumbai brought in Lasith Malinga and Mayank Markande in place of Ben Cutting and Rasikh Khan.

Jet Airways News: Planes grounded, Jet Airways sends expat pilots on leave without pay 

","
NEW DELHI: 

  Jet Airways
 + has started sending its pilots - most likely only the expats - on furloughs, or leaves without pay. Expat pilots cost nearly twice as much as their Indian counterparts as they have to be given accommodation and flight tickets to their home country every few weeks. Since Jet is now operating 35 of its once-upon-a-time fleet of 124 planes, the lender-led management has begun cutting this extra cost. The airline is trying to take this number to 75 by April 26, still leaving it pilot surplus.


Sources say only expat pilots are being sent on furlough. Despite repeated attempts, Jet did not comment on how many expats it has and if the offer is being made to them only. 



With just one-fourth of operational fleet, Jet suspends services to 13 international routes till end-AprilJet Airways has suspended operations on 13 more international routes till end-April and grounded seven more planes due to non-payment of rentals, taking the number of such aircraft to 54. The airline has also reduced frequencies on seven other overseas routes, mostly from Delhi and Mumbai. From 600 daily flights operations reduced to one-fourth.


""Due to the reduced network and fleet plan, the company's pilot requirements on your fleet have reduced and your services will not be required… as an interim arrangement, we are offering furlough to pilots. Accordingly, we hereby offer you furlough of your employment with effect from April 01, 2019 till further notice,"" a letter issued to an expat pilot of Boeing 737 on Thursday said.

""Please consider this letter as notice to furlough your employment with us. We will periodically assess pilot requirements and advise you accordingly,"" it adds. During the furlough, pilots will not not receive salary, any other monetary benefit, accommodation and medical insurance. 

""However, you will continue to be eligible for free passages as per the prevailing staff travel policy of the company. You shall maintain recency / validity of your licenses / medical during the period of furlough. In case your employment contract ceases during the term of this furlough arrangement, the furlough arrangement contemplated herein shall automatically come to an end on the date of cessation of the employment contract,"" the letter says.

In the last two months, Jet has seen several of its pilots leave. They along with aircraft engineers and senior management are awaiting payment of last three to four months' salaries. 

Expat pilots have always been a touchy issue in almost all Indian carriers. Last August when Jet had proposed 15 per cent pay cut for pilots, the airline had even then issued ad to hire expats. When Indian pilots questioned the move of cutting their salaries yet continuing to hire expats, the then management had said salary of expat pilots would also be deducted. The salary deduction move did not happen and the airline later was not in a position to pay salaries to the level of employees with big pay packages.

DRDO: Target destroyed by India's ASAT missile was an out of service Indian satellite 

","
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the nation on Wednesday at 12:10pm announcing that India has entered an elite space club by successfully testing A-SAT, an anti-satellite missile. India is now an entrant in a club of three nations — United States, Russia and China — with anti-satellite weapon capabilities, informed Prime Minister Modi.

Government sources revealed to ANI that the A-SAT weapon was launched around 11:16am on Wednesday and targeted an Indian satellite which had been decommissioned and was orbiting on a 'Low Earth Orbit' at a height of 300km from the earth's surface. The entire test, with confirmation of target elimination, took 3 minutes.



India successfully shoots down satellite in space: PM ModiIndia on Wednesday destroyed a low-orbiting satellite in a missile test that puts the country in the space ""super league"", PM Narendra Modi said in an address to the nation. ""A while ago our scientists shot down a live satellite at a low-earth orbit,"" PM Modi said in a televised address to the nation. ""This is a proud moment for India,"" he added.

The project announced by Prime Minister Modi in a televised address as ""Mission Shakti"" was coordinated by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) Chairman G. Satheesh Reddy and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval along with officers of the National Security Council.


India's A-SAT not against any country: PM Modi

The missile was launched from the DRDO's testing range in Odisha's Balasore. At the time of testing of the A-SAT missile, G. Satheesh Reddy was camping in Balasore to see the project through.



'Mission Shakti' and ASAT missile test: All you need to knowPrime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Wednesday that India successfully targeted a live satellite on low earth orbit. The missile test has put India in the space ""super league"". 

""A-SAT missile will give new strength to India's space programme. I assure the international community that our capability won't be used against anyone but is purely India's defence initiative for its security,"" assured Prime Minister Modi in his televised address. Government sources also assured that this test would have no bearing on India's status in the MTCR (Missile Technology Control Regime) or other such treaties.


'Mission Shakti': India's first anti-satellite missile system that destroyed a LEO satelliteLow earth orbit or LEO satellites are used for telecommunication that orbit till a distance of around 2,000 kilometers above the earth's surface. These satellites are also used for data communication for instance e-mail, video conferencing, etc. These satellites move at extremely high speeds and are not fixed in space in relation to the earth.

""'Mission Shakti' is an important step towards securing India's safety, economic growth and technological advancement,"" said Prime Minister Modi.

Nirav Modi possibly owns two flats, not one, in London skyscraper - Times of India

","
LONDON: Wanted diamantaire Nirav Modi will be making his second court appearance in London on Friday when his lawyers are expected to make a second bail application for him.


The 48-year-old has been languishing in 

  one of Britain's most overcrowded prisons
 + - Wandsworth prison - since March 20 when he was remanded in custody after his first bail application was rejected by district judge Marie Mallon despite offering £500,000 as security and offering to report regularly at his local police station.



Nirav Modi's art collection fetches Rs 54 crore55 rare oil paintings by some of India’s finest artists like—V S Gaitonde, Raja Ravi Varma, F N Souza, K K Hebbar, Jogen Chowdhury, Akbar Padamsee, Arpana Caur—seized from fugitive jeweller Nirav Modi’s collection by tax authorities went under the hammer on Tuesday and fetched Rs 54 cr. Leading the sales was an untitled oil on canvas by Gaitonde that sold for Rs 22 cr.


On Friday Nirav, who is accused by the government of India of being involved in the fraudulent issuing of letters of undertaking (LoUs) in respect of Punjab National Bank worth £1.2 billion, will face a different judge at Westminster magistrates' court - the chief magistrate, Emma Arbuthnot, who oversaw the extradition trial of Vijay Mallya.

He will arrive in a prison van and appear in the dock. His barrister is expected to increase his bail security offer. The CBI and ED have flown over to attend the hearing and meet the UK legal team representing the government of India in the case.

Nirav is using the same solicitor as Mallya - Anand Doobay. Doobay's company, Boutique Law, boasts on its website: ""We have substantial experience acting for clients facing money laundering investigations and prosecutions. Our extensive experience of defending allegations of corruption and bribery involves cases both in the UK and overseas. We can also assist with applying to Interpol for access to information or for information including red notices to be amended or deleted.""

TOI can also reveal that Nirav owns not one but two £8 million flats in the 82-apartment skyscraper Centre Point where he lives. Both were paid for in cash.

Nirav has been living in the 2,133-sq-ft three-bedroom luxury apartment 42 on the 29th floor of Centre Point tower in central London since January 2018. The title deeds, which TOI has possession of, show that apartment 42, which is the address he gave in court, that is also linked to Diamond Holdings, was sold to a ""Richard Beattie"" on January 5, 2018 for £7,950,000 in cash. The same date, flat 5, also on the 29th floor, was also sold to Richard Beattie in cash for the same price. Both are registered as care of a London law firm that provides advice to wealthy individuals.

A well-placed source told TOI: ""I think the safe thing to assume is that Nirav Modi is Richard Beattie. Both flats have Nirav Modi's footprints all over them. He has probably asked someone like his butler or an accountant to put their name on the title deeds so he cannot be traced.""

The spokeswoman for the said law firm said: ""We are not able to comment on this.""

TOI also tracked down the London office of Diamond Holdings, the jewellery business that Nirav started on May 24, 2018, which is registered at the Harrow address of his accountants. The actual office though is situated in a secluded spot on the upper floors of a Georgian townhouse in Soho Square, which also houses 20th Century Fox, close to the Radha-Krishna Temple and the restaurant Govinda's. The white blinds were pulled down completely on the middle to upper floors when TOI visited as Krishna devotees were singing and dancing close by. There is no signage to Diamond Holdings on the exterior of the building. A company that lets out office space runs the building and lets out sections of it. Office spaces are let for a minimum of £3,850 per month with seven desks to £19,500 per month for 30 desks on minimum 12-month leases, TOI discovered.

The receptionist on the ground floor confirmed Diamond Holdings was in an office upstairs but said no one was allowed in to see them without prior appointment. ""We manage office spaces and they have let some. I have been told not to let anyone up there unless they have an appointment,"" he said.

When asked if Diamond Holdings was the only office there, he said, ""No, we have others,"" but gave the impression there was a team of staff working for Diamond Holdings.

""The secretary of Diamond Holdings has already gone home and she asked me not to let anyone in without an appointment. I don't know what they do or how long they have been here. I don't have any telephone number I can give you,"" he said.

A school course to cultivate human values 

","
NEW DELHI: Dalai Lama Trust, Emory University (USA) and Vana Foundation will launch on April 4 SEE Learning (Social, Emotional and Ethical Learning) — the culmination of more than two decades of educational collaboration between the Dalai Lama and Emory University, Atlanta.


This event, which will be on till April 6 in Delhi, will be presided over by Nobel Peace laureate the Dalai Lama and will include Kailash Satyarthi, another Nobel Peace laureate, and globally-recognised experts in social and emotional learning such as Daniel Goleman, Kimberly Schonert-Reichl and Robert Roeser.

The curricula, which will be internationally accessible, will be translated in 14 languages, including Hindi, English, French, Russian, German and Chinese. It has four modules covering early elementary grades to high school.

SEE Learning is a new education programme developed at Emory University in Atlanta, USA with the help of experts in developmental psychology, education and neuroscience, as well as with the vision and support of the Dalai Lama. The programme is a comprehensive framework for the cultivation of social, emotional and ethical competencies as well as age-specific curricula for K-12 schools and a programme support structure for educator preparation and development. 

In his foreword to SEE Learning Companion, the Dalai Lama has said “to involve the whole of humanity, we need an ethical approach with universal appeal, a secular ethics that nurtures such basic human values as empathy, tolerance, forgiveness and love”. 

Recent research has shown that such values can be cultivated through learning and practice on the basis of common sense, experience and scientific findings, he added. “They can be integrated in heart and mind not through the enforcement of rules, but through the voluntary application of reason and investigation.”

With the vision of “a compassionate and ethical world for all”, SEE Learning is the first social and emotional learning programme to explicitly focus on the cultivation of compassion, other basic human values and “ethical intelligence”, provide developmentally appropriate methods for attention training, include “system thinking” at all levels of education and incorporate a resilience and trauma-informed approach.

Trump, Moon to meet in Washington in April: Seoul - Times of India

","
SEOUL: US President Donald Trump will host his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in next month, Seoul said Friday, after the latest summit between Washington and Pyongyang ended in deadlock.

Moon has long backed a policy of engagement with nuclear-armed, sanctions-hit Pyongyang and was instrumental in brokering talks between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. But the failure of Kim and Trump to reach an agreement in Hanoi on curtailing Pyongyang's nuclear programme in exchange for relaxation of sanctions has raised questions over the future of the process.

Moon will visit Washington for two days from April 10, an official from the South's presidential Blue House told AFP.

""The two leaders will have in-depth talks... to coordinate their stance on setting up a peace regime on the Korean peninsula through complete denuclearisation,"" Yoon Do-han, the senior presidential press secretary said Friday.

Earlier this month, Pyongyang abruptly pulled its staff out of an inter-Korean liaison office, but the officials came back to the joint facility in the Northern city of Kaesong days later.

Their return came after Trump announced he had ""ordered"" the withdrawal of additional sanctions — without identifying the measures — against Pyongyang by the US Treasury.

Helmet saves the life of online food delivery boy 

","
PUNE: A 25-year-old youth working as a delivery executive for online food aggregator Swiggy had a narrow escape after he met with an accident on Boat Club Road. 


Akhay Vasant Polke was hit by a speeding bike at on Boat Club Road 4.30pm on March 21 and smashed his head on the road. He did not suffer any head injuries as he was wearing a helmet. However, Polke fractured his leg in the accident. He registered a complaint against the bike rider at the Koregaon Park police station on Sunday.



“I delivered food to a customer’s home in Koregaon Park and from there, I was heading back home to Tadiwala Road for a lunch break,” Polke, who is recuperating in a private hospital, told TOI. “I was riding on Boat Club Road at a moderate speed, when I suddenly noticed a bike coming at a high speed from the opposite direction. The rider lost control over the vehicle — his hands were shaking when he spotted me. I tried to move my bike to the left side of the road, but before I could do so, the bike rammed my right leg,” he said. 

Polke fell to his right and smashed his head on the road. “My helmet came loose and was rolling down the road. It saved my life as it prevented me from receiving multiple injuries on my head,” he added.

“My leg was seriously injured. Passers-by rushed me to a nearby private hospital in an autorickshaw. They also rushed the bike rider to the hospital, but he was discharged soon as he only suffered minor injuries,” Polke said. 

According to passers-by, the other biker was riding in an inebriated condition. 

“The orthopaedic surgeonbs have operated on my leg. Two more surgeries will need be performed in the coming days,” Polke said. “I won’t be able to walk for six months,” he added.

The 25-year-old is the sole breadwinner of his family. He had joined Swiggy as a delivery executive six months ago. “My job is to deliver packets of food to customers in the Koregaon Park and Dhole Patil Road areas,” he said. 

According to Polke, Swiggy puts its employees through a rigorous training regiment. “We must compulsorily wear helmets and abide by traffic rules, otherwise we will be fined,” Polke said. 

The company’s mediclaim insurance will cover Polke’s expenses to the tune of Rs1.5 lakh. “I will appeal to the other biker to foot the rest of the bill, as the accident occurred due to his negligence,” Polke added.

“We have seized the other rider’s bike, but we have not questioned him as he was discharged from the hospital. We will issue a notice to him and ask him to cooperate in the investigation. We are also checking CCTV cameras in the area. A chargesheet will be filed on the completion of the probe,” sub-inspector Bhagwat Shendge of the Koregaon Park police said.

MI vs RCB 2019: Umpires should keep their eyes open, this is not club cricket, says Virat Kohli; Rohit Sharma agrees 

","
BANGALORE: An angry Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Virat Kohli came down heavily on ICC Elite Panel Umpire S Ravi after the final delivery of the match bowled by Mumbai Indians' Lasith Malinga turned out to be a 'no-ball', which was not awarded to the losing team.


More importantly, winning captain Rohit Sharma was also critical of umpiring standard during the match.


POINTS TABLE | 
SCHEDULE

""We are playing at the IPL level. It's not club level, the umpires should have their eyes open. That was a big no-ball. That is a ridiculous call (last ball). If it is a game of margins, I don't know what is happening. They should have been more sharp and careful out there,"" a livid Kohli said at the post-match presentation ceremony.

Incidentally, Ravi is the only Indian umpire in ICC's Elite Panel for a number of years now as none of the others have been good enough to be elevated.

Needing 7 to win and six to take it to Super Over, Malinga's full toss yielded only one run but the big screen replay showed that the bowler had overstepped and a free hit should have been awarded.

Had it been a free-hit, AB de Villiers batting on 70 would have faced with five needed to win.

""We should have done a better job with the ball after they were seven down. The last few overs were brutal for us. Bit of a mistake from me to take Bumrah on at that time. Bumrah makes a hell of a difference in any team,"" the RCB skipper praised his India teammate.

Winning captain Rohit also voiced his concerns about umpiring.

""Honestly, I just go to know after crossing the rope that it was a no-ball. These kind of mistakes aren't good for the game. The over before that Bumrah bowled, a ball which wasn't a wide but it was called,"" Rohit referred to a decision given by other umpire C Nandan.

""Anything over 180 you can fight with. It wasn't a safe score but we had the bowlers to get the job done. Even though Virat and AB had a partnership going, we didn't panic. I thought we stuck to our plans, it was a great effort by the bowlers. Should have got 200 with the bat on this pitch.""

Mumbai youth lands Rs 1.2 crore job at Google's London office 

","
MUMBAI: Abdullah Khan (21) may have failed to crack the entrance for IITs, but he has bagged an offer that many IITians would envy. Early this week, Khan landed a job at Google's London office, for a package of Rs 1.2 crore. The average salary offered to a graduate from a non-IIT engineering college in the city is around Rs 4 lakh pa.


Khan, a student of Shree LR Tiwari Engineering College, Mira Road, was called for an interview by Google on the basis of a profile on a site that hosts competitive programming challenges.

After a few online interviews, Khan was asked to appear for the final screening at Google's office in London early this month.

His six-figure package includes the base salary of Rs 54.5 lakh (£60,000) per annum, 15 per cent bonus and stock options worth Rs 58.9 lakh ($85,000) over four years. Khan, who is doing his final year BE (computer science), will join Google's site reliability engineering team in September.

An email from a Google official in November last year mentioned that they had seen Khan's profile on the programming site, and said they were looking for people for locations across Europe.

Khan told TOI he was not expecting such an offer when he participated in competitions on that site. ""I used to participate as it was fun. I did not even know that firms check programmers' profiles on such sites. I showed the email to my friend who knew someone who had received such an email in the past. I am looking forward to joining their team. It will be an amazing learning experience for me,"" said Khan. The coding junkie did his schooling in Saudi Arabia and moved to Mumbai only after Class XII.

SRH vs RR Preview: Sunrisers Hyderabad out to tame Rajasthan Royals 

","
HYDERABAD: Out 'muscled' by a Jamaican who goes by the name of Andre Russell, Sunrisers Hyderabad will look to make amends against a side which is reeling under the 'Mankad' effect. Like the Sunrisers, Rajasthan Royals too were cruising towards victory when a 'game-changer' act by Kings XI Punjab skipper R Ashwin turned the match on its head. The off-spinner 'ran out' Jos Buttler and the Royals caved in meekly thereafter. Smarting under the 'unlikely' losses, both teams are keen to regroup quickly and get their campaign off the ground as they lock horns at the RGIC Stadium, here on Friday night.



IPL Schedule | 
IPL Points Table

The hosts have much to cheer about as their top three batsmen were among the runs in Kolkata. As a duck takes to the water, opener David Warner seamlessly blended himself with the team. The one-year 'forced' break seems to have had no effect on the pocket dynamite. In fact, Warner looked hungry and keen on showing what the fans had missed last season. On way to a 53-ball 85, the Australian had become the first batsman in IPL to post 40 fifty plus innings (3 hundreds and 37 fifties) but to his chagrin Russell stole the thunder. 



With Jonny Bairstow and Vijay Shankar getting runs under the belt and Yusuf Pathan and Manish Pandey in the ranks, the Sunrisers look a much improved batting side. However, the Sunrisers will have to contend against Jofra Archer. The Barbardian born bowler, who is eligible to play for England and is likely to be in their World Cup squad, not only generates genuine pace but is also a very crafty one. Against the explosive Kings XI, Archer conceded just 17 runs in his four overs. The others to watch out for will be Dhawal Kulkarni and K Gowtham.

The hosts' concern will be the bowling which was taken part by Russell on Sunday. Barring leggie Rashid Khan, none of the others could make much of an impact and that is something the hosts will have to address. The Sunrisers, over the years, have taken pride in their bowling attack. They have mastered the art of defending small totals and hence being torn to shreds in the opening game is some food for thought for the team management.



The Sunrisers' bowlers will undergo another acid test as the Royals too boost of an aggressive batting line-up. Buttler, on Monday, showed what kind of damage he is capable of inflicting on the opposition. 



Skipper Ajinkya Rahane is a 'man on a mission' as he is keen on proving his critics wrong. Sanju Samson, Steve Smith and the big-hitting Ben Stokes give the Royals a formidable look. The dangerman will be Smith as the Australian has the uncanny ability to rotate the strike and also go for the big hits when needed. But the way they lost six wickets for just 20 runs at the death against Kings XI is something which they need to look into on an urgent basis as the Sunrisers' bowlers will be eagerly waiting to exploit the chinks in the Royals armour.

Self-driving cars learn to navigate unknown, extreme conditions - Times of India

","
BOSTON: Stanford scientists have developed a way for self-driving cars that to learn from previous experiences, helping the autonomous vehicles perform more safely in extreme and unknown circumstances.


The researchers tested the technology on a racetrack using two self-driving cars Niki and Shelley.

The system performed about as well as an existing autonomous control system and an experienced racecar driver, they said.

""Our work is motivated by safety, and we want autonomous vehicles to work in many scenarios, from normal driving on high-friction asphalt to fast, low-friction driving in ice and snow,"" said Nathan Spielberg, a graduate student at Stanford University in the US.

""We want our algorithms to be as good as the best skilled drivers -- and, hopefully, better,"" said Spielberg.

While current autonomous cars might rely on in-the-moment evaluations of their environment, the control system these researchers designed incorporates data from recent maneuvers and past driving experiences -- including trips Niki took around an icy test track near the Arctic Circle.

Its ability to learn from the past could prove particularly powerful, given the abundance of autonomous car data researchers are producing in the process of developing these vehicles.

Control systems for autonomous cars need access to information about the available road-tire friction. This information dictates the limits of how hard the car can brake, accelerate and steer in order to stay on the road in critical emergency scenarios.

If engineers want to safely push an autonomous car to its limits, such as having it plan an emergency manoeuvre on ice, they have to provide it with details, like the road-tire friction, in advance. This is difficult in the real world where friction is variable and often is difficult to predict.

To develop a more flexible, responsive control system, the researchers built a neural network -- a type of artificially intelligent computing system -- that integrates data from past driving experiences, and a winter test facility with foundational knowledge provided by 200,000 physics-based trajectories.

""With the techniques available today, you often have to choose between data-driven methods and approaches grounded in fundamental physics,"" said J Christian Gerdes, a professor at Stanford.

""We think the path forward is to blend these approaches in order to harness their individual strengths. Physics can provide insight into structuring and validating neural network models that, in turn, can leverage massive amounts of data,"" said Gerdes.

The group ran comparison tests for their new system. Shelley sped around controlled by the physics-based autonomous system, pre-loaded with set information about the course and conditions.

When compared on the same course during 10 consecutive trials, Shelley and a skilled amateur driver generated comparable lap times.

Researchers loaded Niki with their new neural network system. The car performed similarly running both the learned and physics-based systems, even though the neural network lacked explicit information about road friction.

In simulated tests, the neural network system outperformed the physics-based system in both high-friction and low-friction scenarios. It did particularly well in scenarios that mixed those two conditions.

The results were encouraging, but the researchers stress that their neural network system does not perform well in conditions outside the ones it has experienced.

They say as autonomous cars generate additional data to train their network, the cars should be able to handle a wider range of conditions

NEET UG 2019 Exam: How to attempt Question Paper? - Times of India

","
NEET is an entrance test for the candidates who wish to be a Graduate in a medical or dental course such as MBBS/BDS. This year the NEET 2019 exam is scheduled on May 5, 2019. Candidates who will be appearing for the NEET exam for the first time should know how to attempt the question paper smartly in order to attempt a maximum number of questions and score more marks in the examination.


Here we have shared some strategy on how you should attempt the NEET question paper with proper time utilisation to turn out your knowledge into marks. With an effective study plan, it becomes easy to ace the exam.






NEET 2019 Exam Pattern

NEET is an offline objective test, conducted to judge your aptitude to become a doctor. It is a single level exam which includes 3 different subjects (Physics, Chemistry and Biology (Botany + Zoology)) for a total of 720 marks. 45 questions are asked from each section whereas from Biology 90 questions are asked to be answered within 3 hours. Now, let’s take a look at the strategy for NEET UG 2019 Exam.






Strategy for NEET 2019 Exam
* Out of 180 questions attempt all the doable questions first, which you have practiced before.

* If you have practiced well, then you can roughly attempt 120 questions with accuracy. It can easily get you within the merit list.

* Skip the questions where you feel difficulty, in order to save time and attempt the maximum number of questions.

* 2 hrs 30 minutes is enough to complete the paper. Hence, keep the last 30 minutes to attempt the left out questions.

* In these last minutes, you can also do guesswork but only if you are confused between two options. Since guesswork may lead to negative marking.

* Remain calm and do not panic, as panic may lead to stress which may disturb your time management.

* Devote time smartly in order to secure the cut off marks and make it to the merit list. 


Order of Attempt for NEET 2019 Exam
We would suggest you to pick the easiest section in order to secure time. Mainly students consider Biology as the simplest subject due to conceptual based questions. Under this subject, you can attempt a maximum number of questions within less period of time with more accuracy.

Secondly, you can switch to the Chemistry section. This subject involves both conceptual based as well as numerical based questions. If you are familiar with the formulas and concepts, then it would be easy for you to attempt more than 50% questions within 55 minutes.

Physics is generally considered as one of the difficult subjects in NEET exam. This section is lengthy and also time-consuming subject due to which it is considered toughest among all. Thus, attempt this section at last to avoid indulging with the numerical and wasting time to find accuracy.

As we know, the preparation strategy differs from student to student. Hence, you can go through these strategies for a reference and can also adjust it accordingly to prepare for NEET 2019 exam.

Lok Sabha elections: Key to Delhi could lie in eastern UP 

","
LUCKNOW: Eastern UP, the region that will play a key role in the numbers game for the next Lok Sabha, will see a triangular contest as Yogi Adityanath, Akhilesh Yadav and Priyanka Gandhi slug it out.


For Akhilesh, who is contesting from Azamgarh, it's a maiden foray into the region, which accounts for 35 Lok Sabha seats. BJP dominated the region in both the 2014 Lok Sabha election and the 2017 assembly polls. In 2014, it won 32 of the 35 Lok Sabha seats here.

Akhilesh's father and SP founder Mulayam Singh Yadav had won Azamgarh by 60,000 votes against BJP's Ramakant Yadav in 2014, when BJP had swept the region riding the Modi wave. BJP is yet to announce its nominee, but speculation is rife that Bhojpuri film star Dinesh Lal Yadav aka Nirahua, who joined BJP on Thursday, may take on the SP chief.

Azamgarh has a large Yadav and Muslim population, so the caste arithmetic favours Akhilesh. Nirahua is from neighbouring Ghazipur and BJP hopes to exploit his star power among Bhojpuri speaking population.

Eastern UP comprises the most densely populated areas and has been historically crippled by poverty and backwardness. Human development indicators of the region have been worse than even drought-prone Bundelkhand.

Out of 21 CMs since Independence, including Yogi, nine belonged to this region, yet it lags in employment, industrial development, infrastructure, investment and agriculture. Under Yogi, state machinery has shifted focus to the eastern region but it is yet to show tangible impact.


 After the decline of Congress in the late 1980s, BJP gradually captured eastern UP, drawing strength from the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and three seats of religious power - Ram temple in Ayodhya, Gorakhnath temple in Gorakhpur, which is Yogi's home ground, and Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi. But the rise of SP and BSP after their 1993 alliance dealt a blow to saffron power.

The regional allies dominated the region for more than a decade when BJP was reduced to 10 seats in the 2004 and 2009 Lok Sabha polls. However, in 2014, BJP turned the caste mathematics upside down, winning a large chunk of OBCs from SP and non-Jatav Dalits from BSP.

The onus, therefore, is on Akhilesh to revive the alliance. By tying up with BSP and snatching away Yogi's bastion Gorakhpur in a bypoll, he showed it's possible. In eastern UP, he has entered alliances with smaller outfits, such as Nirbal Indian Shoshit Hamara Aam Dal (Nishad) Party. The latter comprises primarily Mallahs (boatmen community), who wield considerable influence in Gorakhpur, Bhadohi and neighbouring areas. In the Gorakhpur bypoll, SP loaned its candidate from Nishad - Praveen Nishad, who won. He is likely to be re-nominated.

BJP is banking on Modi and Yogi and their development plank in Varanasi and Gorakhpur. Since 2014, Modi has rolled out development projects to the tune of Rs 2 lakh crore in Varanasi. Yogi, after becoming CM, has followed Modi's development model in Gorakhpur.

Congress has had a late start. After its attempts to join the grand alliance failed, Rahul Gandhi deployed his sister Priyanka with the objective of reviving the party in east UP. Her Ganga yatra from Allahabad to Varanasihas enthused the cadre and filled a leadership vacuum. But the Congress vote can cut both ways. If it win over Muslims, it will dent SP-BSP. If upper castes gravitate towards it, BJP will be in trouble.

Income tax: Direct tax collection falls short, CBDT raises alarm 

","
NEW DELHI: The CBDT has rung alarm bells and has asked the Income Tax (I-T) department to go for a major assault as the direct tax collection target remains short of about 15 per cent, with the financial year closing less than a week away.


On March 26, CBDT member (revenue) Neena Kumar shot off a letter to all the regional chiefs of the department stating that the tax collection figures have ""been reviewed and it is seen that as against the budget collection target of Rs 12,00,000 crore, only 85.1 per cent of the target at Rs 10,21,251 crore has been collected as on March 23.""

The officer, who is responsible to supervise I-T department's tax collection work across the country, underlined the areas that are sluggish vis-a-vis direct tax collections obtained from personal, corporate and advance tax categories.

""The minor head-wise analysis indicates worsening trend of negative growth in regular collections at -6.9 per cent as against -5.2 per cent in the last week. This is an alarming situation which needs immediate attention,"" Kumar wrote in the letter.

The officer expressed CBDT's disappointment at this situation and has asked the supervisory tax officials to pull up their socks and ensure no stone remains unturned to achieve the target.

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) frames policy for the I-T department and is also its controlling authority that functions from the North Block in the finance ministry.

""You are aware that regular assessment tax is bench-mark of performance as it is based upon quality of demand raised which can further be converted into actual collections,"" Kumar wrote in the letter.

""Board (the CBDT) has discussed strategies through various communications with you (senior officials) and it was expected that by this time your strategies would have succeeded resulting into improved collections. However, the figures of collection give a different account,"" she added.

She asked the department to take ""all possible actions urgently, especially with respect to recovery of arrear and current demand, so as to achieve the targets for collection.""

The CBDT has been worried over the direct tax collection work for quite some time and board chairman P C Mody had recently held a video-conference with the top brass of the department across the country and discussed strategies to boost the collection figures to be achieved by the end of the 2018-19 fiscal on March 31.

Both Mody and Kumar are undertaking daily updates on the issue. They are monitoring advance tax and arrear collections, enforcement action to check tax evasion and subsequent surrender of undisclosed income, a senior official said.

IIT-Delhi researchers develop AI-based detector for malaria, TB, cervical cancer - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi have developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based low-power electronic hardware system that can help in detecting malaria, tuberculosis, intestinal parasite and cervical cancer in a few milliseconds.


The research focuses on building a neuromorphic system which can be used for healthcare access in resource-constrained areas with limited access to human specialists.

""While several software AI models exist for healthcare and diagnostic related applications, need of the hour is to efficiently map these models on portable dedicated low-power, low-cost hardware to enable edge-AI systems accessible to all in low resource environment,"" said Professor Manan Suri, Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Delhi.

Suri, who is leading the team of researchers, said microscopy is particularly well adapted to low-resource, high disease burden areas, being both simple and versatile; even for diagnostic tasks. While newer technologies are available for diagnosis, the cost of specialised equipment may render it impractical in such places, he said.

""In contrast to alternatives such as rapid diagnostic tests, however, microscopy-based diagnosis does depend on the availability of skilled technicians, of which there is a critical shortage. As a result, diagnoses are often made on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms alone, which is error-prone and leads to higher mortality, drug resistance, and the economic burden of buying unnecessary drugs,"" the professor said.

""There is therefore need for alternatives which can help in providing the access to quality diagnosis that is currently routinely unavailable,"" he added.

CBSE to introduce artificial intelligence, yoga as new subjects - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: The CBSE will introduce artificial intelligence (AI), early childhood care education and yoga as new subjects in school curriculum from the upcoming academic session, an official said.


A decision to introduce the three subjects was taken at a recent meeting of the board's governing body, he said.

""The CBSE is introducing artificial intelligence as an optional 6th subject at Class IX from the session 2019-2020 onwards. To enhance the multidisciplinary approach in teaching learning and also to sensitise the new generation, it was decided that schools may start AI ""inspire module"" of 12 hours at Class VIII itself,"" the senior board official said.





 He said the board has also decided to introduce yoga and early childhood education as elective subjects at senior secondary level.

""The decision was taken considering the demand of schools supplemented by various reports that projected the huge requirement of yoga professionals and early childhood educators,"" the official said.

As per norms, a skill subject, at secondary level, may be offered as additional sixth subject along with the existing five compulsory subjects.

And if a student fails in any one of the three elective subjects (science, mathematics and social science), then it will be replaced by the skill subject (offered as a 6th subject) and result of Class X will be computed based on best five subjects.

However, if a student desires to reappear in the failed subject, he or she may appear along with the compartment examination.

Similarly, at senior secondary level, the board has advised schools to offer at least one or more skill-based subject as elective subject out of the 42 subjects.

""The board will provide necessary support and guidance towards training and capacity building of teachers and other aspects for the successful implementation of skill subjects from time to time,"" the official added.

I felt like Stuart Broad when Yuvraj Singh walloped me for three successive sixes: Yuzvendra Chahal 

","
BENGALURU: Royal Challengers Bangalore spinner Yuzvendra Chahal said he felt like Stuart Broad when Mumbai Indians' veteran swashbuckler Yuvraj Singh smashed three sixes in one of his overs.


Yuvraj struck Chahal for consecutive sixes in the 14th over of the match which Mumbai won by six runs on Thursday night.

""When he (Yuvraj) hit three sixes, I felt like Stuart Broad,"" Chahal said referring to the six consecutive maximums in the 2007 T20 World Cup that Yuvraj had hit off Englishman Broad.

However, Chahal managed to get Yuvraj off the fourth delivery of his over, caught by Mohammad Siraj in the deep after he had scored a quick-fire 23 off 12 balls.

""You know he is a legend batsman and I backed myself. I had to bowl a bit up, might be a chance to get him out because it is a smaller ground. So that time, I thought of bowling my best delivery and he got sixes. That you cannot help and hence I bowled a wider googly,"" he told reporters in post-match session.

On September 19, 2007, in a World T20 match in Durban, Yuvraj had scripted a carnage by walloping six sixes off Broad in an over during a 16-ball 58.

Speaking about the wicket, Chahal said since it was good for batting, he varied his pace, especially for the big-hitting Kieron Pollard.

""The wicket was not turning. It was good for batting. So, the plan was to vary my pace, like bowling slower ones and sometimes sliders too,"" he said.

PSG fans give Chelsea women a tough time 

","
PARIS: There were around 600 of them. But the noise made you believe there were 20,000. The PSG Ultras, the renowned fan group, were out in full force in the Women's Champions League quarterfinal second-leg between PSG and Chelsea in Paris on Wednesday.


Not often you get to see such passionate support for the women's game even for some of the biggest clubs in the world. It was not just the ultras who were egging on the PSG women. Approximately, 10,000 turned up for game at the Stade Jean-Bouin, a stone's throw away from the Parc des Princes, the home ground of the PSG men.

There was an extra edge to the match against Chelsea. In the first-leg of the quarterfinals, the PSG supporters were denied entry by the police in London. Allegedly, some of the Ultras were found to be in possession of weapons and drugs.

The PSG management, though, came out in support of their fans and criticized the British Police of unfairly targetting their supporters. Chelsea won the first leg 2-0 thanks to goals from Hannah Blundell and Erin Cuthbert and now had to deal with the vociferous PSG ultras.

It was clear from the beginning that the Chelsea women had to deal with the hostile atmosphere and hold their nerves in order to preserve their lead and advance. The Ultras got into the business straightaway. with their chants, banners and firecrackers. 'Treated as criminals', 'Deprived from our freedom', read some of the banners in English.

The intimidating atmosphere got to the Chelsea players. The PSG women were in control of the game from the beginning. Had they been a bit more clinical, they could have gone ahead in the first half itself.

But the goals duly came after the break. Kadidiatou Diani scored two minutes into the second half. An own goal by Chelsea's Ann-Katrin Berger made it 2-0 to PSG and 2-2 on aggregate. The Ultras, in the stand opposite to the dugout, started to light flares and sing 'Alles Paris Saint-Germain', the club anthem, in perfect harmony. The temperature hovered around five degree Celsius on a cold Wednesday evening but you could see plenty of men with no shirts, oblivious to the clime.

Jet Airways News: Planes grounded, Jet Airways sends expat pilots on leave without pay 

","
NEW DELHI: 

  Jet Airways
 + has started sending its pilots - most likely only the expats - on furloughs, or leaves without pay. Expat pilots cost nearly twice as much as their Indian counterparts as they have to be given accommodation and flight tickets to their home country every few weeks. Since Jet is now operating 35 of its once-upon-a-time fleet of 124 planes, the lender-led management has begun cutting this extra cost. The airline is trying to take this number to 75 by April 26, still leaving it pilot surplus.


Sources say only expat pilots are being sent on furlough. Despite repeated attempts, Jet did not comment on how many expats it has and if the offer is being made to them only. 



With just one-fourth of operational fleet, Jet suspends services to 13 international routes till end-AprilJet Airways has suspended operations on 13 more international routes till end-April and grounded seven more planes due to non-payment of rentals, taking the number of such aircraft to 54. The airline has also reduced frequencies on seven other overseas routes, mostly from Delhi and Mumbai. From 600 daily flights operations reduced to one-fourth.


""Due to the reduced network and fleet plan, the company's pilot requirements on your fleet have reduced and your services will not be required… as an interim arrangement, we are offering furlough to pilots. Accordingly, we hereby offer you furlough of your employment with effect from April 01, 2019 till further notice,"" a letter issued to an expat pilot of Boeing 737 on Thursday said.

""Please consider this letter as notice to furlough your employment with us. We will periodically assess pilot requirements and advise you accordingly,"" it adds. During the furlough, pilots will not not receive salary, any other monetary benefit, accommodation and medical insurance. 

""However, you will continue to be eligible for free passages as per the prevailing staff travel policy of the company. You shall maintain recency / validity of your licenses / medical during the period of furlough. In case your employment contract ceases during the term of this furlough arrangement, the furlough arrangement contemplated herein shall automatically come to an end on the date of cessation of the employment contract,"" the letter says.

In the last two months, Jet has seen several of its pilots leave. They along with aircraft engineers and senior management are awaiting payment of last three to four months' salaries. 

Expat pilots have always been a touchy issue in almost all Indian carriers. Last August when Jet had proposed 15 per cent pay cut for pilots, the airline had even then issued ad to hire expats. When Indian pilots questioned the move of cutting their salaries yet continuing to hire expats, the then management had said salary of expat pilots would also be deducted. The salary deduction move did not happen and the airline later was not in a position to pay salaries to the level of employees with big pay packages.

Karnataka: Bride throws up, groom gets virginity test done 

","
BENGALURU: An unwell bride who threw up minutes after tying the knot was allegedly made to undergo virginity and pregnancy tests by her spouse without her knowledge. The woman has taken her husband to court for suspecting her fidelity and harassing her. 


 The HR professional has not admitted to his mistake during counselling sessions conducted by Aparna Purnesh, a counsellor at Parihar family counselling centre (Vanitha Sahayavani) attached to Bengaluru city police. 

According to Sahayavani sources, the couple from North Karnataka - Sharath, 29, and Raksha, 26, (names changed) - who are MBA graduates and employed with reputed firms, met on a matrimonial site. After a few days of interaction, they decided to marry in November 2018.

Fifteen days before marriage, Raksha lost her mother to cancer. As Raksha went into depression, Sharath thought she wasn't happy with the marriage. 


Woman signed consent forms without checking

Meanwhile, Raksha spoke to one of her friends from her hometown, who supported her during tough times. Here too, Sharath mistook her.

On the day of marriage, Raksha vomited due to gastritis and Sharath immediately took her to a hospital. While Raksha assumed she was taken to hospital due to gastritis, she was in for a shock when she realised in the ward room that doctors were testing her for pregnancy and virginity.

Soon after the tests, Raksha lashed out at Sharath before leaving for her sister’s house, where she started staying. Three months later, Sharath came to the Parihar family counselling centre and filed a complaint against his wife. To defuse the marital dispute, the centre summoned Raksha. But counsellors were shocked to learn of ordeals Raksha went through.

“Raksha told us she did not know she was being put through virginity and pregnancy tests and that she signed the consent forms without looking into the details. She got to know about the tests only when they were almost done. On Raksha’s request, the centre tried to counsel Sharath but he did not respond,” Aparna told TOI.

Raksha has filed complaints with police and court against Sharath for harassment and suspecting her fidelity. The husband has filed for divorce.

Rani Shetty, coordinator of the counselling centre, said, “Raksha’s father passed away long ago and she lost her mother a few days before marriage. Instead of consoling her, Sharath misunderstood her and subjected her to tests without consent, which is illegal. We are providing her necessary assistance from the centre.”

Nasa publishes images of the meteor no one saw - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: Nasa on Friday published satellite photos of a powerful meteor which appeared just above the Bering Sea on December 18 but went unnoticed until months later.

The explosion unleashed around 173 kilotons of energy, more than 10 times that of the atomic bomb blast over Hiroshima in World War II.

Images captured minutes after the fireball disintegrated in the atmosphere show the shadow of the meteor's trail cast on top of clouds, elongated by the sun's low position.

The super-heated air turns the clouds to an orange tint in the meteor's wake.

The photographs were taken by two Nasa instruments on board the Terra satellite.

A still image was taken at 2350 GMT, while five of the of nine cameras on the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument took another sequence of photos at 2355, which Nasa collated into a GIF that shows the orange trail

Nasa estimates that the meteor occurred at 23:48 GMT.

Meteors are rocks from outer space that become incandescent upon entering earth's atmosphere as a result of friction. They are also known as shooting stars. Pieces which survive intact and hit the ground are known as meteorites.

It was the most powerful explosion in the atmosphere since the fireball that burst over the Russian town of Chelyabinsk in 2013. That was 440 kilotons, and left 1,500 people injured, mostly from glass flying out of smashed windows.

This time around, the blast occurred over waters, hundreds of kilometers off the Russian coast.

The first photo of the event was taken by a Japanese weather satellite and published only this week.

Twitter Light Out: Twitter rolls out 'lights out' dark mode for iPhones - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: The micro-blogging website Twitter has announced that it is rolling out a new update for the iOS users. The update brings the new 'Lights Out' feature which claims to make the existing Dark Mode darker. 

Twitter made this announcement via a tweet which reads, ""It was dark. You asked for darker! Swipe right to check out our new dark mode. Rolling out today.""


It was dark. You asked for darker! Swipe right to check out our new dark mode. Rolling out today. https://t.co/6MEACKRK9K— Twitter (@Twitter) 1553792419000

The new Light Out toggle button is placed in the Settings menu of the Twitter app and it can be used with the present Dark Mode available in the app. 

In January this year, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said that the company is working on a new Dark Mode option as it received a lot of complains that the existing Dark Mode was more Blue than Black. The Dark Mode which was earlier introduced by the company is now the 'Dim' Dark Mode with a Blue greyish colour. On the other hand, the Lights Out mode consist of pure Black colour. 

Along with this Twitter has also added an Automatic Dark Mode feature for iOS users which will automatically turn on the Dark Mode on the basis of timezone. The Lights Out feature is only limited to iOS devices for now but is soon expected to come to Android and desktop as well.

Earlier this month it was reported that Twitter is working on a new feature called hide reply. The company's senior product manager Michelle Yasmeen Haq said, ""People who start interesting conversations on Twitter are really important to us, and we want to empower them to make the conversations they start (remain) as healthy as possible by giving them some control.""

The new hide reply feature will enable the person who started the conversation to choose and hide the replies to their tweets. The hidden replies will only be viewed by other users by going to the menu option.

Nirav Modi possibly owns two flats, not one, in London skyscraper - Times of India

","
LONDON: Wanted diamantaire Nirav Modi will be making his second court appearance in London on Friday when his lawyers are expected to make a second bail application for him.


The 48-year-old has been languishing in 

  one of Britain's most overcrowded prisons
 + - Wandsworth prison - since March 20 when he was remanded in custody after his first bail application was rejected by district judge Marie Mallon despite offering £500,000 as security and offering to report regularly at his local police station.



Nirav Modi's art collection fetches Rs 54 crore55 rare oil paintings by some of India’s finest artists like—V S Gaitonde, Raja Ravi Varma, F N Souza, K K Hebbar, Jogen Chowdhury, Akbar Padamsee, Arpana Caur—seized from fugitive jeweller Nirav Modi’s collection by tax authorities went under the hammer on Tuesday and fetched Rs 54 cr. Leading the sales was an untitled oil on canvas by Gaitonde that sold for Rs 22 cr.


On Friday Nirav, who is accused by the government of India of being involved in the fraudulent issuing of letters of undertaking (LoUs) in respect of Punjab National Bank worth £1.2 billion, will face a different judge at Westminster magistrates' court - the chief magistrate, Emma Arbuthnot, who oversaw the extradition trial of Vijay Mallya.

He will arrive in a prison van and appear in the dock. His barrister is expected to increase his bail security offer. The CBI and ED have flown over to attend the hearing and meet the UK legal team representing the government of India in the case.

Nirav is using the same solicitor as Mallya - Anand Doobay. Doobay's company, Boutique Law, boasts on its website: ""We have substantial experience acting for clients facing money laundering investigations and prosecutions. Our extensive experience of defending allegations of corruption and bribery involves cases both in the UK and overseas. We can also assist with applying to Interpol for access to information or for information including red notices to be amended or deleted.""

TOI can also reveal that Nirav owns not one but two £8 million flats in the 82-apartment skyscraper Centre Point where he lives. Both were paid for in cash.

Nirav has been living in the 2,133-sq-ft three-bedroom luxury apartment 42 on the 29th floor of Centre Point tower in central London since January 2018. The title deeds, which TOI has possession of, show that apartment 42, which is the address he gave in court, that is also linked to Diamond Holdings, was sold to a ""Richard Beattie"" on January 5, 2018 for £7,950,000 in cash. The same date, flat 5, also on the 29th floor, was also sold to Richard Beattie in cash for the same price. Both are registered as care of a London law firm that provides advice to wealthy individuals.

A well-placed source told TOI: ""I think the safe thing to assume is that Nirav Modi is Richard Beattie. Both flats have Nirav Modi's footprints all over them. He has probably asked someone like his butler or an accountant to put their name on the title deeds so he cannot be traced.""

The spokeswoman for the said law firm said: ""We are not able to comment on this.""

TOI also tracked down the London office of Diamond Holdings, the jewellery business that Nirav started on May 24, 2018, which is registered at the Harrow address of his accountants. The actual office though is situated in a secluded spot on the upper floors of a Georgian townhouse in Soho Square, which also houses 20th Century Fox, close to the Radha-Krishna Temple and the restaurant Govinda's. The white blinds were pulled down completely on the middle to upper floors when TOI visited as Krishna devotees were singing and dancing close by. There is no signage to Diamond Holdings on the exterior of the building. A company that lets out office space runs the building and lets out sections of it. Office spaces are let for a minimum of £3,850 per month with seven desks to £19,500 per month for 30 desks on minimum 12-month leases, TOI discovered.

The receptionist on the ground floor confirmed Diamond Holdings was in an office upstairs but said no one was allowed in to see them without prior appointment. ""We manage office spaces and they have let some. I have been told not to let anyone up there unless they have an appointment,"" he said.

When asked if Diamond Holdings was the only office there, he said, ""No, we have others,"" but gave the impression there was a team of staff working for Diamond Holdings.

""The secretary of Diamond Holdings has already gone home and she asked me not to let anyone in without an appointment. I don't know what they do or how long they have been here. I don't have any telephone number I can give you,"" he said.

RCB vs MI: Jasprit Bumrah chokes RCB at death as Mumbai Indians win by 6 runs 

","
BENGALURU: The vociferous crowd at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium was still celebrating home skipper Virat Kohli's personal milestone of 5,000 runs - the second by a player after Suresh Raina - when Jasprit Bumrah (3/20), unleashed a short ball which Kohli (46, 32b, 6x4), who hadn't scored a boundary in 10 balls, tried to pull.
 


 IPL Schedule| IPL Points Table | Scorecard
The delivery took flight but didn't go the distance and was pouched by Hardik Pandya at midwicket. The contest between arguably the finest pacer and batsman was won by the former.



Chasing 188 for victory was always going to be a daunting task and Royal Challengers Bangalore needed 72 off 28 balls when the skipper departed. But Mumbai had AB de Villers (70 no, 41b, 4x4, 6x6) to contend with. Up stepped ABD slamming Lasith Malinga for 20 runs in the 16th over and the 18th over from Hardik Pandya yielded 18 runs, but Bumrah still turned the match on its head.

It's not for nothing that the wily pacer is one of the most feared death-over specialist. In the 17th over he accounted for Shimron Hetmyer and conceded a single run and in the penultimate over he sent back a struggling Colin de Grandhomme while giving away only five runs.

Needing 17 runs off the last over, de Villiers slammed Malinga over the ropes off the first ball, but the Sri Lankan, who joined the team only on Wednesday night, weighed in with his experience and Mumbai won by six runs with the hosts finishing with 181/5.



Earlier, RCB bowlers and MI batsmen oscillated between being good and ordinary. A case in point was the 14th over of Mumbai's innings in which leggie Yuzvendra Chahal (4/38) conceded 20 runs which saw Yuvraj Singh cart him for three consecutive maximums before being dismissed off the fourth delivery. On the other hand, pacer Umesh Yadav, bowling the 17th over, was measly giving away only two runs and claimed a wicket.

Even as the home side seemed like they were in control of the death overs, the big-hitting Hardik flexed his muscles with an unbeaten 14-ball 32 (2x4, 3x6) to take the visiting side to a competitive 187/8. Forty runs came off the last 17 balls.

Put into bat by the home team skipper Virat Kohli, the visitors were off to a good start provided by Rohit Sharma (48, 33b, 8x4, 1x6) with his fellow opener Quinton de Kock (23, 20, 3x4, 1x6) a tad slow off the blocks. On a wicket which offered the bowlers early pace, Rohit was quick to react. He made his intent clear as he struck consecutive boundaries off Umesh Yadav's bowling and added a couple more off Navdeep Saina in the flowing over as Mumbai piled 52 runs in powerplay. De Kock survived on 16 as Colin de Grandhomme put him down at midwicket off Saini's bowling. But the South African didn't make much of the lifeline.

Introduced in the seventh over, Chahal struck immediately, with de Kock losing his stumps as he tried to reverse sweep a googly.

Suryakumar Yadav (38, 24b, 4x4, 1x6) then decided to go after the bowlers in the company of Yuvraj Singh. After Yuvraj, Chahal, who got crucial wickets despite going for runs, sent back Yadav.

The hosts decided to go with an unchanged squad, while Mumbai brought in Lasith Malinga and Mayank Markande in place of Ben Cutting and Rasikh Khan.

Masood Azhar: US, China in bitter showdown at UN over sanctions on Masood Azhar 

","
The US and China seem headed for a showdown at the UN over Jaish chief Masood Azhar with Beijing accusing Washington of ""forcefully moving"" a resolution in the Security Council intended to compel China to make public its reasons for stalling efforts to tag him as a ""global terrorist"".


With Beijing persisting with a ""technical hold"", preventing the sanctions committee of the UNSC from designating the Jaish-e-Muhammed chief as a terrorist, Washington has sought to raise the heat by seeking a discussion in the council - inviting a sharp Chinese retort that it should act with caution.

Acting with the support of France and the UK, the US bumped up the issue of listing Azhar on Wednesday.



China draws ire of other UNSC members for saving Jaish chief Masood AzharA day after Beijing used its veto to stall the sanctions committee’s near-unanimous decision to designate Azhar a terrorist, a Security Council diplomat said China should not prevent the UN panel from doing its job, and Beijing’s move to hold the listing was ""inconsistent with its own stated goals of combating terrorism and furthering regional stability in South Asia.""


The move came two weeks after China, for the fourth time, put a hold on a proposal to list him under the 1267 Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee of the council.

Never before has a terrorist of interest to India been targeted at the council in this manner. The other 14 members of the council are said to be supporting the proposed ban. 

Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said in Beijing that the 

  US was undermining the authority of the sanctions committee
 + . ""This is not in line with resolution of the issue through dialogue and negotiations. This has reduced the authority of the committee as a main anti-terrorism body of the UNSC and this is not conducive to the solidarity and only complicates the issue,"" Geng said.

""We urge the US to act cautiously and avoid forcefully moving forward this resolution draft,"" China said, using unusually blunt language as the Trump administration made good its expressed intent to take the JeM chief's issue to the UNSC since the sanctions committee had been repeatedly thwarted.

Adding to the friction was US secretary of state Mike Pompeo calling out the contradiction of China's forcible detention of Uighur Muslims while supporting terror groups like JeM. ""The world cannot afford China's shameful hypocrisy toward Muslims. On one hand, China abuses more than a million Muslims at home, but on the other, it protects violent Islamic terrorist groups from sanctions at the UN,"" Pompeo said.

The US resolve in pushing China reflects a determination to press down on Pakistan in the wake of the JeM claiming responsibility for the suicide bombing in Pulwama despite its efforts to withdraw from Afghanistan, a strategy that is seen to require the cooperation of Pakistan. Its cruciality to US plans is seen as a factor that emboldens the Pakistan military to ""sanction"" a big attack in J&K.

The US move means that China, if it doesn't lift the ""technical hold"", will likely have to explain publicly for the first time the rationale behind its support to the leader of a UN-designated terrorist group. It is understood that the next step for the council is to have informal discussions on the resolution.

Though China as a permanent member can veto the draft resolution in the UNSC, the development further isolates Beijing at a time when the international community is running out of patience with Pakistan's sponsorship of terrorism and China's decision to shield it. JeM's claim for the Pulwama attack only deepened the unease. Proceedings of the sanctions committee were in camera but a UNSC vote, if it comes to that, will be on record.

The US-China clash over Azhar came against the backdrop of Pompeo meeting a delegation of Uighur Muslims, tens of thousands of whom are said to have been corralled in internment camps as Beijing tries to staunch what it sees as Islamic radicalism.

If the council fails to arrive at a consensus, then it could consider putting the resolution to vote, leading to an open discussion. The US, France and the UK, which have worked together to bring the proposal, will hope in such a scenario that China, fearing isolation, abstains to allow the ban to go through.

Bombay HC lets college student with depression write exam 

","
MUMBAI: Coming to the rescue of a second year bachelor of accounting and finance student from Mithibai College who was barred from exams after she missed classes for two months due to ""depression and other medical issues"", the Bombay high court on Tuesday allowed her to take her tests. The court clarified that this was an interim relief and will be subject to the final outcome of her writ petition. 


According to the student's petition: She has a good academic record, with 96% in SSC and 91% in HSC. With the aim of making a career in accounting, she joined the college in 2017 and cleared three semesters with A+ scores. In November 2018, she took ill and underwent various medical tests. As her condition deteriorated, her local guardian was advised by doctors to keep her under parental supervision, considering she was a depression survivor. She went back to her hometown where she was diagnosed with depression and severe neurological problems due to a deficiency of vitamins B12 and D3. She was unable to attend college till January 2019 and her father informed the college.

The petition goes on to state: She later resumed college. For the exams, she was asked to submit her leave application for the period she was absent. She received a letter on March 16 informing her that her term was not granted. Her petition states that the college told her that the minimum attendance required was 75%, but 50% too was acceptable; her's was 44.5%.

The student's petition said: She went to the principal on March 18, who refused to see the medical papers or her appeal and cited university rules on the subject. When she approached the registrar of the university, she was informed that the decision solely rested with the college principal as the institution was autonomous.

In her petition, seeking relief, the student said she would suffer irreparably if she lost an academic year. She said she was a depression survivor, had a history of the condition from 2016, and it had caused her to take an academic gap earlier.

She submitted her medical papers, mark sheets and communication from the college to the high court. 

Advocates Swapana Kode and Sidharth Samantaray represented the student before the high court.

Giving her interim relief, the court said: ""Taking into consideration the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, excellent academic career of the petitioner (student) and medical report placed on record... we direct (the college) to permit the petitioner to appear in the examination commencing tomorrow (Wednesday).""

There is a widespread belief that most ruling governments are not re-elected by voters. In our analysis of big and medium-sized states, in the period 1977–2002, 70% of governments were thrown out by angry, dissatisfied voters. However, this has changed over the last 20 years. To put it simply, the anti-incumbency era is over. India is now going through what can be called a ‘Fifty:Fifty Era’. Governments today have a 50:50 chance of being re-elected. Governments that perform are voted back. Those that do not deliver are voted out. The angry voter has given way to a wiser, more mature voter.



Young voters, old MPs



Our members of Parliament are much older than the average age of voters. Once again, expect older candidates as the average age of members of the Lok Sabha has been rising with every election. Today, 59% of voters in India are young, between the ages of 18 and 40. But only 15% of MPs are between 25 and 40 years old. This means that 85% of MPs are of a different generation from the majority of voters. And it’s a widening age gap.



Expect 2019 to be the ‘election of the women of India’ but who will they vote for
Women’s participation in elections has been rising much faster than men, and the next Lok Sabha elections could be the first time in India’s history that their turnout will be higher than men. But who do women vote for? Traditionally, the BJP has had a higher support base amongst men than women. Which is why the government’s free gas cylinder policy (Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana) was a perfect election campaign idea; it targeted primarily rural, women voters. All parties can now be expected to make similar promises targeting women in these elections. To illustrate how important the male voter is for the NDA, a simple simulation of the 2014 elections threw up two alternative scenarios. First, if only men had voted, the NDA would have won as many as 376 seats (40 seats more than the 336 that they actually won). Second, if only women had voted, the NDA would have won only 265 seats (71 seats lower than their final total in 2014 and 7 seats below the halfway mark of 272).




The biggest shame of 2019...21 million missing women voters
Early estimates suggest that as many as 21 million eligible women voters will be denied their right to vote in 2019 simply because their names have been excluded... To place this number of missing women voters in perspective: it is equal to 39,000 women missing in every constituency in this country.





Disappearing Independents

Having understood the unfairness of the first-past-the-post system, voters are increasingly ignoring Independents. The vote for Independents has dropped from 13% in the earlier years to just 4% today. Victims of the system, they will be all but irrelevant in this election.





No longer a national election; it’s a true federation-of-states election
The number of seats won by regional parties has risen from an average of 35 Lok Sabha seats in the early phase after Independence to over 160 seats now, almost a third of the seats in the Lok Sabha, and the trend is decidedly upwards. Even more significant is the rapid increase in the votes that regional parties are now winning. In the early phase of Indian elections, regional parties won 4% of the vote, this has now risen to 34% of the national vote in Lok Sabha elections. The end of the all-India ‘uniform-swing’ will play a crucial role in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The importance of strong sub-national parties will create state-level swings and relegate the phenomenon of a national swing to a memory from the past. It’s probably best not to focus exclusively on the ‘Modi-Shah-appeal’ or the ‘Rahul-Priyanka-effect’ or even the ‘Modi-Rahul-contest’ in 2019. Increasingly, it is the ‘state-leader-impact’ that will be more relevant.



What will be more important for victory: votes or dividing the Opposition?

In the past, winning the popular vote yielded more seats than a fragmented Opposition. In fact in every Lok Sabha election victory between 1952 and 2002, the ruling party won about two-thirds of its seats because of a high popular vote and only one-third of the seats were won due to the effect of a divided Opposition. The impact of Opposition unity on seats is rising with every election, from an average of 33% in the first two phases to 45% in the last three Lok Sabha elections. So in 2019, expect alliances between parties to play a very crucial role.





On vote counting day, watch out for the ‘Bump’
Do not make the mistake of walking away from your television set on counting day when all the ‘leads’ are in. Major changes happen as more and more rounds are counted. Nothing sinister, it is merely a statistical phenomenon that happens in every election — and benefits the leading party, no matter which party is leading. The party that is ahead when all the leads are in gets an amazing ‘Bump’ in actual seats once all the results are in. For Lok Sabha elections, when all the 543 ‘leads’ are in but counting is still in progress, be prepared to add another forty-five seats to the leading party’s tally and subtract about the same number from the trailing parties’ total. In other words, be prepared for as much as a forty-five-seat Bump, or what could be up to a ninety-seat swing.

‘Technoference’ disrupting sleep, productivity among teenagers - Times of India

","
QUEENSLAND: Almost half of young people aged between 18 to 24 have reported feeling less productive and more tired because of their mobile phones, new research has found. An increased number of people are experiencing what scientists describe as “technoference”, which is when mobile phone use causes interruptions during everyday life.


Researchers from Queensland University of Technology (QUT) conducted a study to determine whether “problematic use of mobile phones” is worsening in Australia. According to their findings, published in the scientific journal Frontiers, 24% of women and 15% of men could be categorised as “problematic mobile phone users”.

They also found that 40.9% of 18- to 24-year-olds and 23.5% of 25- to 29-year-olds are suffering from “technoference”.

Oscar Oviedo-Trespalacios, from QUT’s Centre of Accident Research and Road Safety, explains that “technoference” refers to “everyday intrusions and interruptions that people experience due to mobile phones and their usage.”

The team assessed 709 mobile phone users across the country, aged between 18 to 83.

The participants filled out a survey, during which they were asked questions concerning whether they blame their phones for losing sleep, becoming less productive, driving unsafely and experiencing physical pain. The survey, which was conducted in 2018, replicated questions from a similar survey from 2005. The team found that one in five women and one in eight men say that they now lose sleep due to the time they spend on their mobile phones.

This number had increased by 17.2% for women and 8.6% for men over the course of 13 years. In terms of productivity, 12.6% of the male participants and 14% of the female participants noted a decline in their productivity levels due to the time they spend on their phones. “Self-reports relating to loss of sleep and productivity showed that these negative outcomes had significantly increased during the last 13 years,” says Oscar Oviedo-Trespalacios.

Lok Sabha elections: How BJP beats Congress in turning votes into seats

","
Much of BJP's dominance in electoral politics in the past five years has been credited to PM Modi and party chief Amit Shah. While the duo did lead BJP to a sweeping majority in 2014, the ground for that may have been laid much before their time.


Analysis of election data from 1996 to 2009, including the two terms of the Congress-led UPA, shows that the strike rate of BJP contestants was far better than those fielded by the grand old party. The percentage of BJP candidates winning was higher in all but one election (2009), including in 2004 when the UPA-I assumed office.

That Congress also fielded more candidates than BJP could have affected its winning percentage, but as experts explain, ""BJP's success in building a national narrative had been in the pipeline since 1992"".




Veteran BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa told TOI: ""Narendra Modi was a Gujarat CM and was working in that capacity for the party. But from the time of Vajpayee, we worked across the breadth and length of this country with leaders like Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi, and at a time all this was taking a more concrete shape, Modi was projected as the PM candidate and naturally it got converted into votes.""

1n 1999, when the BJP-led NDA came to power under Vajpayee, 57% of BJP candidates had won, against 25% from the rival party.

In 1996, 34% of all BJP contestants won, compared to 26% of Congress candidates; in 2004, when UPA eventually formed the government, 38% of BJP candidates won, against 35% for Congress. In 1998 and 1999, when NDA ruled, BJP candidates had a much higher winnability record compared to Congress.

""You can map the timeline of how we grew from Gujarat and Rajasthan to Karnataka and the northeast. It was between 1996 and 1998 that the party emerged nationally. In 2014, we did reach the peak as there was 'partial consolidation' because of the spiralling growth of the middle class and youth which came in handy,"" BJP spokesperson Krishna Sagar Rao said.

At a discussion last month, psephologists spoke of how the 2014 LS polls were critical in setting the ground for a narrative on New India. ""If BJP comes back to power you will see this narrative getting stronger by 2024. But even if the party fails to retain power, the idea won't die, such was the nature of the elections in 2014,"" said Suhas Palshikar.

""India Shining may not have worked for BJP electorally in that year (2004), but the exercise of building a national narrative that has engaged people had begun and that was the first attempt. Today, the Naya Bharat campaign is not just a linguistic nuance but a sustained effort at consolidation,"" Palshikar said.

Instagram video feature: You may soon be able to scroll through an Instagram video, rewind it and more - Times of India

","
Instagram, the popular photo and video sharing app owned by Facebook is getting a much-needed feature it seems. Soon, the app might let you quickly jump to a particular second in a video or rewind it, something we are not able to do just yet. For now, one would have to go through the entire video at once or play it again if they missed a part. The new feature of jumping to a particular second inside the video is possible due to a video seek bar, which showed up in an Instagram apk file according to a developer named @wongmjane.

Wong showcased the new feature in a gif video in a tweet stating ‘Instagram is testing video seek bar’. The video shows how one can simply tap on the video timeline running on top of the particular post and drag it to the particular part of interest. If Instagram is indeed testing this feature, it could come as a welcome change for many but on the downside would reduce the engagement time for video posts. There is no confirmation yet if this feature will be reaching to the masses or if it’s under tests.


Instagram is testing video seekbar https://t.co/gyIZZhrh2y— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) 1553721672000

For what’s worth, this is not the first time that this feature has been spotted. Instagram apparently showed us a glimpse of it back in January last year as well. “Stumbled across the fact that you can now fast forward & rewind Instagram videos last night. Simply press & hold on the screen then move your finger. Don’t think this has been out long. #Social,” tweeted @theJBECK in January 2018.

Talking about testing new features, recently Instagram was spotted testing selector wheel format to show different filter options for ‘Stories’. The semi-circular wheel was also spotted by the same developer. “Instagram is working on new 'Stories' user-interface, inspired from mechanical circular mode switcher in DSLRs. Tabs reduced to just 'Live', 'Normal' and 'Create',"" Wong tweeted.

Oppo’ upcoming smartphone lineup under the new sub-brand Reno has been making a buzz recently. It is now rumoured to come with a pop-up camera that wedges out from one side. This wedge-shaped camera houses the selfie camera along with the LED flash. This new set of information come from the case images shared by SlashLeaks. 

The back of the smartphone can be seen sporting a vertically aligned dual rear camera. LED flash is placed below the camera setup.

The leaked case renders also suggest that the phone will include a 3.5mm headphone jack, USB Type-C port and a speaker grille at the bottom.

vivo smartphone: Design innovations help Vivo become the fastest growing smartphone brand in India: Report - Times of India

","
Moving beyond the specs-price battle in the highly competitive Indian market, Chinese smartphone brand Vivo appears to be slowly emerging as one of the favourite in the country. Vivo is among the first to introduce design innovations in its phones like a popup selfie camera, in-display fingerprint scanner and a screen SoundCasting tech in which the display itself doubles up as a speaker. And it seems, this strategy to introduce design innovations across all price points is doing well for 
Vivo. 

Citing the latest market tracker report from research firm GfK, the company claimed itself as the fastest growing brand with 63.2% growth in terms of value and 60.9% growth in terms of volume in January 2019 versus January 2018. 

“We have a strong and diversified product portfolio in the Rs 8-10k, Rs 11-20k, Rs 20-25k and above Rs 30k segment to address the overall smartphone market in India. By launching devices in both the less than Rs 20K segment (Y series) and the Rs 20K plus segment (V series), we were able to secure 15.8% growth in terms of value and 13% growth in terms of volume, in Q4 of 2018, versus Q3 of 2018 despite the industry growing of merely 2.6 % and 5.2% in volume and value respectively (as per GfK),” said Nipun Marya, director, brand strategy, Vivo India. 

While rivals could negate this sudden growth, the brand seems to have positioned itself well in India. “We are focused on establishing itself as a long-term player in India with emphasis on providing innovative products. Owing to the right product mix, innovative marketing and robust distribution network, we have seen an encouraging growth over the last 4 years. As we gear up for our next growth phase, we have elevated our proposition from just music & camera to an ‘innovation lead’ brand and our products speak volumes for the same,” said Marya. 

Vivo recently flaunted a concept phone dubbed as Apex 2019, which doesn’t come with any port, button, selfie camera or even a SIM card slot. Dubbed as a ‘holeless phone’, Vivo thinks Apex could be the future -- a smartphone with just a display and no other distractions. 

“2019 will be the year Vivo will be recognized beyond than just a smartphone with a focus towards camera and music, but a brand that is fueled by innovation. We will bring products that deliver an extraordinary experience and will continue to provide product across price points. We are already the number 2 brand in the market in terms of value (as per GFK) and are confident that our growth will continue in the Indian market not just this but also in the coming years,” said Marya.

So according to a report by IT Home, the Lenovo Z6 Pro is expected to come equipped with a 100MP camera.

The report also adds that the smartphone might also sport an in-display fingerprint sensor and wireless charging support. Another online report suggest that last year Qualcomm announced that its processors already offer support for images which are more than 100MP in resolution.

Earlier, the Cheng announced that the company will launch the

Telegram Delete Chat Feature: Telegram brings ultimate 'kill switch' for your chats - Times of India

","
Facebook’s WhatsApp is popular for its end-to-end encryption. Just like WhatsApp, Telegram is another chat app service that delivers end-to-end encryption and has more features. Now, keeping privacy at the forefront, Telegram has introduced the ‘Unsend Anything’ feature that essentially is the ultimate ‘kill switch’ to delete any message from any chat without any time limits.

“The ‘Unsend’ feature we introduced 2 years ago worked only for messages sent by you and only for 48 hours. Now you can “unsend” messages you have received as well, and there is no time limit. You can also delete any private chat entirely from both your and the other person's device with just two taps,” adds the Telegram blog post.

While this feature should come as a pleasant surprise for many, Telegram is bringing a couple of more features with the app version – Anonymous Forwarding and Settings Search.

Anonymous Forwarding strengthens the privacy even more by restricting who can forward your messages. “When this setting is enabled, your forwarded messages will no longer lead back to your account — they'll just display an unclickable name in the “from” field. This way people you chat with will have no verifiable proof you ever sent them anything,” adds the blog post.

To enable this, one would have to go to ‘Forwarded messages’ under the Privacy and Security settings.

The ‘Settings Search’ feature now lets you easily search for and settings you need in the ever-expanding list in the app. The search tool also answers any Telegram-related questions from the FAQ section.

In addition to these three apps, Telegram now has an upgraded GIF and sticker search. Large GIFs will now also be streamed so users don’t have to download it to view it. Android users can also search for emojis using keywords.

Finally, the update comes with support for accessibility features – VoiceOver on iOS and TalkBack on Android for easy access to features.

The image was found by 9to5Mac hidden in the new OS version. As per the image, the Powerbeats Pro seems similar to the Powerbeats3 in terms of design sans the connecting wire, indicating the company’s push towards making independent earbuds.

The earbuds can be seen housed inside the Beats-branded charging case in all Black. The accessory is also said to come in White colour variant. There is still no word as to when Apple plans to launch these wireless earbuds but since it has showed up on iOS 12.2, the launch might not be far enough.

According to a report by CNET, the new Powerbeats Pro might feature Apple’s H1 chip, which also powers the recently launched AirPods second-generation. It may also feature wireless charging and be water resistant. There’s also no word on the price of the wireless earbuds.

Sundar Pichai: Thanks to Donald Trump, Sundar Pichai is Google 'president' - Times of India

","
US president Donald Trump usually stays in the news for several reasons. However, he became a talking point in the tech industry recently when he called Apple CEO Tim Cook as ‘Tim Apple’. Now, he’s once again in the news for the same reason (kind of). This time president Trump called Google CEO Sundar Pichai with his incorrect designation – ‘President of Google’. 

Unlike last time, president Trump called Sundar Pichai as the ‘president of Google’ in a tweet, which is still live at the time of writing this article. He met Pichai and talked about being committed to the US military and not Chinese military. The meeting apparently ended ‘very well.’


Just met with @SundarPichai, President of @Google, who is obviously doing quite well. He stated strongly that he is… https://t.co/MkEveSi6u7— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1553715535000

“Just met with @SundarPichai, President of @Google, who is obviously doing quite well. He stated strongly that he is totally committed to the U.S. Military, not the Chinese Military....” said Trump in a tweet. “....Also discussed political fairness and various things that @Google can do for our Country. Meeting ended very well!”

The Verge notes that Google has four regional presidents that directly report to Pichai. Google’s parent company, Alphabet has Sergey Brin as the president. As for the meeting, Google representative told The Verge that “We were pleased to have productive conversations with the President about investing in the future of the American workforce, the growth of emerging technologies and our ongoing commitment to working with the U.S. government.”



This is how Apple CEO 'responded to' US president Donald Trump calling him Tim AppleDuring a White House meeting US President Donald Trump made an error by calling Apple CEO Tim Cook as Tim Apple. 


Earlier this month, when president Trump called Apple CEO as Tim Apple in a statement, the CEO did indicate later that he liked the idea and changed his name on the official Twitter account as Tim followed by the Apple emoji. The emoji, however, was not visible on non-Apple devices.

For those unaware, At the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board meeting at White House, Trump said “People like Tim -- you're expanding all over and doing things that I really wanted you to do right from the beginning. I used to say, 'Tim, you gotta start doing it here,' and you really have, you've really put a big investment in our country. We really appreciate it very much, Tim Apple.”

Apple rolls out watchOS 5.2 for Apple Watch: Here's what all it offers - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Cupertino-based tech giant Apple has rolled out a new update -- version watchOS 5.2 -- for its Apple Watch. The last update, watchOS 5.1.3, was rolled out more than two months ago.

As part of this update, Apple has rolled out the support for its ECG feature to Hong Kong and 19 European countries, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. 

""Part of the free watchOS 5.2 software update, the ECG app can capture heart rhythm on demand in a moment when users experience symptoms such as a rapid or skipped heart beat and help provide clinically important data to physicians. The irregular rhythm notification feature on Apple Watch occasionally checks heart rhythm in the background and sends a notification if an irregular heart rhythm that appears to be atrial fibrillation (AFib) is identified,"" said Apple. 

Besides the ECG support, the watchOS 5.2 also includes support for the second-generation AirPods, which will allow them to be used with the Apple Watch and support realtime text for phone calls.

Gmail App Swipes Feature: iPhone users, Gmail app has finally got this much-needed feature - Times of India

","
Google has already given Android users the privilege of customising the swiping gesture in the Gmail app to quickly delete, archive or mark emails as read/unread. However, iPhone (iOS) users still lacked the functionality until now. The search giant has finally announced that it is bringing the same email swiping features to Gmail’s iOS app as well. The idea behind this is to cut the extra time and thumb exercise that iPhone users had to do to delete, mark as read, archive, snooze and carry out other options for each mail.

“You can now set up swipe actions in Gmail on iOS to do any of the following actions: Archive, Trash, Mark as read/unread, Snooze, and Move to,” said the G suite blog post. The feature can be accessed by navigating through the Gmail iOS app’s Settings > Swipe actions, and choosing the function for left and right swipes. 

It is worth adding that swiping for each email is present in Gmail’s iOS app but swiping either left or right will show you the same function. With new customisation options you can change what shows when you swipe each mail towards left or right. 

Not just this but Gmail now also supports 3D Touch gesture for snoozing an email right from the notifications panel. “In addition to using swipe actions to quickly triage your email, you can also use the same actions to triage your notifications as well. For example, if you like to snooze emails, you can press firmly (3D Touch) or long press on a Gmail iOS notification, and click on ""Snooze"" directly to pick the date and time when to snooze the email until,” states the blog post.

It has been confirmed that swipe customisation features are already in the process of rolling out and is also available for all the G Suite editions. This new feature comes days after Google announced a major UI overhaul for the Gmail app.

Here's the 32-year old Apple credit card that you didn't see until now - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Earlier this week Apple took a major step in the payments and banking sector by introducing its titanium Apple Card. The card, as showcased during the company’s ‘Special Event’, is an actual credit card made out of titanium with minimalistic looks showing just the name of the cardholder, an integrated chip and the Apple logo. Although while many states this to be the Cupertino tech firm’s first ever credit, it actually is not. As interesting as it may sound, Apple launched it’s first credit card 32 years ago and the newest launch has triggered many to share images and thoughts about the old one on platforms like Twitter and Reddit.

As compiled by Cult of Mac, the card issued by Apple 32 years ago was a regular plastic one with the iconic rainbow-coloured Apple icon at the centre with the text ‘Apple Computer, Inc.’ mentioned below it. The card also showcased the number and the name of the cardholder. This one was for business users. 


Remember when Apple had a credit card in 1986? https://t.co/l2wE6EPIbn https://t.co/tsPHD3jdNO— Eric Fischer (@enf) 1553578591000
It has been reported that there was another card that was issued for customers. The second version of the old credit card had the Apple logo at the top left corner like what we’ve seen in the latest one along with the company name, card number and the name of the holder.

It is not for sure how many card Apple issue back in the 1980s and 90s and when they were discontinued. However, what’s mentioned is that tech magazines did run ads for the ‘Apple Business Credit Card’ and a consumer credit card, both with each worth $2500 in instant credit.

Out of the two, the business card came with a bonus offer wherein cardholders could trade in Apple Lisa or Macintosh XL for the new versions – Macintosh Plus and Hard Disk 20.

The 2019 Apple Card is directly built into the Apple Wallet app on iPhone and can be managed from there itself. The card will be available to customers in the US this summer. We expect it to arrive after the new iOS version is introduced at the upcoming WWDC 2019 conference.

NEW DELHI: The micro-blogging website Twitter has announced that it is rolling out a new update for the iOS users. The update brings the new 'Lights Out' feature which claims to make the existing Dark Mode darker.

gmail dynamic email: Gmail to make your emails 'dynamic', here's how - Times of India

","
Google keeps refreshing its Gmail service with new UI changes and features across platforms and this time it’s once again changing the way you see your emails and send a reply. According to Aakash Sahney, product manager at Gmail, your emails will not be more ‘dynamic’ than ever. That’s because you will soon be able to see a more interactive email from where you can RSVP to events, fill out a questionnaire, browse a catalogue or respond to a comment. 

Sahney also gave an example wherein a user mentions you in a comment inside a Google Docs document and instead of receiving an individual email notification, you will see a thread in Gmail. From there you can easily reply or resolve the comment, right from within the message, without leaving the Gmail window.

Some of the businesses that have already started using ‘dynamic emails’ in Gmail include Booking.com, Oyo Rooms, Redbus, Pinterest among others. For instance, with Oyo Rooms you will be able to browse hotels and rooms right from the email page itself, without changing the window.

Google has made it clear that businesses that want to send users dynamic emails, would have to follow certain guidelines laid out by the search giant. It will then be reviewed by Gmail before one can start sending it out. 

These ‘dynamic’ emails are based on AMP for emails project Google introduced early last year. The aim here is to make static pages in Gmail look like interactive ones and dynamic in nature. The search giant is probably late to the party as Microsoft’s Outlook, Mail.ru and Yahoo Mail already support AMP pages.

Sahney says that dynamic email support has already started rolling out to Gmail users on the web with the mobile support coming soon. G Suite admins can also enable this feature for their customers within the next few days. Also mentioned is that “If you’re using another mail app with Gmail, you’ll simply see the static version, and you can always revert back to it in Gmail, if you prefer.”

","
NEW DELHI: Popular Chinese social video app TikTok has already introduced some safety measures in China and US. Now, the company has started doing the same for India as well. The company has launched a localised version of its Safety Center, which is a local website that consists of safety policies, tools and resources to equip users with product education and protection measures when using TikTok.

The company also mentions that the Safety Center is available in ten major Indian languages and apart from guidelines, it also links out to two resource pages tackling Anti-Bullying as well as an advisory for the upcoming General Elections.

With the launch of this localised website, users across India can better understand various online safety settings and features to keep their accounts safe in their own language. They can also learn how to choose to keep their accounts private, as the website emphasises the need to use strong passwords and avoid the use of personal information. Additionally, users can learn how to enable the Restricted Mode that allows users to restrict content that might not be age-appropriate or even enable the Digital Wellness feature which limits the number of screen hours.

Speaking about the same, Helena Lersch, director, Global Public Policy, TikTok, said, ""Since the launch of TikTok in India, we have seen phenomenal user growth. Along with this growth, we also recognize the need to continuously equip our users with guidelines that would help them use TikTok in a safe and responsible way. With the launch of our localised Safety Center along with our resource pages for Anti-Bullying and the General Elections, we aim to reaffirm our commitment to India and ensure a safe and positive online environment.""

TikTok also recently launched its comments filter feature to helps users prevent predatory, hateful, and obscene comments from appearing on their videos. The feature lets users self-define keywords in English and Hindi that they would like to automatically filter out of unwelcome wording from their comment section. Users can add as many as 30 words and change the words according to their preference or when they feel necessary.

According to a report by TelecomTalk, the triple play plan offers unlimited voice calling, 100GB of high-speed data in addition to free Jio Home TV subscription and access to multiple Jio apps. 

The report further suggests that the plan comes with a validity of 28 days and is available exclusively to Reliance Jio employees who have opted out the FTTH connection. As the plan is under-testing stage, there are no charges. However, Jio is yet to officially confirm the plan.

Major takeaway from the latest report is the inclusion of Jio Home TV subscription in the ‘Triple Play’ plan.

It is important to note here that the Jio GigaTV is yet to be rolled out. 

Meanwhile, the company has reintroduced its Jio Celebration Pack. Under this, Jio customers will get 10GB of additional 4G data for a period of 5 days.

Instagram video feature: You may soon be able to scroll through an Instagram video, rewind it and more - Times of India

","
Instagram, the popular photo and video sharing app owned by Facebook is getting a much-needed feature it seems. Soon, the app might let you quickly jump to a particular second in a video or rewind it, something we are not able to do just yet. For now, one would have to go through the entire video at once or play it again if they missed a part. The new feature of jumping to a particular second inside the video is possible due to a video seek bar, which showed up in an Instagram apk file according to a developer named @wongmjane.

Wong showcased the new feature in a gif video in a tweet stating ‘Instagram is testing video seek bar’. The video shows how one can simply tap on the video timeline running on top of the particular post and drag it to the particular part of interest. If Instagram is indeed testing this feature, it could come as a welcome change for many but on the downside would reduce the engagement time for video posts. There is no confirmation yet if this feature will be reaching to the masses or if it’s under tests.


Instagram is testing video seekbar https://t.co/gyIZZhrh2y— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) 1553721672000

For what’s worth, this is not the first time that this feature has been spotted. Instagram apparently showed us a glimpse of it back in January last year as well. “Stumbled across the fact that you can now fast forward & rewind Instagram videos last night. Simply press & hold on the screen then move your finger. Don’t think this has been out long. #Social,” tweeted @theJBECK in January 2018.

Talking about testing new features, recently Instagram was spotted testing selector wheel format to show different filter options for ‘Stories’. The semi-circular wheel was also spotted by the same developer. “Instagram is working on new 'Stories' user-interface, inspired from mechanical circular mode switcher in DSLRs. Tabs reduced to just 'Live', 'Normal' and 'Create',"" Wong tweeted.

huawei p30 pro: Xiaomi back to 'trolling', this time it’s Huawei P30 Pro - Times of India

","
Chinese smartphone brand Xiaomi is known to troll its rivals on social media. The company, which trolled new launches from Apple and Samsung in the past, is trolling home country rival Huawei this time. Soon after the global launch of Huawei's new P-series smartphones -- P30 and P30 Pro -- the official Xiaomi global Facebook page shared two back-to-back posts trolling the new P30 phones. Xiaomi took a similar price jibe after the latest iPhone XS and XS Max were launched last year. 

In the first Facebook post, Xiaomi took a screenshot from the livestream of 
Huawei P30 Pro launch event and highlighting its prices asked, “Is this really necessary?”. 







In the second attempt, Xiaomi compared the 
Huawei P30 with the 
Mi 9 and said, “At Xiaomi, we really believe in giving you amazing products at #HonestPrices. Do you think a flagship smartphone should cost you a fortune? #Mi9.”. 







Huawei has globally launched the next-generation of its flagship P-series smartphones. As part of the 2019 lineup of P30-series smartphones, the company has launched two handsets -- Huawei P30 and Huawei P30 Pro. Both are expected to be launched in India soon. Note that Xiaomi has stopped launching flagship Mi series phones in India after the Mi 5.

The key highlight of the new Huawei P30-series is the camera, which according to the company makes the phones to have the “most advanced camera smartphones to date”. Huawei also claimed that with technologies like SuperSpectrum Sensor and extreme optical SuperZoom lens, the cameras of P30 series smartphones can rival any professional camera. 

In India, while Xiaomi leaves no stones unturned to mock and troll rivals like Samsung -- which happens to be the world’s largest mobile brand and number two in India, the company recently, claimed that the camera of its latest budget smartphone -- the 
Redmi Note 7 Pro -- is better than that of the iPhone XS/XS Max and 
OnePlus 6T.

Twitter prank: Don’t fall for this Twitter prank, it’ll lock you out of your own account - Times of India

","
If you are a Twitter user, you may have come across one of the pranks that is making rounds on the microblogging website. Apparently, it’s locking users out of their own accounts. The prank tweet suggests that if a user changes his or her birth date on Twitter to any day in 2007, it will unlock a ‘hidden’ colour scheme menu in the Twitter app. Not just access to ‘hidden’ colour scheme menu but it also claims to give users access to admin privileges and even a verified check.

However, once you change the birth date to one of the days in 2007, Twitter counts your age under 13 years and naturally, locks you out. Twitter requires a minimum age of 13 years to create an account.

The prank became so viral that Twitter Support’s official account had to tweet about the prank. “We’ve noticed a prank trying to get people to change their Twitter birthday in their profile to 2007 to unlock new color schemes. Please don’t do this. You’ll get locked out for being under 13 years old,” tweeted the account.

For those who haven’t tried this, we recommend you not to do so as it will definitely lock you out from your own account. For those who have unfortunately fallen for this prank, would have to get in touch with Twitter Support to get access back to their accounts. They would have to upload a copy of their government-issued ID.

On a related note, recently it was reported that Twitter is testing a new feature that notifies a user when someone adds a tweet in the thread. Select users will be able to use the feature by tapping on the bell icon above conversation threads. This was spotted by reverse engineer Jane Manchun in the app's Android version. She posted the screenshots on Twitter, to which the Twitter Comms official handle retweeted with a quote stating that ""This is part of our work to make Twitter more conversational.""

apple: Apple apologizes again for faulty MacBook keyboards - Times of India

","
It looks like Apple’s last year’s woes are continuing to haunt it this year as well. It has once again apologised for one of the pain points it has been having with the MacBook’s butterfly keyboard. Last year several MacBook users reported issues with the keyboard that rendered few kays as useless due to debris, dust and other elements. The iPhone-maker did try to make it up to its customers with a keyboard replacement program and even introduced new ones (third-generation) in the latest MacBook laptops. But now, it has apologised again to select users who are still facing this issue.

The apology, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, sounded something like this:

“We are aware that a small number of users are having issues with their third-generation butterfly keyboard and for that we are sorry,” stated the company. “The vast majority of Mac notebook customers are having a positive experience with the new keyboard.”

It is not now for sure how many exactly are still facing issues with the MacBook keyboard. However, the statement does confirm that it has not been addressed entirely. One such instance was reported on Twitter by the TechCrunch editor in chief, Matthew Panzarino during the recent ‘Special Event’ announcement. “I kid you not, te ""H"" key on my Macbook just started acting up. Only firing alf te time,” he tweeted while live tweeting the event.


I kid you not, te ""H"" key on my Macbook just started acting up. Only firing alf te time— Matthew Panzarino (@panzer) 1553534786000
Back in May last year, according to Apple Insider’s compiled data it was reported that the 2016 MacBook Pro’s keyboard faced twice as much failure as the old keyboards used in 2014 and 2015 MacBook Pro. It was mentioned that the 2014 MacBook Pro saw 2120 service events in the first year, of which 118 were related to keyboard issues. The 2015 models witnessed 1904 service tickets, out of which 114 were in relation to keyboards. As for the 2016 MacBook Pro, there were 1402 warranty events recorded, of which 165 were related to the keyboard (excluding Touch Bar issues).

firefox lockbox app password android: Mozilla launches Firefox Lockbox password manager app on Android - Times of India

","
Android users already have some popular apps available to keep their passwords of different accounts secure at a single place. iOS users on the other hand until now had an extra password manager app called Firefox Lockbox. Now, after approximately nine months, this app has reached Android users as well. The password management app works as intended by letting users log in to different apps with their passwords already stored in Lockbox.

Mozilla explains that Firefox Lockbox is unlike any other password manager as it gives users easy access to passwords that are already stored in their Firefox browser. “This makes Firefox Lockbox the perfect solution for people who want to secure their personal information, but may not have time (or the recall) to choose and transfer all of their passwords into a password manager,” adds the Mozilla blog post.

To access the app, one can also use Face or fingerprint unlock. Also, the Lockbox app supports autofill in apps as well so users don’t need to type passwords every time to log in to an app. “Firefox Lockbox works with autofill to make the transition from using your Firefox desktop browser to mobile seamless, by automatically filling in your passwords saved on desktop to your everyday apps like Facebook or Yelp, on your mobile device,” states the post.

The Firefox Lockbox app is already available to download from Play Store and weighs 41MB in size. Android smartphones running Android 7 Nougat and later OS versions support this app.

Adding to user data privacy and security, Mozilla few weeks ago introduced Firefox Send, an app to securely share files on the web. The platform uses end-to-end encryption and gives users the ability to chose when the file sharing link expires, number of downloads, and optional password for extra security.

‘Sidelined’ Prashant Kishor shoots off telling tweet - Times of India

","
PATNA: A tweet from star election strategist Prashant Kishor indicated all isn't well between him and JD(U), which he joined last year and was shortly after promoted to national vice-president.


Kishor tweeted on Friday he was only learning and JD(U) general secretary RCP Singh was looking after JD(U)'s entire election process. Kishor and his advocacy group IPAC have been missing in action in campaigning.

""NDA is fighting polls with all strength in Bihar under the leadership of Narendra Modi and Nitishji. JD(U) has put the responsibility of election campaigning and management on the strong shoulders of experienced leader RCP Singh. My role in the initial phase of my political career is to learn and support the party,"" tweeted Kishor, who had played a pivotal role in Bihar's grand alliance - JD(U), RJD and Congress - that won the 2015 assembly polls in Bihar and, before that, was election strategist for Narendra Modi in 2014.


बिहार में NDA माननीय मोदी जी एवं नीतीश जी के नेतृत्व में मजबूती से चुनाव लड़ रहा है। JDU की ओर से चुनाव-प्रचार एवं… https://t.co/hNF5wIXS1P— Prashant Kishor (@PrashantKishor) 1553840541000

At Kishor's joining ceremony in September, JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar told party workers he was the ""future"" of JD(U). ""Kishor had become the effective No. 2 in the party and Nitishji was even looking for a political successor in him. But the situation has changed,"" a JD(U) functionary said.

That has been apparent for a while. For instance, talking to a web portal earlier this month, Kishor said Nitish should have sought a fresh mandate after coming out of the Grand Alliance in 2017, rather than forming a new government with BJP.

Party insiders claimed such statements gave an opportunity to Kishor's critics in JD(U). ""Those from conventional political backgrounds in JD(U) never accepted Kishor. And he gave them opportunity by making such statements, campaigning for YSR Congress and meeting Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray. As a result, Kishor has been replaced as the party's No. 2 by RCP,"" a JD(U) functionary said.

While nation lauding our forces, oppn busy undermining them: PM - Times of India

","
KORAPUT: Chowkidar Sajag Aachi (chowkidar is alert), Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the crowd in Odia, while launching the BJP’s election campaign from Jeypore, in tribal-dominated Koraput district of Odisha, on Friday. Slamming his critics for belittling the achievements of the Indian Air Force, the the Prime Minister added, “While Pakistan is still counting bodies even after a month since the Balakot air strike, the opposition is busy questioning the forces.”

“The entire nation is proud of our forces and scientists, but our opposition is reluctant to acknowledge their achievements. Day and night they are engaged in undermining the achievements of our forces,” he said. 

Stating that this is a new and confident India where the right decision is taken at the right time, the Prime Minister asked the crowd whether they want a majboot (strong) government or a majboor (crippled) government.

“You should vote for a majboot government who can kill enemies at their homes and not a majboor government, who takes 10 minutes to walk 10 steps. The present India has the ability to protect its water, land and even space,” Modi said to a thunderous applause.

Citing the example of the anti-satellite missile, dubbed Mission Shakti, which was launched from a defence base off the Odisha coast on Wednesday, Modi said it has demonstrated India’s power to the world and what we are capable of. “But such achievements are appearing to be very difficult to digest for the oppositions,” he quipped. 

Modi was also critical of the Naveen Patnaik government in Odisha. “Even after ruling the state for 19 years, the BJD government has neither managed to tackle the Maoist problem nor been able to effectively pull out the state from poverty.” 

Urging the people to vote for the BJP’s candidates in both the assembly and Lok Sabha elections, the Prime Minister said Odisha development will come to Odisha only when there are BJP governments at the Centre and state.

“A double engine government is required for Odisha’s development. We want the BJP government at the Centre and state to strengthen Odisha,” said Modi who was greeted by Padma Shri Kamala Pujari on the dais.

Trying to woo the tribal voters, Modi said it is his government which increased the Centre’s budget for tribal welfare by 30 percent and has increased the minimum support price (MSP) of forest produce at least three times in the past five years. 

While only 10 forest products were enjoying the benefits of MSP, it was enhanced to 50 items to boost the tribal economy, Modi said.

“My government also created the district mineral fund (DMF) under which one percent from mining revenue will be spent on the development of tribals of the concerned region. In the past five years the state government received Rs 6,500 crore under the DMF, but owing to its inefficiency it has spent only Rs 1,000 crore till date,” Modi said, while accusing the BJD government of doing little for the development of the tribals. 

He was also critical of the state government for not allowing the Centre’s Ayushman Bharat healthcare scheme. “I want to ask you, should you not punish this government?” Modi asked, adding, “People involved in chit fund scam and protecting the mining mafias will never strengthen Odisha.” 

Listing out the work done by his government for Odisha, the Prime Minister said in the past five years eight lakh families have been provided houses under the PM Awas Yojana, 40 lakh families with LPG connections under Ujjawala scheme, 3,000 villages have been electrified and 24 lakh families are getting free power supply. Earlier, the Prime Minister paid floral tribute to tribal freedom fighter Laxman Nayak.

PM Modi: BJP will return with absolute majority - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday expressed confidence that the BJP will return to power with ""absolute majority"" after the April-May Lok Sabha election, saying the people have made up their mind to ensure victory of the National Democratic Alliance in 300-plus seats.


He also said that people have already decided in favour of the BJP and are, therefore, not searching for a ""competing face"".

In an interview to a news channel, he also said the timing of the launch of the anti-satellite missile was based on ""open space"" available to carry out the test.

""Call it an adventure or an initiative, they don't happen suddenly. You need to tell the global community that you want space at a particular time in (outer) space to ensure there is no space traffic or collision, you need to ask for an open space, you need to fix that space. It is a long process,"" he explained.

Modi rejected suggestions that the index of opposition unity is high as compared to 2014.

""If you go granular, you will find the opposition more scattered now than in 2014. Tell me, has there been any agreement in Andhra (Pradesh), (West) Bengal? Has there been any (agreement) with Communist parties? Has it happened in Kerala, Odisha,"" he said.

He also rejected possibility of opposition joining hands after elections, saying, ""Today they are leaving no stone unturned to put each other down. You look at all their statements.""

He also said that opposition joining hands post polls can happen only if people give fewer seats to him.

""When the people of this country have made up their mind to give highest number of seats to Narendra Modi, then what can happen? The results are certain. There is no doubt about that. The people of the country have decided to bring in a government that enjoys absolute majority. They have made up their mind to give NDA a mandate for a 300-plus government,"" he asserted.

Responding to a question on 'Modi Vs who' in the Lok Sabha polls, he said the question might arise in 2024. ""But there is no such chance in 2019. The people of this country have made up their mind about one side. That is why the people of the country are not in search for a competing face. Not at all.""

He said for TRP, news channels rake up such questions.

""It is important for you because...see in 2014 you had Manmohan Singh ji. You could not have gained TRP by pitting him against me. So you had to get (Arvind) Kejriwal who did not have a single MLA, a single corporator. But you had to pitch him as a future prime minister to run your shops,"" he quipped.

To a question on unemployment and the opposition's attack on the government, the PM said he is trying to make new institutions so that there is a ""perfect system"".

He pointed out that when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the prime minister, the opposition had also raised the issue of unemployment.

""After Atal ji's tenure, there were statistics that proved that there were 6 crore jobs in Atal ji's tenure. And during UPA, there were only 1.5 crore jobs and yet they maligned Atalji's government. The Lutyens' (Delhi) ecosystem kept beating the drums,"" he said.

Referring to efforts by his government to generate employment, he said four crore people have taken money from banks via the Mudra scheme.

""Four crore people have taken money for the first time. They must have started some employment, they must have employed somebody. What do I tell you? The registrations at EPFO, more than 1 crore people have registered. Money has to be given for this, it is not for free,"" he said.

The PM said more roads are being built in India today than during previous governments. ""Is manpower not required for that? Railways are growing at twice the rate, is manpower not required for that? Today, there is a huge campaign for solar energy in India. It's because of big investment. Are they saying, there's no employment because of it? What are they saying? Do they have any basis? Will they say anything they like and keep shouting,"" he shot back.

Will bring in NRC in Bengal if voted to power: Amit Shah - Times of India

","
ALIPURDUAR: BJP president Amit Shah on Friday said that his party will replicate the National Register of Citizens exercise in West Bengal if it comes to power at the Centre.


""We will bring in NRC in Bengal and throw out all infiltrators. We will ensure that Hindu refugees are not touched,"" Shah said at BJP's first Lok Sabha campaign in Bengal in Adivasi-dominated Alipurduar.

The ruling Trinamool Congress was quick to rebuff BJP Shah's claim. ""We will never allow any NRC exercise in Bengal. They (BJP) want to divide the people on religious and communal lines,"" Trinamool secretary general Partha Chatterjee said in Kolkata.

Rahul Gandhi: Our manifesto will reflect people's voice, not one man's view - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: The Congress' soon-to-be released manifesto will lay major thrust on jobs creation, addressing agrarian distress and strengthening the education and health sectors besides charting a roadmap to boost economic growth, says party president Rahul Gandhi.


He said the manifesto, being prepared after extensive nationwide consultations with key stakeholders, will reflect the people's voice and not just one man's views, an apparent reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

In an exclusive interview to PTI, the 48-year-old Congress chief said the Congress-led UPA is storming back to power as people have rejected Modi's politics of ""false promises"".

""We want India's voice and aspirations to prosper. We don't believe in one man's voice. We believe in everyone's voice and choices. It requires tremendous discipline and hard work to do, but it works,"" he said.

Congress is set to release its manifesto next week, ahead of the first phase of polling on April 11.

Without divulging specific details of the manifesto, Gandhi said it will have a well-thought out ""strategic plan"" for creation of jobs on a ""huge scale"" and a roadmap for transformation of the agriculture sector, besides ways to boost small businesses and the economy at large.

Besides promoting entrepreneurship and industry, Congress will also free businesses from the onslaught of ""tax terrorism"" besides ensuring fairness to small and medium traders, he said.

The Congress chief also said his party intends to significantly increase public investment in the education and health sectors which will help provide better facilities for the common person.

""Our manifesto has a commitment to increasing the expenditure on education and creating a high quality public education system. There is a tremendous amount of work that has gone into preparing our manifesto,"" he said.

""All this is ground breaking stuff. So yes, while the BJP's failures and Modiji's false promises and incompetence are certainly election issues, we have more than enough to share when it comes to our plans and our vision for India,"" he said.

Reflecting on his party's poor performance in the 2014 Lok Sabha poll when it just got 44 seats, Gandhi said it was an ""aberration"", asserting that the Congress is storming back to power.

""The Congress at one level is an organisation, but at another level, the Congress is a conversation.""

""It is allowing people to speak. It is allowing multiple viewpoints. It is allowing our institutions to have their own independence. It is not imposing unwitting ideas, like demonetisation on the nation,"" he said.

He said the Congress party after 2014 had got down to brass tacks - to rework, rebuild and resurrect the organisation as a whole and it was initiated by decentralising power.

The party, through effective state leadership, reconnected with workers down to the booth level, he said, adding that it has been a priority and it has been successful as evidenced in the outcome of the recent state elections.

Gandhi said the Congress across India is naturally building up and strengthening, because the ""more the RSS-BJP try to suppress the conversation, the more India wants to converse, think and grow"".

Taking a dig at Modi's 'Congress Mukt Bharat' slogan, he alleged that what the PM actually meant was that nobody should be allowed to speak or think. ""Nobody should be allowed to express themselves,"" Gandhi said.

""The Congress builds and grows in India when the conversation builds,"" said Gandhi.

Accusing Modi and the BJP/RSS of ""imposing"" their views on people, he said the Congress is not in the business of imposing ideas as it wants to listen and work together with all the stakeholders of this country.

""The RSS-BJP will say only one person speaks for India. It's impossible. As Congress president, I say with great humility that Congress will grow even more when it permits multiple different voices,"" he said.

Referring to the ambitious 'Nyay (Nyuntam Aay Yojna)' announced by him earlier this week, Gandhi claimed it threw the BJP into disarray.

""It's not my scheme; it's a scheme that has been created after listening to lakhs of people in our manifesto conversations,"" he said.

Gandhi said answers would come by talking to people on the street, as ""we're just replicating their voice"".

The Congress chief said a lot of farmers came to the party and asked for building infrastructure to help them put up a factory right near their farm, put food processing plants near agricultural areas and link those food processing units to the rest of the country.

""It's a great idea. They gave it to us, and we will implement it,"" he said.

""From my perspective, it is not only about farmers or Nyay or the youth or our women. It's also about industry, it's also about tax terrorism, it's also about fairness to small and medium businesses, it's also about entrepreneurship,"" he said.

Record haul: EC’s seizure of cash, liquor, drug hits Rs 580 crore in a day - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Progressive seizures of illegal cash, liquor, drugs and other freebies during the current election season have registered a Rs 580 crore rise in a single day, increasing to Rs 1,253 crore as on March 29 from Rs 674 crore on March 28. The exponential rise is due to Gujarat showing seizure of 100 kg of drugs/narcotics valued at Rs 500 crore in the latest report.


As per progressive seizure report last updated on Friday, the all-India seizures so far include Rs 250 crore cash, liquor worth Rs 122 crore, drugs/narcotics worth Rs 676 crore, precious metals worth Rs 183 crore and other freebies/items valued at Rs 22 crore.

The most alarming rise is in the worth of drugs seized, which was Rs 676 crore on Friday as against Rs 163 crore on Thursday. While Punjab topped the list with drugs worth Rs 92.45 crore seized till Thursday, Gujarat on Friday left it far behind with seizures valued at Rs 500 crore.

Gujarat now leads the country in terms of value of total seizures which now stands at Rs 506 crore, drugs alone account for 98.6 per cent of the total value of seizures.

Gujarat is followed by Tamil Nadu with seizures valued at Rs 153 crore, Andhra Pradesh at Rs 143 crore, UP at Rs 120 crore and Punjab at Rs 117 crore.

Bhumiputras jostle for space in Darjeeling - Times of India

","
DARJEELING/KOLKATA: As many as eight 'bhumiputras' (sons of the soil) are in the fray in Darjeeling Lok Sabha constituency which was last represented by outsiders Jaswant Singh and SS Ahluwalia of BJP. The presence of so many candidates with Gorkha roots, with some openly swearing by the Gorkhaland cause, has left the Hills divided, with no party entitled to a local edge.


Amar Singh Rai, MLA of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (Binay Tamang faction), is a 'bhumiputra' fighting on a Trinamool ticket. Strange bedfellows till the other day, GJM (Bimal Gurung) and Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) have thrown their weight behind BJP candidate Raju Singh Bista, a Manipurborn Gorkha businessman.

Former Kalimpong MLA Harka Bahadur Chhetri is also a son of the soil. So are CPM's Saman Pathak, a former Rajya Sabha member, and Congress' Sankar Malakar, MLA from Matigara-Naxalbari. Also in the race are independents Reseeka Chhetri, Ajay Dahal and Indian Democratic Republican Front's Christopher Gahatraj.

Two others - CPRM's RB Rai and former GJM spokesperson Swaraj Thapa - have pulled out of the fray.

The ground situation indicates identity politics won't work for any single candidate this time. Some young voters have taken to social media to call for a NOTA vote while workers in seven tea gardens have announced a boycott.

Friction ends, RJD-led alliance names candidates for 31 seats - Times of India

","
PATNA: Grand Alliance in Bihar announced the allocation of 31 Lok Sabha seats among its partners on Friday, putting an end to the ongoing friction between RJD and Congress.


While RJD chief Lalu Prasad's daughter Misa Bharti will contest from Patliputra, Patna Sahib has been allocated to Congress, paving the way for sitting MP and BJP rebel Shatrughan Sinha to contest against Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad. However, Kirti Azad, the sitting BJP MP from Darbhanga who joined Congress recently, could not be allocated the seat of his choice as the same has been given to RJD. There is no clarity whether he will agree to shift to Valmikinagar, one of the nine seats allocated to Congress, if the same is offered to him.

Among the Congress candidates whose names were announced at a joint press conference of GA partners are former Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar (Sasaram-SC) and Tariq Anwar (Katihar).

Much against the wishes of Lalu's elder son Tej Pratap, the latter's father-in-law, Chandrika Rai, will be RJD candidate from Saran. Tej's divorce petition against wife Aishwarya Rai is pending in a Patna family court.

Among other prominent RJD candidates are former Union ministers Sharad Yadav (Madhepura), Raghuvansh Prasad Singh (Vaishali) and Jay Prakash Narayan Yadav (Banka); former Bihar ministers Jagdanand Singh (Buxar) and Abdul Bari Siddiqui (Darbhanga) and jailed don and murder convict Shahabuddin's wife Hena Shahab (Siwan). RJD leader Tejashwi did not announce candidates for eight of the 31 seats, though they have been given to alliance partners.

Tejashwi said RJD has left Ara from its quota for CPI(ML) as a ""gesture of goodwill because the party (CPI-ML) always fights for the cause of poor"". He said RLSP candidates would be later announced by its national president Upendra Kushwaha, who was not present due to his preoccupation at a district court.

PM Modi protects rich, Congress bats for the poor, weaker sections: Rahul Gandhi - Times of India

","
YAMUNANAGAR: Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday launched a sharp attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying he protects the rich while his own party bats for the poor, the weaker sections and the farmers.


""The 2019 polls are a fight between two ideologies. On one hand are the BJP, the RSS and Narendra Modi and on the other is the Congress,"" he said.

Gandhi is on a day's visit to Haryana to be part of Congress state unit's ongoing ""Parivartan Yatra"".

He was scheduled to address a series of meetings.

""During the past five years, Modi has made several promises to the people of this country. Wherever he goes, he spreads hatred,"" Gandhi said.

""He promised putting Rs 15 lakh into every Indian's bank account. Did anyone get anything?"" he said at a public meeting in Yamunanagar district's Jagadhri town.

He said unlike the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Congress keeps its promises.

Gandhi recalled the recent Congress announcement on NYAY, a minimum income guarantee scheme, that it plans to introduce if it forms the government.

The Congress leader claimed the prime minister waived loans worth Rs 3.5 lakh crore of 15 industrialists. ""Modi protects the rich,"" he said.

But the Congress works for the farmers, the weaker sections and the poor, he said.

Hardik Patel's poll hopes diminish as HC rejects plea to stay conviction - Times of India

","
AHMEDABAD: Patidar leader Hardik Patel's hopes of fighting the upcoming Lok Sabha elections hit a roadblock on Friday with the Gujarat high court dismissing his plea to stay his conviction in a rioting case.


Ahead of joining the Congress, Patel had moved the high court seeking a stay on his conviction by a Visnagar court in July 2018. He told the court that he had a chance to win the election but the conviction hampered his participation in electoral politics under provisions of the Representation of People Act.

The state government strongly opposed Patel’s petition in the court, claiming that he has a habit of instigating people to cause violence. 

The state cited Patel’s “criminal antecedent” by listing 24 FIRs registered against him and submitted that he has led people to indulge in violence on several occasions in the past. It said that if Patel really wants to serve the people, there is no need to contest elections. 

After hearing the arguments, Justice A G Uraizee rejected Patel’s application.

Patel approached the HC on March 8 for a stay on his conviction. Justice R P Dholaria recused himself from hearing the case. The Gujarat government sought adjournment on two occasions with Patel complaining that the state is deliberating causing a delay so that the time of filing nominations gets over.

The Patidar leader welcomed the court's verdict but asked why a 25-year-old leader is being stopped from contesting the elections. ""Several BJP leaders have cases against them. Some of them have even been convicted. But the law only applies to us,"" he said on Twitter.

Hardik said he will continue to raise his voice against truth, non-violence and honesty. ""I will continue to campaign for the Congress in Gujarat and across the country. My only mistake is that I did not bow down to the BJP. This is the result of fighting against those who are in power,"" he said.

In July last year, the sessions court at Visnagar in Mehsana district sentenced Patel to two years of imprisonment for rioting and arson in Visnagar town in 2015 during the Patidar quota stir.

In August last year, the high court suspended the lower court's order sentencing him to two years' jail term in the 2015 rioting case, but did not stay his conviction.

With the April 4 being the last day of filing of nominations in Gujarat, Patel has less than a week to clear the legal hurdle to be able to contest. His advocates said that they would soon move the apex court.

Narendra Modi in Telangana: Vote for New Bharat, says Modi in Telangana; enlists NDA's achievements - Times of India

","
MAHBUBNAGAR (TELANGANA): Asking the people of Telangana to vote for a ""new Bharat"" where the people of the state will also benefit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Friday said the citizens in the country were moving forward sans any fear as the 'chowkidar' has been 'alert.'


Addressing a mammoth public rally here, Modi took a swipe at chief minister K Chandrasekar Rao for the delay in forming the cabinet after securing a massive win last year, saying the latter must have been influenced by some astrologer.

Rao is said to be a firm believer in rituals and astrology.

The Prime Minister described Rao as the ""face"" of dynastic and appeasement politics.

In his first rally here post the announcement of the Lok Sabha polls, Modi said despite abuses and attacks against him, he has steadfastly moved ahead with his development agenda due to the 'blessings' of the people.

""Your blessings allowed me to tolerate all kinds of pressures. That's why I could run a decision-making government,"" he said.

He assserted the NDA government during the last five has left no stone unturned to ensure women's safety and farmers' security, among other things.

The Prime Minister said he was working hard in areas ranging from civic amenities to space, an obvious reference to the country successfully experimenting 'Mission Shakti,' after an 'Anti-Sat' (A-Sat) missile had shot down a low earth orbit satellite, putting the country into an elite club.

""On April 11, you are not just going to select an MP or vote for a Prime Minister, but will be voting for a new India, which will be reflective of the aspirations of Telangana,"" Modi added.

Further, the country's security had improved as bomb blasts were now virtually ""confined to only some parts of Kashmir,"" while there have been no terror attacks in other parts, he said.

Globe-trotter Modi flew to Pakistan to have biryani, says Priyanka Gandhi - Times of India

","
AYODHYA: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi on her maiden visit to Ayodhya launched a direct attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying he went globetrotting, but never visited a village in his constituency, Varanasi, in his five years in power.Blunting the nationalistic rhetoric of BJP, she accused Modi of “going to Pakistan for biryani”. “
Pakistan biryani khaane toh woh gaye tha na,” she retorted, in a reference to Modi’s trip to Lahore on December 25, 2015, which was followed by fidayeen attack on Pathankot air base a week later.


Priyanka, who was on a three-day Awadh region tour — Amethi, Rae Bareli & Ayodhya — to give a leg-up to Congress ahead of Lok Sabha polls, was replying to a query outside an Ayodhya school on the BJP charge that Pakistan would celebrate if Congress won the 2019 poll.

Earlier, addressing a gathering in Ayodhya’s Adilpur, she took swipes on Modi’s hug diplomacy while meeting foreign leaders. “
Woh America, Japan, China, sab jagah gaye poori duniya mai. Par aapse kisi se na mile (He toured the world, but didn’t come to meet you),” she said“The PM didn't have the time to meet his own constituents. It shows this government's intention. It only focuses on the rich,” she said. 

She also broke her silence on Nyuntam Aay Yojana (NYAY), saying NDA government initially reaped benefits of UPA’s flagship project, MNREGA, but stopped implementing it when they saw credit going to Congress.

 “They wrote off more than 3.7 lakh crore off bad loans. I want to first ask them how it was achieved,” she asked.

Continuing her tirade, she said, “Before the 2014 Lok Sabha election, they said they will give jobs to two crore people every year. Wherever I go, wherever my car stops, I can’t find a youth who is employed. Also, BJP said they will put Rs 15 lakh into people's accounts. Now, when the election is around the corner, they have started sending Rs 2,000.”

With JD(S) on its side, Congress looks to widen the gap - Times of India

","
The Raichur LS seat in one of the most backward regions of Karnataka is being fancied by two major contenders, given the fact that the Congress scraped through by a wafer thin margin in the 2014 polls.


BV Nayak of Congress had polled just 1,499 votes more than his closet rival A Shivanagouda Nayak from the BJP in the ST reserved seat. Raichur was third after Ladakh (36 votes) and Mahasamund (1,217) in Chhattisgarh among seats with the thinnest victory margins.


""With both Congress and BJP aware that it can be anybody's game, they will go all-out and make the poll scene engrossing,"" said Chamarasa Mali Patil, a veteran farmers' leader from Raichur district.

Janata Dal (Secular), which has joined hands with Congress, holds the key to this constituency this time as its candidate had bagged more than 2% of the votes last time, when the difference between the winner and runner-up was just 0.15% of the votes. Nayak had polled 4,43,659 votes against Shivanagouda's 4,42,160 votes. D B Nayak of JD(S) had bagged 21,706 votes.

But a lot depends on how far Congress is successful in getting its alliance partner's votes transferred to itself. If simple math prevails, it should give Congress an edge over BJP. ""We have no doubt that JD(S) supporters are backing Congress as the cadres of both parties are getting along well,"" said Ramanna Hirabagera, Raichur district Congress president.

""Apart from JD(S) support, Congress is expected to improve its tally on its own considering the goodwill our MP has gained in the last five years and the failure of the Narendra Modi-led NDA in keeping promises,"" he added.

Seeking an early mover advantage, Congress has swiftly decided to re-nominate B V Nayak as its candidate, while BJP is weighing its options. Former state minister Amaresh Nayak and ex-MLA Thipparaju are among the saffron party's ticket aspirants.

""We see the Modi wave has only grown stronger and have no doubt we will wrest the seat from Congress. Our cadres have already hit the ground,"" said Halappa Achar, BJP MLA and in-charge of Raichur LS constituency.

Raichur voters have backed BJP only once, in 2009, when B Sriramulu, who is popular among ST communities, led the campaign and helped his relative Sanna Pakkirappa win the seat. Else, Congress has won the seat, barring one term in 1996, when the JD(S) bagged it.

Rahul Gandhi does not rule out contesting from second seat, says party will take a call - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Congress president Rahul Gandhi has not ruled out contesting the Lok Sabha election from a constituency other than Amethi, saying many party leaders have fought elections from more than one seat in the past and a decision on the issue will be taken by the party soon.


Referring to demands from party leaders that his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra should contest, Gandhi told PTI in an interview that she will have to take a call on whether to fight the polls or not.

Speculation about the newly appointed Congress general secretary contesting grew after she asked people in Varanasi on Thursday whether she should fight the polls from the temple town, the constituency from where Prime Minister Narendra Modi will seek a re-election.

Amethi is his ""karmabhoomi"" (place where you are destined to work) and will remain so, Rahul Gandhi said, keeping his options open on fighting the election from a second seat amid demands from party units in Kerala and Karnataka that he should be fielded from their states.

""Amethi is my 'karmabhoomi' and shall always remain so. I am deeply grateful for the love, affection and the sentiments expressed by our party workers in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala who have asked me to contest on a second seat from their states,"" the Congress chief told PTI in response to a question on the speculation over him contesting from Wayanad in Kerala.

""In the past too, many leaders from the Congress and other parties, including Mr Modi himself, have contested elections from more than one seat. The Congress party will take a decision on this issue at the earliest,"" he said.

In 2014, Rahul Gandhi defeated BJP's Smriti Irani by a margin of over one lakh votes. Both are pitted against each other again from Amethi.

Asked about Priyanka Gandhi contesting the election, the Congress chief said candidate selection is an ongoing process and the party has announced over 300 candidates so far.

""As far as Priyanka is concerned, it is up to her to decide if she wants to contest the election or not,"" he said.

On whether party veterans will be fielded by the Congress to put up a strong fight, Gandhi said the party has a system of identifying candidates and it goes through various processes.

""I have looked at young as well as experienced candidates equally because I have believed that Congress party needs both. Seniors are fighting elections. We also have many new faces who will be fighting their first election,"" he said.

There has been a clamour among Congress leaders from the south for Rahul Gandhi to contest from Kerala as well as Karnataka and the state units have already passed resolutions on the issue.

His mother, former Congress president Sonia Gandhi, earlier contested from the Bellary Lok Sabha seat in Karnataka while his grandmother, former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, had contested from Chikamangalur in Karnataka.

The process of nominations in Kerala, which goes to the polls on April 23, started on Thursday and will end on April 4.

AAP needs alliance in Haryana not Delhi: Kejriwal - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said his party needs an alliance with the Congress in Haryana, but not in Delhi, for the Lok Sabha elections.

Speaking to a TV channel on the sidelines of an election rally in Vijaywada, Kejriwal said the party is capable of winning all seven seats in Delhi on its own.

""It is in Haryana that we need the support of the Congress. I don't understand why they are not forming an alliance with us in Haryana,"" Kejriwal told NDTV.

He also held a meeting with Punjab party workers in Delhi and asked them to dispel any rumours related to alliance with the Congress.

According to sources, the AAP wanted to contest on three seats in Punjab, two in Haryana and five in Delhi.

But due to looming uncertainty, the AAP announced all seven candidates in Delhi, eight in Punjab and is waiting for a response from the Congress over an alliance in Haryana.

On March 13, the Delhi chief minister had appealed to the Congress to join the proposed alliance between his party and the Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) but his offer was snubbed by his Haryana-ally, which said it can ""never have any truck"" with the Congress.

Kejriwal had said that an alliance between the AAP, the Congress and the Jannayak Janata Party would defeat the BJP in the state.

LUCKNOW: Eastern UP, the region that will play a key role in the numbers game for the next Lok Sabha, will see a triangular contest as Yogi Adityanath, Akhilesh Yadav and Priyanka Gandhi slug it out.


For Akhilesh, who is contesting from Azamgarh, it's a maiden foray into the region, which accounts for 35 Lok Sabha seats. BJP dominated the region in both the 2014 Lok Sabha election and the 2017 assembly polls. In 2014, it won 32 of the 35 Lok Sabha seats here.

Akhilesh's father and SP founder Mulayam Singh Yadav had won Azamgarh by 60,000 votes against BJP's Ramakant Yadav in 2014, when BJP had swept the region riding the Modi wave. BJP is yet to announce its nominee, but speculation is rife that Bhojpuri film star Dinesh Lal Yadav aka Nirahua, who joined BJP on Thursday, may take on the SP chief.



Lok Sabha elections: How BJP beats Congress in turning votes into seatsAnalysis of election data from 1996-2009, including the two terms of UPA, shows that the strike rate of BJP contestants was far better than those fielded by Congress. That Cong also fielded more candidates than BJP could have affected its winning percentage, but experts explain, ""BJP's success in building a national narrative had been in the pipeline since 1992"".


Azamgarh has a large Yadav and Muslim population, so the caste arithmetic favours Akhilesh. Nirahua is from neighbouring Ghazipur and BJP hopes to exploit his star power among Bhojpuri speaking population.

Eastern UP comprises the most densely populated areas and has been historically crippled by poverty and backwardness. Human development indicators of the region have been worse than even drought-prone Bundelkhand.

Out of 21 CMs since Independence, including Yogi, nine belonged to this region, yet it lags in employment, industrial development, infrastructure, investment and agriculture. Under Yogi, state machinery has shifted focus to the eastern region but it is yet to show tangible impact.


 After the decline of Congress in the late 1980s, BJP gradually captured eastern UP, drawing strength from the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and three seats of religious power - Ram temple in Ayodhya, Gorakhnath temple in Gorakhpur, which is Yogi's home ground, and Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi. But the rise of SP and BSP after their 1993 alliance dealt a blow to saffron power.

The regional allies dominated the region for more than a decade when BJP was reduced to 10 seats in the 2004 and 2009 Lok Sabha polls. However, in 2014, BJP turned the caste mathematics upside down, winning a large chunk of OBCs from SP and non-Jatav Dalits from BSP.

The onus, therefore, is on Akhilesh to revive the alliance. By tying up with BSP and snatching away Yogi's bastion Gorakhpur in a bypoll, he showed it's possible. In eastern UP, he has entered alliances with smaller outfits, such as Nirbal Indian Shoshit Hamara Aam Dal (Nishad) Party. The latter comprises primarily Mallahs (boatmen community), who wield considerable influence in Gorakhpur, Bhadohi and neighbouring areas. In the Gorakhpur bypoll, SP loaned its candidate from Nishad - Praveen Nishad, who won. He is likely to be re-nominated.

BJP is banking on Modi and Yogi and their development plank in Varanasi and Gorakhpur. Since 2014, Modi has rolled out development projects to the tune of Rs 2 lakh crore in Varanasi. Yogi, after becoming CM, has followed Modi's development model in Gorakhpur.

Congress has had a late start. After its attempts to join the grand alliance failed, Rahul Gandhi deployed his sister Priyanka with the objective of reviving the party in east UP. Her Ganga yatra from Allahabad to Varanasihas enthused the cadre and filled a leadership vacuum. But the Congress vote can cut both ways. If it win over Muslims, it will dent SP-BSP. If upper castes gravitate towards it, BJP will be in trouble.

'Mahagathbandhan' in Bihar allocates seats for alliance partners for Lok Sabha poll phases 3 to 7 - Times of India

","
PATNA: The 'mahagathbandhan' (grand alliance) in Bihar on Friday announced the seats to be contested by each of the alliance partners - the RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM and VIP - in phases three to seven of the general elections.


Out of the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar, polling would be held in 31 constituencies in phases three to seven between April 23 and May 19.

Announcing the seat-sharing arrangement at a press conference here, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav also declared the names of his party's candidates and said that no nominee would be fielded by the alliance in Ara to help the CPI - ML Liberation. He said the candidate for Sheohar seat ""will be decided in two-three days"".

Senior leaders of the Congress were conspicuous by their absence at the press conference.

Yadav also said, his party would contest the Darbhanga seat, which has emerged as a bone of contention between the RJD and the Congress with the latter insisting on having the seat as it wanted to field sitting MP Kirti Azad, who had recently joined the party after quitting the BJP.

Senior RJD leader Abdul Bari Siddiqui would fight from Darbhanga.

Among the other prominent RJD candidates, Lalu Prasad's eldest daughter Misa Bharti would contest from Pataliputra, which she had lost to her father's former loyalist-turned-BJP leader Ram Kripal Yadav in 2014. Chandrika Rai the father of Tej Pratap Yadav's estranged wife Aishwarya, will fight from Saran.

Tejashwi also claimed that the Congress, which was represented at the press conference by former MLC Narendra Kumar Singh, had cleared the names of some of its candidates which included sitting MP from Supaul Ranjeet Ranjan and former Lok Sabha speaker Meira Kumar who would try her luck from Sasaram.

Meira Kumar has been contesting from her Sasaram parliamentary constituency for many years but had lost in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.

Bhojpuri cinema’s Big 3 take leading roles in BJP - Times of India

","
VARANASI: Not long ago, they were to Bhojpuri cinema what the Khans - Shah Rukh, Salman and Aamir - are to Bollywood. Manoj Tiwary, Ravi Kishan and Dinesh Lal Yadav 'Nirahua' were the three biggies who ruled Bhojwood. And with 'Nirahua' joining BJP in Lucknow on Wednesday, the three musketeers who helped the regional film industry survive and thrive are now part of the saffron glamour brigade. This is Bhojpuri cinema's biggest moment in the political spotlight.


Their roles in the coming Lok Sabha election will be decided in the next few days. But at the moment, all three are expected to fight for a seat in the Lower House.

""I was asked to contest by UP CM Yogi Adityanath. I am ready,"" Nirahua told a news channel. Told he might be asked to face Akhilesh Yadav in Azamgarh, the actor said, ""Yeh to bahut achha hoga (That would be great). My home is in nearby Ghazipur.""

Fellow actor Ravi Kishan, who had finished a disappointing sixth on a Congress ticket from Jaunpur in 2014, is hoping to find success with BJP. ""I will fight either from Jaunpur or Gorakhpur depending on what is decided by the party. I am inspired by PM Narendra Modi to give back to my community,"" the 49-year-old actor told TOI over the phone.

He isn't the only one to switch channels. Tiwary was a Samajwadi Party candidate for Gorakhpur in 2009. He had finished third. The singeractor, whose Mumbai office was attacked by MNS activists in 2008, won North-East Delhi in 2014, his likely seat again. A star campaigner during the Bihar state polls in 2015, he is now also the Delhi BJP president, a sure sign of the capital's changed demographics.

Both Kishan and Tiwary are Brahmins. Nirahua is a Yadav, the first OBC to become a major male star in Bhojpuri cinema. He started what could be loosely termed 'Mandalisation' in the regional cinema. Bhojpuri film stars of the previous generation were either Rajputs (Sujit Kumar) or Brahmins (Rakesh Pandey). Now, there are others OBC stars such as Khesarilal Yadav.

The trio comes from the Poorvanchal area. The son of a well-heeled farmer, Tiwary grew up in Varanasi although his family roots go back to Bihar's Bhabhua district. A medium pacer who had played in the Vizzy Trophy, he took to music professionally after failing to make headway as a cricketer. Kishan is the son of a priest from Jaunpur district. Karate-kid Nirahua was born in Kolkata where his father was a factory worker. Unlike Kishan, both Nirahua and Tiwary are singer-actors. Nirahua took to stage at an early age and soon became a paisa vasool performer in east UP, Bihar and later even in Fiji.

Tiwary's 'Sasura Bada Paisewala' revived the ailing Bhojpuri film industry in 2004. Kishan's 'Panditji Batain Na Biyaah Kab Hoi' proved the success was no flash in the pan. Interestingly, Nagma, one of the two heroines in the film, later contested on a Congress ticket from Meerut in 2014, finishing fourth.

Nirahua's 'Nirahua Rickshawala' (2007) and 'Nirahua Chalal Sasural' (2008) were box-office hits. The first featured a long, fiery kiss that was endlessly discussed. Their combined success elevated Bhojpuri films from a cottage industry to a regular film industry that produced 50-70 films a year. In 2017, another singer-actor, Pawan Singh ('Lolipop Lagelu') too had joined BJP.

But opponents aren't looking too impressed with Congress's Ajay Rai saying taking help from the glamour brigade while ignoring local politicians will demotivate a cadre-based party like BJP. BJP's Nagendra Raghuvanshi countered this by saying that ""these artistes are impressed by PM Modi's leadership. Their joining BJP proves that our popularity is growing"".

Congress may promise law to curb mob violence, lynchings - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: In a significant initiative, Congress is likely to promise a new law against hate crimes, a likely omnibus measure to deter lynchings, in its 2019 election manifesto.


The party, it is learnt, has veered towards a clear commitment to curb mob violence and lynchings. The Congress has accused BJP of encouraging attacks by mobs, particularly cow vigilantes which has seen several civil society groups criticise the Modi government.

Sources said the carefully crafted manifesto promise would be limited to stating that if voted to power, a Congress government would institute a special law to deal with crimes of hate/mob violence. The party is likely to tread carefully, having itself adopted the ""gau raksha"" theme in recent state elections.

Special laws, with provisions of stringent punishment and fast-track courts, have long been identified as sources of deterrent.

The manifesto will steer clear of mentioning cow-lynchings, the single most controversial type of mob violence, and the inspiration behind the Congress poll promise appears to be multi-dimensional.

Sources said hate crimes are of communal nature but are also triggered by anti-caste feelings, moral policing and rumours. The last category is important in view of lynchings provoked by fake news on WhatsApp and Facebook about child lifters being on the prowl in a village or town.

Either way, the election promise for an anti-hate law would be the Congress way of making an ideological statement in its clash with BJP for the national sweepstakes.

Ever since they hit the headlines post-Akhlaq killing in Dadri village in western Uttar Pradesh, lynchings have come to be identified with cows. Most of its victims have been Muslims though Dalits too have been targeted in many cases.

As incidents continued, the BJP-led Centre and states came under severe criticism for not doing enough to check vigilantism. It led to widespread allegations that lynchings had become a political tool to effect religious polarisation. Even PM Modi too had in a public function asked CMs to crack down on cow vigilantes.

While most of the mob killings like Akhlaq and Pehlu Khan were about beef and cows, Junaid Khan was thrown out of a train in Palwal in Haryana by a group of men in what was reported to be a communal incident.

In this specific context, anti-Dalit crimes came to national notice with Una floggings in Gujarat when seven members of a Dalit family were targeted for skinning a dead cow. The perpetrators recorded the atrocities in a video which went viral and triggered national outrage.

By general reckoning, ""hate crimes"" largely constitute crimes against religious minorities. In a way, it may be a repeat of the ""anti-communal violence bill"" which the UPA government had promised and attempted to craft but without success over its definition of a victim as being a member of a minority group only.

The biggest hurdle in such cases is that ""law and order"" is a ""state subject"" and the states are loathe to allow any interference on their domain.

Mumbai North: Urmila Matondkar latest Bollywood figure fielded by Congress - Times of India

","
MUMBAI: Bollywood actor Urmila Matondkar, who joined the Congress this week, is the latest Bollywood figure fielded by the party from the Mumbai North Lok Sabha constituency, a BJP stronghold.


Matondkar is pitted against BJP MP Gopal Shetty, who defeated former Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam in the 2014 Lok Sabha poll.

Matondkar, who has appeared in popular Hindi films like ""Rangeela"" and ""Satya"" and in the critically-acclaimed ""Masoom"" as a child artiste, will make her electoral debut with the April 29 poll in that constituency.

In the past, the Congress had fielded Bollywood actor Govinda from the Mumbai North seat, which he won.

According to sources in the Congress, the party was looking for a known face to take on Shetty, perceived as being a strong candidate.

The search ended with Matondkar, the source added.

""Some celebrities recently got associated with the party. Matondkar happens to be the most popular name among them,"" the source said.

BJP leader Ram Naik, currently the governor of Uttar Pradesh, had represented the constituency between 1989 and 1999.

Naik's winning streak came to an end in 2004, when actor Govinda defeated him.

Govinda didn't fight the 2009 election, which was successfully contested by Nirupam.

The Congress has also announced its candidates in four other Mumbai seats — Mumbai northwest (Nirupam), Mumbai north-central (Priya Dutt), Mumbai south (Milind Deora) and Mumbai south-central (Eknath Gaikwad).

The Congress has shared the Mumbai North East seat with its grand alliance partner, the NCP.

Hit by the Narendra Modi wave in the last election, the Congress could secure only two seats in Maharashtra in the 2014 general election, failing to win any of the five seats it contested in Mumbai.

All the Lok Sabha seats in Mumbai will go to polls on April 29.

As part of its seat-sharing arrangement with the NCP and other parties, the Congress is contesting 24 seats of the total 48 constituencies in the state.

It has so far declared 23 candidates in Maharashtra and is yet to name a candidate from the Pune constituency.

The NCP will field candidates in 20 of the seats in the state.

The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana led by MP Raju Shetti will contest two seats, while the Bahujan Vikas Aghadi and Yuva Swabhiman Paksh will contest a seat each.

Four out of nine Congress nominees in Bihar likely to be 'borrowed players' - Times of India

","
Once famous for bagging up to 90 per cent of Lok Sabha seats in undivided Bihar, Congress in this election depends on 'borrowed players' as four of its total nine candidates in the state may be 'turncoats'. Among the 'turncoats', the names of two have already been announced on Friday. They are former NCP leader Tariq Anwar (Katihar) and former BJP MP Uday Singh alias Pappu Singh (Purnia). 


Though Congress has not yet announced candidates for Patna Sahib and Valmikinagar, in all likelihood the seats will be contested by sitting BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha, who will be joining Congress on April 6, and former saffron party leader Kirti Azad, respectively. If Shatru and Kirti actually contest from Patna Sahib and Valmikinagar on Congress ticket, respectively, four of the grand old party's nine candidates in Bihar would be 'borrowed players'.

Congress first family won't be back in power: PM Modi - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Expressing confidence that BJP will improve on its 2014 Lok Sabha performance, PM Narendra Modi said on Friday that the ""first family"" of Congress will never return to power even as he accused the party of rampant corruption and non-performance when it held office for decades.


""
Ab yeh parivar Hindustan ke raj singhasan mein baithne wale nahi hain (This family is not going to sit on the throne of power in India),"" the PM said in an interview to a private TV channel. Modi said BJP will retain its ""absolute majority"", saying people had made up their minds to ensure NDA's win in over 300 seats. He also said people had decided in favour of BJP and were not searching for a ""competing face"".

When the people of this country have made up their minds to give the highest number of seats to Narendra Modi, then what can happen? The results are certain. There is no doubt about that... They have made up their minds to give NDA a mandate for a 300+ government,"" he asserted, ruling out any post-poll opposition coalition.

He said India's ""satellite killer"" missile test was not a random event. ""Call it an adventure or an initiative, it doesn't happen suddenly. You need to tell the global community that you want space at a particular time... to ensure there is no space traffic or collision (in outer space), you need to ask for open space, you need to fix that space. It is a long process,"" the PM said. ""If you go granular, you will find the opposition more scattered than in 2014. Tell me, has there been any agreement in Andhra, Bengal? Has there been any (agreement) with Communist parties? "" he asked.

Prashant Kishor: My role is to learn and cooperate

","
PATNA: Apparently hurt for not being given any strategic position for the Lok Sabha elections in Bihar, JD(U) national vice-president Prashant Kishor on Friday said that it was just the beginning of his political career and his ""role was to learn and to cooperate"".


The former poll strategist, who was inducted into the party by its national president and chief minister Nitish Kumar in September, took to Twitter to speak his mind.

""The NDA is fighting strongly in Bihar under the leadership of Modi and Nitish. On part of the JD(U), the responsibilities of poll management and campaign are on the broad shoulders of senior and experienced leader RCP Singh. In this initial stage of my political career, my role is to learn and to cooperate,"" Kishor tweeted in Hindi.

Although Kishor had been made part of a three-member team - also comprising party general secretary and chief spokesman K C Tyagi - for exploring possibilities of the JD(U)'s expansion beyond Bihar and his name figures in the list of star campaigners in the state for the first phase, speculations have been rife that there has been a diminution in his clout.

Kishor, whose meteoric rise from a primary member to the party's vice-president was viewed in some circles as a move by the chief minister to rebuff national general secretary RCP Singh, recently ruffled many feathers with his candid take on Kumar's exit from the 'Mahagathbandhan' (grand alliance) and return to NDA in 2017.

In an interview to a news portal, Kishor had said that while he found no fault with the decision, which was apparently taken ""in the interests of Bihar"", he did not agree with the ""method"" and that ""ideally Nitish Kumar should have sought a fresh mandate"".

Kumar had resigned in July, 2017, disapproving of the corruption cases lodged against his then deputy and Lalu Prasad's younger son Tejashwi Yadav and the RJD's firm refusal to demands that the deputy CM put in his papers.

Within less than 24 hours, however, he formed a new government with the BJP - his old ally with which he had snapped ties in 2013 following differences over projection of Narendra Modi as the prime ministerial candidate.

Kishor's candour did not go down well with many party cadres, some of whom openly criticized him for making such statements. There have been reports that he had also left Kumar, unwittingly, uncomfortable.

A former poll strategist, who handled Modi's successful campaign of 2014, Kishor came close to Kumar when the Bihar CM hired him for devising strategies for the Mahagathbandhan in the 2015 assembly polls.

The short-lived alliance that came into being with Kumar and Prasad burying the hatchet and the Congress also coming on board, trounced the NDA and halted the BJP juggernaut in Bihar.

Present method of counting VVPAT slips most suitable, EC tells SC - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Friday asserted in the Supreme Court that 21 opposition leaders have been unable to raise any ground for altering the existing system of random counting of the VVPAT slips from one polling booth per assembly segment which was ""found to be most suitable"" after due studies and tests.


EC sought dismissal of their petition seeking that VVPAT slips of at least 50 per cent of voting machines in each assembly constituency be checked randomly in the Lok Sabha elections next month.

""Any further increase in the sample size of verification will lead to very negligible gain in the confidence level, which currently is way above 99.9936 per cent,"" the poll panel said.

It said issues raised by them have already been considered, studied and determined and the decision has been taken to conduct the present elections by adopting the prevalent system of counting of VVPAT slips.

The EC, asked on March 25 by the apex court to give its view on increasing the number of random sample surveys from one booth per assembly segment, said that in the future elections it may consider suggestions for further improving the holding of polls in free and fair manner.

""It is submitted that with the imminent elections issues raised in the instant petitions are matters that have already been considered, studied and determined by the Election Commission of India and have since culminated in adopting the course of conduct of the imminent election in the present manner,"" the EC said in its affidavit.

It said the writ petition filed by 21 opposition leaders, led by Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu, ""does not raise any ground or base for altering the existing system at this juncture and it is accordingly prayed that the present system as decided to be adopted for the imminent elections be continued with and the petition dismissed. ""

The poll panel maintained that it is always open to bringing about any improvements that would further the cause of free and fair elections,.

""In so far as the grievances and reliefs prayed for in the instant writ petitions are concerned, these are all matters to which the Election Commission of India has applied itself, and after due studies and tests has arrived at the conclusion that the method as presently adopted has been found to be most suitable,"" the affidavit said.

The poll panel said If at all with regard to future elections, any other suggestions that have not been considered are brought up, it would immediately look into the same in order to consider their efficacy and utility to the ultimate objective of conducting free and fair polls.

The poll panel currently adopts a system of counting of VVPAT slips in one polling booth per assembly constituency in the Vidhan Sabha polls and in one polling booth in each assembly segment for the Lok Sabha polls.

The affidavit said that the 21 opposition leaders have not disclose ""even one specific instance for this Court to come to a conclusion that the existing system would in any manner adversely influence the free and fair elections.""

Further, the poll panel said the petition by them does not raise any new or different apprehension or grievance as was raised in the earlier cases, nor brings out any grave or serious reason requiring a revamping of the system that has been adopted for the purpose of the conduct of the 2019 elections.

""It is further submitted that when the polls are imminent and polling is to commence from April 11, 2019, to now seek to alter the system adopted by the Election Commission of India at this stage might not be feasible,"" the affidavit said.

In addition, the poll panel, which opposed the petition of 21 opposition leaders, said 50 per cent VVPAT slip verification in each assembly segment of a Parliamentary Constituency or Assembly Constituency on an average shall enlarge the time required for counting to about six days.

""It is also relevant to mention that in many Assembly Constituencies, there are more than 400 polling stations, which will require about 8-9 days to complete the VVPAT slip count. It is pertinent to mention that demands for re-count that routinely arise of the VVPAT slips themselves, which will compound the time requirement,"" the affidavit said.

It further said that increased VVPAT slip counting will require extensive training and capacity building of election officials in the field and substantial increase of such officials will be required for deployment in the field.

Aware Adivasis move from block to tactical voting - Times of India

","
BHOPAL: Unlike around 15-20 years ago, wooing tribal voters has become difficult these days as they do not cast block votes for any party due to increasing awareness among them.

Tribals are now trying to assert their identity and it is due to this awareness that the Gondvana Gantantra Party (GGP) was formed some 16 years ago. GGP is influential among Gond voters and the last year’s assembly polls saw emergence of Bhil tribal leadership in Malwa region, leading to formation of Jai Adivasi Yuwa Shakti (JAYS), a group of tribals who decided to contest polls, but later its leader contested on Congress ticket. JAYS is now again planning to contest from four seats as independent.

Before GGP and JAYS came into existence, there were traditional parties. Tribal people normally voted en masse, unlike the tactical voting in recent years.





Of the 29 seats in Madhya Pradesh, two different tribal groups have their influence on at least six seats including Shahdol, Mandla, Dhar, Ratlam, Khargone, and Betul, which are reserved for scheduled tribe. Besides, tribals can also influence results at several other seats like Balaghat, Chhindwara and Khandwa.

“Things have definitely changed and the change is apparent. People are becoming aware day by day. It is not important that we have won seats or not, but it is clear that our movement is bringing out colours, for example when prime minister Narendra Modi came to Mandla he also has to say, ‘Jai Bada Dev’, what led to this? It is the same awareness about our identity that led to this. We are nature worshippers, ‘Bhagwan’ for us means ‘Bh’ for ‘bhumi’ ‘W’ for ‘Wayu’ and ‘N’ for ‘neer’ and we are working to establish ‘gram swarajya’, get a separate identity, implement schedule 5 so that the livelihood of the tribal population is secured and our language ‘Gondi’ should be included in the 8th schedule of the Constitution. Our people are now waking up to assert the rights given in the Constitution,” Aman Singh Porte of GGP said.

“Schedule 5 is among the common issues raised by various tribal groups in the state. Besides, there are several other specific demands too,” he said.

Among several tribal communities in Madhya Pradesh, the Gond community has a major influence in Mahakaushal region and can impact results in Balaghat, Mandla and Shahdol, while Bheels have a sizable presence in the Malwa-Nimar region.

Implementation of Schedule 5, which gives autonomy to tribal areas, is the primary demand of tribals. “But unlike Mahakaushal, tribals in Malwa-Nimar are not much into their religious identity and are more attached to its language and region. Apart from implementation of Schedule 5, Bheels are also demanding inclusion of Bheeli language into schedule 8 of the Constitution and a separate Bheelistan region,” said founder of JAYS and now a Congress MLA Dr Hiralal Alawa.

“We are planning to field independent candidates from four seats. If we do not get into coalition with any party, we will support independent candidates from four seats,” Alawa said.

Political parties are too, aware of the increasing awareness about rights among the tribal populations across the state.

Congress leaders, however, blame the BJP rule of 15 years for creating a divide among the tribals of state.

“Our slogan is ‘ek teer ek kaman, saare adivasi ek saman’ (one bow, one arrow, all tribals are equal). It is on our agenda to address the needs of everyone, be it group or individual. But our priority is to ensure the fulfilment of basic needs of the entire tribal population. After doing so, we will move towards group-specific needs of the people. Tribal population had remained united. But the 15-year long BJP rule created divides among the tribals through their subsidiary organisations,” chairman of Madhya Pradesh Adivasi Congress, Ajay Shah Makrai told TOI.

BJP leaders however believe that it is due to the self-centred small groups that a divide has been created among tribals in the state. “The small region or community-based groups have created a divide among tribals for their own selfish needs. They woo the simple tribal population and then create divisions. During the BJP rule in state, we have addressed the concerns of each and every group, like pension was announced for Saharia tribal women, pension was also announced for Bharia tribal women. We are going to voters with the work done during our rule,” vice president of BJP’s ST wing, Uttam Thakur said.

Modi government knows how to deliver on promises: Gujarat CM - Times of India

","
VADODARA: Gujarat Chief minister Vijay Rupani Friday said the upcoming Lok Sabha elections is a contest between a ""decisive"" Central government and an ""indecisive past"".



He said India hardly witnessed any development under the Congress governments and alleged the grand old party was responsible for corruption the country.

Addressing a public rally here, Rupani said the Narendra Modi government has shown the courage to conduct surgical strikes in all spheres -- land, air and space.

He later led a rally which concluded at the office of the district collector where BJP candidate Ranjanben Bhatt filed her nomination papers for the Vadodara Lok Sabha seat.

The Gujarat CM said the voters have made up their mind to give a second term in office to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The April-May Lok Sabha election will be a contest between a ""decisive"" central government and an ""indecisive past"", Rupani said, slamming the Congress and its decades-old rule.

He said the country now has a government which knows how to deliver on promises.

""India has made up its mind who to vote for PM Modi. For proof, see the large number of people attending this rally,"" he said.

Rupani said, ""It was the chowkidar's (Modi's) government that had the courage to conduct surgical strikes on land, air and space.""

Accusing the Congress of just repeating its slogan of 'garibi hatao', Rupani said the Rahul Gandhi-led party can never understand the sentiments of people

Why BJP is eyeing a breach in Didi’s West Bengal fortress - Times of India

","
KOLKATA: In the last Lok Sabha election, when the Modi wave carried BJP and NDA to a brute majority in the Lok Sabha, BJP won just two of Bengal's 42 Lok Sabha seats. It was just one seat more than the 2009 election, when it won only Darjeeling, but the preview to an emerging story lay in the BJP's vote share: from just 6.1 per cent in 2009, it rose to 16.8 per cent in 2014.


Five years on, BJP is talking up Bengal as one of the states where it will make gains. At a rally in North Bengal's Alipurduar on Friday, BJP chief 

  Amit Shah said the party will win 23 seats
 + . On the other hand, Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, who has emerged nationwide as the face of anti-BJP opposition, has 

  set an all-42 target
 + for her party.




There is no doubt that BJP is a growing force in Bengal. In the 2016 assembly elections, it increased its vote share (10.3 per cent) to within touching distance of Congress (12.4 per cent). In terms of seats, the party bagged only three of the 294 in the assembly, but compared with 2011 when it won no seats, its vote share was up by 6 per cent. And as BJP grew, CPM suffered the heaviest losses - in a state it ruled for three decades, CPM's vote share fell by 10 per cent or more in both the 2014 Lok Sabha and 2016 Assembly polls.

In subsequent polls, BJP has improved further. The party came second in municipal elections such as Durgapur and Cooper's Camp in Nadia and was ahead of CPM and Congress taken together in the 2018 panchayat polls.

But it's not the CPM or Congress which BJP needs to worry about in Bengal. Mamata's Trinamool Congress bagged nearly 40% of the votes in the 2014 Lok Sabha election and a whopping 45.3 per cent in the assembly polls of 2016. It improved its vote share significantly as well in both elections, sealing its position as the overwhelmingly dominant political power in Bengal, where it currently holds 34 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats and 211 of the 294 assembly seats.

While Mamata focuses her attack on the Modi government on issues like demonetisation, intolerance, and using central agencies against the opposition, the BJP camp is galvanised too because it feels it has sensed a ""groundswell"" against Trinamool. It wants to turn the tables on Mamata riding the post-Balakot sentiment; it is aiming at a counter-consolidation of the majority community against Trinamool's perceived ""minority appeasement"" and ""vote bank"" politics.

The perception is growing in some areas, manifest in communal incidents in at least 10 places in post-2014 Bengal. In the Cooch Behar and Uluberia Lok Sabha bypolls and Kanthi and Noapara assembly bypolls, BJP made significant gains and came second. Some of the seats where BJP is eyeing a good show, if things work to plan, are Cooch Behar, Alipurduar, Raiganj, Balurghat, Malda (North), Krishnanagar, Ranaghat, Purulia, Midnapore, Asansol, Kolkata (North), Howrah, Barrackpore and Bongaon.


Complete coverage: Lok Sabha elections

But BJP is yet to gain the mass base and organisational muscle to take on Trinamool in many seats. It has eroded Left and Congress vote banks but is yet to make a dent in the Trinamool's ascending vote share, except in pockets. The party had a 20 per cent and above vote share in as many 12 Lok Sabha seats in 2014 even at the height of the Modi wave. After Balakot, BJP has often used ""anti-India"" and pro-Pakistan"" labels for the opposition.

Mamata, meanwhile, has her problems. The opposition hasn't united in Bengal; Left and Congress continue to be her vocal political rivals. There's also wariness on disgruntled Trinamool workers and violent intraparty feuds. Security has been increased for as many as 17 Trinamool leaders, showing that the party is not confident about its own men.

Bengal will vote in all seven phases. And the voter will have a lot of time to think.

Deve Gowda breathes easy as Congress rebel candidate pulls out of contest - Times of India

","
BENGALURU: In a big relief to JD(S) patriarch and former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda, Congress sitting MP from Tumkur S P Muddahanumegowda Friday pulled out of the contest as the rebel candidate against him.


Gowda is the joint nominee of Karnataka's Congress-JD(S) ruling alliance, which was worried over his electoral prospects after Muddahanumegowda jumped into the fray defying the understanding under which the seat was allotted to the JD(S).

""Angry"" at being denied the ticket, Muddahanumegowda had filed his papers both as party candidate and as an independent but finally yielded to persuasion from the party leadership.

The leadership made several attempts to pacify Muddahanumegowda, with Congress president Rahul Gandhi and AICC general secretary K C Venugopal intervening finally.

Muddahanumegowda told PTI that he has withdrawn his nomination, respecting the ""persuasion"" made by the Congress high command.

""Rahul Gandhi himself spoke to me (Thursday morning), K C Venugopal spoke to me several times, also our KPCC president, deputy chief minister and also CLP leader Siddaramaiah started persuading me and said the coalition is at stakebecause of my nomination as rebel,"" he said.

""Though my people did not agree for withdrawing nomination, somehow I had to, as I didn't want to become reasonfor anything going wrong between two parties,"" he added.

Muddahanumegowda said he was ""angry"" and ""furious"" for thereason that the sitting MP was deprived of contesting election.

He said he had filed the nomination as constituency leaders and workers insisted on his contesting, after his request to coalition leaders to reconsider the decision and field him, did not yield result.

The Congress leader said he had gone through ""agony and mental torture"" after being denied ticket despite being ""active and performing member.""

Asked about campaigning for Gowda, he said, ""I'm a sensitive politician..I will think over..I will need some time.""

Muddahanumegowda, who had worked as a judicial officer in the past is the only member among ten sitting Congress MPs from the state denied ticket, citing coalition compulsions.

Earlier in the day, Deputy Chief Minister GParameshwara and KPCC chief Dinesh Gundu Rao visited Muddahanumegowda's residence in the city to persuade him, as Friday was the last day to withdraw nomination.

Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Rao said the party has respect for Muddahanumegowda and conceded that ""injustice"" has happened to him, as he blamed coalition compulsions for it.

""It is the responsibility of the party to treat him respectfully,"" he added.

Meanwhile, K N Rajanna, another Congress leader and former MLA who also had filed his nomination from Tumkur as anindependent candidate, upset over his party's decision to cede the seat to JD(S), has also withdrawn his nomination.

Stating that he was with Muddahanumegowda, Rajanna told reporters he will abide by the party's decision.

The JD(S) bagged Tumkur seat after a hard bargain withthe Congress as the grand old party did not concede Mysore, another seat that it had demanded, due to strong resentment from Siddaramaiah, as it is his home turf.

Mysore and Tumkur both come under old Mysuru region where Vokkaliga community, seen as a strong vote bank of JD(S) is dominant.

The Congress too has considerable presence there.

Gowda opted for Tumkur seat over Bangalore North, another option that was available before him, after giving up Hassan Lok Sabha seat that he had been representing, tograndson Prajwal Revanna.

If Muddahanumegowda had contested from Tumkur as a rebel candidate, it would have added to the Congress-JD(S) coalition worries as the alliance is facing backlash at several places, including Mandya and Hassan, with party workersunhappy with the seat arrangements.

For the coalition to emerge as a formidable opposition to BJP and win more number of seats, it is crucial for the Congress to transfer its votes to JD(S), and vice-versa.

The BJP has fielded G S Basavaraj as its candidate from Tumkur which will go to polls in the first phase on April 18.

NEW DELHI: Congress chief Rahul Gandhi indicated he is open to contesting a second seat, possibly 

  Wayanad in Kerala
 + , and said a decision is to be taken soon. He said there is nothing unusual about contesting two seats and cited PM Narendra Modi running from Varanasi and Vadodara in 2014.



Fight polls from Karnataka: Siddaramaiah's invite to Rahul GandhiAccording to Congress sources, the idea to invite Rahul or sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to contest from Karnataka had been discussed long ago keeping in mind the attention the late PM Indira Gandhi and Rahul's mother Sonia Gandhi got when they contested from Chikkamagaluru (1978) and Ballari (1999) Lok Sabha seats, respectively.

Though there have been reports of Rahul contesting from Wayanad, this is the first time he has confirmed the possibility. ""Amethi is my 'karmabhoomi' and shall always remain so. I am deeply grateful for the love, affection and the sentiments expressed by our party workers in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala who have asked me to contest a second seat from their states,"" he said in an interview to PTI.

He also responded to sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's recent comment that she would be willing to contest if the party wants her to, saying the issue has been left to her.

AHMEDABAD: Patidar quota stir leader Hardik Patel got a jolt from the Gujarat high court on Friday as it rejected his application seeking a stay on his conviction in a rioting case so that he could contest the 2019 elections.


With Gujarat going to polls on April 23, it is a race against time for Hardik as his only hope now is to challenge the HC order in Supreme Court. With the last date for filing nomination in Gujarat on April 4, he is left with time until 3 pm on Thursday next.

Hardik, who recently joined Congress, will reach Delhi shortly to seek legal counsel from party leader Kapil Sibal. ""He will canvass against BJP in Gujarat and across the country in case he does not get legal nod to file nomination in time,"" said Jayesh Patel, a close aide.

Hardik tweeted: ""My only mistake is that I refused to bow down to the BJP. Elections may come and go, but the BJP is working against the Constitution.""

SC notice to Centre, EC on plea seeking contempt proceedings for violation of court's order - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday issued notice to the Centre and the EC on a plea seeking initiation of contempt proceedings for alleged violation of the apex court's judgment directing all candidates to declare their criminal antecedents to the poll panel before contesting elections.


A bench comprising Justices R F Nariman and Vineet Saran also sought response from the three deputy election commissioners, law secretary and the cabinet secretary for not complying with its judgment dated September 25, 2018.

The court was hearing a plea filed by lawyer Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay.

In September last year, a five-judge Constitution bench had unanimously held that all candidates will have to declare their criminal antecedents to the Election Commission(EC) before contesting polls and had called for wider publicity, through print and electronic media about the antecedents of candidates.

On October 10 last year, the EC had issued notification regarding the amended Form-26, and directions to political parties and candidates for publication of criminal antecedents.

However, the plea filed by Upadhyay had alleged that the EC neither amended the Election Symbol Order, 1968 nor the model code of conduct (MCC) so the said notification has no legal sanction.

""On October 10, 2018, the ECI issued direction to political parties and candidates for publication of criminal antecedents without amending the Election Symbol Order & Model Code of Conduct so the direction has no legal sanction,"" the plea had said.

It had also said that the ECI did not publish a list of leading newspapers-news channels nor clarified the timing for declaration of criminal antecedents by candidates which led to the candidates publishing them in unpopular newspapers and news channels during odd hours.

""It (the ECI) had not published list of leading newspapers-news channels, so candidates published criminal antecedents in unpopular newspapers-news channels. The ECI has not clarified the timing of publication, so candidates published criminal history in odd hours when people don't watch news channels. Political parties had neither published the details on website nor in newspapers or news channels during assembly elections, but the ECI did nothing against them,"" the plea had alleged.

""On March 10, the ECI announced the dates of General Election without amending the Election Symbol Order & Model Code of Conduct, which is essential for compliance of Judgment dated 25.9.2018 hence petitioner is filing the contempt petition,"" it had said.

BJP's nationalism is about using religion and martyrs for politics: Priyanka Gandhi to cadres - Times of India

","
RAE BARELI: In her scathing attack on BJP and Modi government, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi said that Congress doesn't need any certificate from anyone to prove its nationalist feelings.


""Ye brashtachar ki baat karnewale sabse bade brashta hain… kaam ki baat karte hain magar sabse bade nikamme hain… dharma ki baat karne wale sabse bada adharm kar rahe hain - dharm ka istemal kar rahe hain… saheedon ka istemal kar rahe hain - sirf rajinit ke liye (They are talking of acting against corruption but are corrupt themselves… they talk of work but are good for nothing… they talk of dharma (read duties) but indulge in adharma by defying its norms - they use religion and martyrs for political interests),"" Priyanka stated in her closed door meeting with cadres on Thursday. 

The Congress leader hit out at BJP's strategy of playing the nationalist card. ""We are Congress… we launched the freedom movement… gave our blood and sweat… braved British atrocities … we don't need any certificate to prove our nationalist feelings especially from the ones who apologised to the British at that time"", asserted Priyanka, urging the workers to go to every household in their area and meet every voter.

She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, ""Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.""

Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. ""Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,"" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning.

""When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied… saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,"" Priyanka said quoting her brother.

The Congress general secretary told the workers that she was working on mission 2022. ""We will, with your support, form the government in 2022. And once we come, we will stay here for long on the basis of our hard work,"" she said adding that the hard-workers would be adequately rewarded.

Battleground northeast: BJP in friendly fights, while Congress is without too many friends - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: While resentment over the Citizenship Bill has led to tensions between BJP and its partners, a much-diminished Congress has managed to take only small steps towards finding partners.

Sikkim: SDF manifesto promises sops for youth - Times of India

","
GANGTOK: Sikkim chief minister and SDF president Pawan Kumar Chamling on Friday announced various sops for the youth, including a one-time grant of Rs 5 lakh to those starting a livelihood venture, if his party is voted to power again.


""Our policy is youth first ... youth has always been our priority,"" he said while releasing the election manifesto of his party, Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF), at the Vijay Sankalp Rally in West Sikkim's Soreng town.

He said that those youth not opting for Startup scheme will be given a one-time grant of Rs five lakh by the SDF government for starting a livelihood venture.

Chamling, who is the founding president of the SDF, also promised that his government will increase the startup loan to Rs 30 Lakh from Rs 20 lakh.

Our government will launch a scheme 'One Person, One Profession' whereby every eligible individual will be helped with a profession, he said.

The SDF president also promised to institute a Youth Forum in order to make Youths partners in policy making of his government.

He said that his government will make education free up to university level.

Chamling, who is spearheading the SDF's bid for a sixth consecutive term in power in Sikkim urged the voters to trust him to safeguard their future saying that he was a seasoned politician, not a seasonal politician.

Reeling out some achievements of his government during 25 years, he said that Sikkim is the first state in the country to fulfil basic minimum needs of its people.

""My government has also ensured peace and security over the last 25 years to make Sikkim an oasis of peace in the world,"" he claimed.

Seeking to counter his political adversaries charge that unemployment has increased under his rule, Chamling said that his government had given Muster Roll (MR) jobs to 30,000 Sikkimese people and their jobs were regularised subsequently.

Similarly, those people getting government jobs under 'One Family, One Job' scheme late last year, will also be regularised, he said.

The SDF government will also regularise the workers under various public sector undertakings (PSUs) in Sikkim, he said.

The Chief Minister said that loans taken from SABCO, including educational loans and loans taken for agriculture will be waived off by our next government.

Chamling sought to woo the farmers too by saying that his next government will provide cash assistance of Rs 60,000 to organic farmers and financially poor families.

Additionally, agricultural implements of Rs 40,000 will also be provided to the farmers under a scheme called 'Financial Security'.

Seeking to cash in on regional sentiments of the indigenous people, the SDF supremo said that his government has protected the rights and interests of the Sikkimese people by protecting Article 371F and Rule 4(4) and will continue to do so in future if elected to power again.

Article 371F in the constitution has special provisions with respect to the State of Sikkim.

Arun Jaitley calls 'Mahagathbandhan' a political circus, recipe for chaos - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Taking a swipe at the grand alliance of opposition parties, finance minister Arun Jaitley on Friday said the 'mahagathbandhan' is a 'non-bandhan', political circus and a recipe for chaos.


Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11.

In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was ""exhausted"" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'.

The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party.

Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: ""We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.""

In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership.

According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament.

""He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,"" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections.

The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known.

Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi.

""Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds.

""Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,"" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

Opposition cashes in on clout of BJP's 'ticket-less' MPs - Times of India

","
LUCKNOW: With the BJP denying tickets to 12 MPs in Uttar Pradesh, the Opposition is planning to cash in on the clout of these disgruntled parliamentarians in the upcoming general elections.


In its list of 61 candidates, the saffron party has refused tickets to 12 MPs, two of whom have already switched sides and joined the rival parties - Samajwadi Party and Congress.

BJP Allahabad MP Shayama Charan Gupta and Bahraich MP Savitri Bai Phule are now official candidates of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Congress from Banda and Bahraich, respectively.

Another BJP MP Anshul Verma from Hardoi also joined the SP ahead of the polls, terming the ruling party ""anti-Dalits"".

Although Verma claimed that he joined the Akhilesh Yadav-led party ""without any condition"", the Samajwadi Party is planning to utilise his support base among the Dalits, especially in Hardoi area.

Asked about giving preference to BJP turncoats this election, SP MLC Rajpal Kashyap said such a strategy is only aimed at ""exposing misdeeds of the ruling party"" in the state.

""They are the ones who were on the ground for five years. They can very well tell the electorate what the BJP is and expose their misdeeds,"" he said.

""Our alliance with the BSP and RLD is very powerful and that is why these leaders have faith in us,"" Kashyap said.

The SP has tied up with Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Chaudhary Ajit Singh-led Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) for the Lok Sabha elections.

BJP MP Savitri Bai Phule, who resigned before the Lok Sabha polls were declared, is now a vocal critic of the saffron party.

""The BJP did nothing for dalits and backwards. Its government functions in an unconstitutional manner and is conspiring to end reservation. I will ensure defeat of the BJP in my constituency and am ready to campaign wherever my party sends me,"" she said.

BJP Ballia MP Bharat Singh had recently written an open letter to the people of his constituency.

""What is my fault? Why was I denied ticket? I have always taken up issues related to the constituency. The candidate announced from Ballia has no connect with the people here,"" he wrote.

Singh, however, did not talk about his future course of action.

BJP's Fatehpur Sikri MP, Chowdhury Babulal has also openly shown his resentment after being denied ticket.

In Kushinagar, supporters of BJP MP Rajesh Pandey protested against the denial of ticket to their leader and demanded the leadership to re-consider the decision.

Other prominent BJP leaders who are missing from the party's list of candidates this time are Murli Manohar Joshi (Kanpur), Prikanka Rawat (Barabanki), Union minister Krishna Raj (Shahjahanpur-SC), Anju Bala (Misrikh-SC), Satypal Saini (Sambhal) and Ashok Kumar Dohre (Etawah).

Commenting on the trend of leaders switching allegiance over denial of tickets, BJP spokesman Shalabh Mani Tripathi said, ""This happens during election time when leaders look for opportunities.

""Our cadre is intact and people have faith in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership. There will be no impact of these leaders going to other parties,"" he added.

Uttar Pradesh has 80 Lok Sabha seats, the highest in the country.

Home Loan: Middle-class laps up home loan subsidies 

","
NEW DELHI: The number of urban middle-class home buyers availing Centre’s interest subsidy scheme to purchase or build their first home has more than doubled in the past eight months as compared to the 2017-18 financial year. According to estimates, the number of beneficiaries is likely to cross one lakh by March end. 


Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced interest subsidy for two categories of middle income groups (MIGs) in urban areas with annual income of up to Rs 18 lakh, which came into effect from January 2017. “We are expecting higher demand as more and more people submit their applications. In some cases, banks may not have taken that keen interest since they don’t see greater business. As government pays the entire interest subsidy of Rs 2.3 lakh upfront, the outstanding loan amount gets reduced and hence banks also get less interest,” said a source.

But he added the situation is changing fast as more builders are focussing on building flats that are affordable for MIGs and the home buyers have also become more demanding. The government has so far disbursed Rs 6,300 crore to 2.75 lakh beneficiaries as direct financial assistance under four different components to help people build a home or buy a flat, housing secretary D S Mishra said on Wednesday.

According to ministry’s data, majority of the beneficiaries, about 56%, availed the central assistance to build independent houses; 33% went for buying a flat and about 7% beneficiaries were the earlier slum dwellers who got a flat where they lived for years. Mishra said about 3.89 lakh dwelling units have already been completed for rehabilitating slum dwellers.

The ministry also claimed it has sanctioned 65 lakh houses under PM Awas Yojna (Urban) and 12 lakh houses have been completed in the past four years against only 18,000 completed during UPA-I and II. “We are confident of sanctioning 80 lakh out of the targeted one crore urban houses by March and complete about 25 lakh houses,” Mishra claimed.

Joint secretary (housing) Amrit Abhijat said the pace of delivery will increase since the works already started are at different stages of completion.

Markets take a breather; global stocks slide on Fed rate hike - Times of India

","
MUMBAI: Snapping a seven-day rising streak, equity benchmarks finished with mild losses Thursday amid a broad reversal across global markets following Fed's rate hike.


The BSE Sensex, which had dropped more than 250 points in morning trade, finally finished 52.66 points, or 0.14 per cent, lower at 36,431.67.

The broader NSE Nifty slipped 15.60 points, or 0.14 per cent, to 10,951.70.

World markets tumbled after the US Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate for the fourth time this year, and signalled more next year, albeit at a slower pace than expected. The quarter-point increase, to 2.25-2.5 per cent, lifted the Fed's key rate to its highest point since 2008.

A rebound in the rupee and softening crude oil prices cushioned the fall for the domestic markets, traders said.

Major gainers in the Sensex pack were Yes Bank, Hero MotoCorp, M&M, Asian Paints, Sun Pharma, Tata Motors, L&T and HDFC Bank, rising up to 3.93 per cent.

Losers included Bharti Airtel, SBI, Wipro, Vedanta, Maruti Suzuki, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and Reliance Industries, falling up to 2.18 per cent.

PSU bank stocks were the biggest losers on both exchanges, after the government sought Parliament's approval for additional gross expenditure of Rs 85,948.86 crore, about half of which is for capital infusion in public sector banks through recapitalisation bonds, during the current fiscal.

On a net basis, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth Rs 1,209.21 crore Wednesday, and domestic institutional investors (DIIs) were net sellers to the tune of Rs 481.46 crore, provisional data available with BSE showed.

Globally, the Fed's move came despite US President Donald Trump's attacks in the recent weeks on its rate hikes and on chairman Jerome Powell personally. The president had complained that the moves are threatening the economy.

At a news conference after the Fed's announcement, Powell said Trump's tweets and statements would have no bearing on the central bank's policymaking.

Elsewhere in Asia, Korea's Kospi fell 0.90 per cent, Japan's Nikkei plunged 2.84 per cent, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.94 per cent and Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.52 per cent.

In Europe, Frankfurt's DAX fell 0.84 per cent and Paris' CAC 40 shed 1.33 per cent in their early deals. London's FTSE too slipped 0.84 per cent.

Cost of quitting Facebook? It might be ₹70,000/year - Times of India

","
BOSTON: Facebook users would require an average of more than $1,000 (about Rs 70,000) to deactivate their account for one year, according to a study.


The study, published in the journal ‘PLOS ONE’, assessed Facebook’s value to its users, in contrast to its market value or its contribution to gross domestic product.

Researchers from Tufts University in the US used a series of auctions in which people were actually paid to close their accounts for as little as one day or as long as one year.

Facebook, with over two billion global users, is among the social media websites that provide access at no cost.

The researchers found that Facebook users would require an average of over $1,000 or about Rs 70,000 to deactivate their account for one year.

“Social media, and the internet more broadly, have changed the way we live and the way we keep in touch with friends and family, but it’s hard to find evidence that the internet has made us richer or more productive at work,” said Jay Corrigan, a professor at Kenyon College in the US.

“We know people must derive tremendous value from Facebook or they wouldn’t spend millions of hours on the site every day. The challenge is how to put a dollar value on a service people don’t pay for,” Corrigan said.

The researchers ran three actual auctions, including two samples of college students, a community sample, and an online sample.

Winners were paid upon proof that their membership was deactivated for the set period of time. “Auction participants faced real financial consequences, so had an incentive to consider what compensation they would want to close their accounts for a set period of time and to bid truthfully,” said Sean B Cash, a professor.

“Students placed a higher value than community members. A number of participants refused to bid at all, suggesting that deactivating Facebook for a year was not a welcome possibility,” Cash said.

The study contrasts the company’s market capitalisation with the value placed on it by its users. Based on a market valuation of about $420 billion, and about 2.2 billion users, the market value of Facebook would be approximately $190 per user, or less than onefourth of the annual average value of Facebook access from any of the auction samples, researchers said.

Embracing the mobile workforce - Times of India

","
 Organizations must exert trust as employees increasingly seek remote working opportunities. Steve Jobs once said, ""Technology is nothing. What's important is that you have faith in people."" Arguably, the Apple co-founder's words are more relevant to today's business leaders than they were when he made them a quarter of a century ago. Back then, in 1994, remote workers made up near-zero of the global workforce. Today, it is extended to about 40 percent of all roles, says Strategy Analytics, with half of the world's workforce likely to become mobile by 2028. While technology has played an important part in facilitating mobile working, the desire for more flexible work arrangements is driving today's agenda. A recent study by Mercer says that 51 percent of workers want more flexible employment terms and that 71 percent of high performers attribute their achievements to flexible working. ""Having a job that's continuously on the move, working from home, or logging in while overseas - mobile working is a broad discipline that's becoming critical to the successes of companies,"" says Max Loh FCPA (Aust.), ASEAN and Singapore Managing Partner at EY. ""Employers, large and small, must acknowledge the preferences of today's workforce, and provide flexible arrangements that are win-win for both parties.""  The millennial opportunity By embracing mobile working, organisations can significantly broaden their talent pool. Not only will they attract talent that favours more flexible terms within their locality, but they can also extend their reach to workers located overseas, bolstering diversity and inclusivity. Research by Cloverpop shows that inclusive teams make decisions twice as fast with 50 percent fewer meetings and that decisions made and executed by diverse teams deliver 60 percent better results.      Mobile working is particularly favoured by millennials, who by 2025 will represent 75 percent of the global workforce, according to EY. For accountants currently entering the profession, expectations are vastly different from those preceding them. For Gen X and Baby Boomers, flexible working, if allowed, extends to flexible working hours and working from home, at most. Millennials, however, crave much more. According to Mercer, they desire short-term assignments over those more than a year in duration; they prefer to travel rather than stay in one place, and they also favour experiences over rewards. An added benefit is that the technologies needed to enable mobile working are inexpensive and easy to operate. Many of the tools used today, such as text, voice or video chat, and other business collaboration technologies, are either free of charge or are packaged with additional software. Combined with ubiquitous interconnectivity 24/7, accountancy has moved from a profession requiring office attendance during standard working hours, Monday to Friday, to one that can be performed anywhere in the world, and at any time. To help make this transition as smooth as possible, individuals can capitalize on the growing number of continuing professional development (CPD) programs that support remote working.    Barriers to adoption  Trust is the number one impediment to mobile working, Loh says. Executives are commonly concerned that mobile workers are not engaged in company activities - or worse, they are working for rival entities. Research by Mercer highlights that only half of senior leaders currently support flexible working.  Such angst, explains Loh, stems from the fact that most organizations focus on inputs, such as hours worked or status updates, rather than targeting measurable outcomes such as key performance indicators, qualitative and quantitative results, deadlines, client satisfaction, and meeting stakeholder expectations. By focusing on outcomes, organizations will not only have a clearer idea of how individuals are performing, but they will also be able to set goals and objectives that meet the needs of both organizations and mobile workers and encourage greater buy-in from management.   A further concern is a negative impact remote working might have on teamwork and collaboration. ""Working remotely doesn't mean working alone,"" Loh clarifies. ""Through technology and a commitment to collaboration, remote teams are able to co-create new ideas, which can rival those developed under one roof.""  Embracing change Flexible working presents the opportunity to rethink how organizations are structured. Traditionally, organizations have been divided by function, such as finance, HR, sales and marketing, and so forth. For some organizations, however, structuring around competencies, tasks or projects might be more productive. Organizations must also ensure they are forward-looking. ""Millennials want to work for an entity that is progressive and has a sense of purpose, supports their personal development, and invests in the best technologies,"" Loh says. In keeping its members at the forefront of the accounting profession, CPA Australia presents thought-leadership on a range of topics, including workplace best practices. The association provides an international designation and a wide variety of learning programs that prepare members to work remotely and globally. ""Mobile working will continue to accelerate in the future,"" says Loh. ""Organisations that openly welcome it will reap its many rewards.""

PSB officers on strike, protesting merger, seeking wage hike - Times of India

","
MUMBAI: Around 3.20 lakh officers from various state-run banks are a one-day strike on Friday seeking immediate wage revision and opposing the proposed merger of Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank with Bank of Baroda. 


The union also wants the wage revision, which is pending since November 1, 2017, for employees from scale 1-7. 

Bank managements have mandated the industry lobby Indian Bank Association (IBA) to negotiate for scale 1-3. 

""The IBA is also not coming forward to structure the 11th bipartite wage negotiations based on our charter of demands by discussing the wage revision for officers from scale 1-7 and also based on the concept of minimum wages as envisaged in the seventh Central pay commission report,"" All-India Bank Officers Confederation (AIBOC) general secretary Soumya Datta said. 

He said after 13 months of negotiations between the unions and IBA, the latter has offered a wage revision of 8 just percent. In the past wage settlement, which was for the period November 1, 2012 to October 31, 2017, the employees got a 15 percent hike. 

The IBA has also offered a variable pay based on the operating profit and return on assets. 

""Most banks are in losses due to large NPAs but for this an employee can't be held responsible,"" Datta said. 

The union is also opposing the proposed merger Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank with Bank of Baroda, saying this will not help the merged entity to tackle any of the problems it is facing, including the NPA menace. 

Meanwhile, the United Forum of Bank Unions has called for one-day strike on December 26 to protest against the proposed merger. 

This union is an umbrella body of nine unions, including All-India Bank Officers Confederation, All-India Bank Employees Association and the National Organisation of Bank Workers among others.

Court refuses to extend detention of Carlos Ghosn - Times of India

","
Auto titan Carlos Ghosn’s chances of getting out of jail were bolstered after a Japanese court refused a bid by prosecutors to extend his month-long detention, clearing way for lawyers to seek his release on bail. The Tokyo district court on Thursday dismissed an appeal by Japanese prosecutors to prolong the 64-year-old former Nissan Motor chairman’s imprisonment. Lawyers for Ghosn, who was arrested November 19 and later indicted for under-reporting his income, can now seek his freedom before the highprofile case goes on trial.


The investigators challenged an initial court decision against his release and lost. They may now appeal to the Supreme Court to keep Ghosn in custody for a further 10 days. Under Japanese rules, Ghosn’s lawyers can now request bail once prosecutors indict him again. Ghosn’s lawyers said they’ll apply for his release and if the request is approved, the car executive could be out as soon as Friday.

The arrest of the high-flying executive has rocked the world’s biggest auto alliance, raising questions over whether the decades-long partnership between Nissan and Renault will survive his downfall. Ghosn was indicted on Dec. 10 for understating his income from Nissan by 4.8 billion yen ($43 million) in the five years to March 2015.

He was re-arrested for understating compensation for three-year period up to March this year. Since Ghosn’s arrest at a Tokyo airport, prosecutors have repeatedly extended his detention. On Thursday, the court rejected an appeal to extend the detention of Ghosn aide Greg Kelly, who was arrested at the same time over his alleged role in helping the executive understate his pay. Kelly’s lawyers plan to file for bail Thursday or Friday, Kyodo reported.

Petrol will cost only Rs 34 per litre without taxes and dealer commission in NCR - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Petrol will cost only Rs 34.04 per cent per litre and diesel Rs 38.67/litre without taxes and dealer's commission in the national capital region.


Giving details of the prices of petroleum products as on December 19 in a written reply to the Lok Sabha, minister of state for finance Shiv Pratap Shukla said the incidence of taxes and dealers commissions work out to be 96.9 per cent in case of petrol and 60.3 per cent for diesel.

On December 19, the retail price of petrol was Rs 70.63 a litre. This included, Rs 17.98 central excise duty, Rs 15.02 state VAT and Rs 3.59 commission of dealer.

In case of diesel, the retail price was Rs 64.54 (central excise duty of Rs 13.83, state VAT of Rs 9.51 and dealer commission of Rs 2.53).

Prices of petrol and diesel, which are market determined, change on daily basis.

The prices of the fuel varies across the country as states and Union Territories levy their own rate of VAT (value added tax).

In another reply, the minister said the Centre collected excise duty of Rs 73,516.8 crore on petrol and Rs 1.5 lakh crore on diesel during the last financial year.

In first six months of the current fiscal, the collection stands at Rs 25,318.1 crore and Rs 46,548.8 crore for petrol and diesle, respectively.

The government had cut the excise duty on fuel prices in October in order to tackle increasing prices of petrol and diesel.

The estimated loss of revenue to the central government is about Rs 7,000 crore post the reduction in excise duty on October 4 in the remaining part of the fiscal, the minister added.

ICPA seeks long-term fleet expansion plan for Air India - Times of India

","
MUMBAI: Air India's narrow-body pilots union ICPA has blamed capacity deficiency vis--vis competitors for its plunging domestic market share while seeking a long-term plan for aircraft fleet expansion at the carrier.


In a letter to civil aviation minister Suresh Prabhu last week, the Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA) also lamented that while other domestic carriers have placed huge aircraft order with both Airbus and Boeing, Air India will be inducting only five planes in its fleet going forward.

""We have remained quite stagnant in the domestic market. We still continue to operate 350-odd daily flights on domestic routes from about 300 flights 10 years ago...The load factor across all Air India flights is very high, but market share is slipping for want of additional capacity,"" the ICPA said.

On the contrary, budget carrier IndiGo has scaled up its operations to over 1,000 flights per day in over 10-year period, it pointed out in the December 10 letter to Prabhu.

According to ICPA, Air India's market share dropped from 19.8 per cent in January 2014 to just 11.8 per cent in September this year, which incidentally is the lowest market share ever for the carrier.

The Gurugram-based no-frills IndiGo currently commands over 40 per cent of the total domestic passenger traffic.

Propelled initially by the low jet fuel prices and later excess capacity on local routes, the domestic passengers' travel demand has been witnessing double digit growth since August 2014.

""All the private carriers together have hundreds of aircraft on order to keep themselves at par with the demand of ever growing domestic aviation market with a futuristic view of at least the next decade,"" the ICPA said.

However, ""we (Air India) have just five more A-320 aircraft to join us out of the 27 ordered on lease about three years back,"" the association said in the letter.

The carrier had plans to induct on lease latest Airbus A320 Neo planes in 2016, but it was cut to 29 planes following the government's decision to partially privatise it.

Of the 29 planes, 14 were to replace the nearly three decade-old classic A320s.

Notably, Air India has not bought a single aircraft since 2006 when it placed order for purchasing 111 aircraft 68 from Boeing and 43 from Airbus.

While the Airbus completed the order in 2010, Boeing delivered the last aircraft from the 2006 order in March this year.

At the same time, all major domestic private carriers are set to induct a large number of aircraft in their fleet over the next 5 to 10 years.

According to a CAPA report, India's order has already crossed 1,000 planes and over 100 planes are to be delivered to them each year over the five years.

The ICPA in the letter said while the airline may have expanded its operations on the wide-body aircraft with new flights to the US and Europe, there remain some untapped markets particularly in Africa, which should be explored.

""For our survival and to make sure that our market share does not decline any further, increasing our fleet of modern and fuel efficient of both narrow and wide body (aircraft) is of paramount importance,"" it said.

The aircraft order should be with a long-term view of at least 5 to 10 years and not in piecemeal manner, it added.

Karandeep Anand: Facebook elevates Indian-origin executive to head Workplace - Times of India

","
NEW YORK: Karandeep Anand, an Indian-origin senior executive of Facebook, will head the social media giant's enterprise communications tool Workplace, the company has announced.


Anand, who worked at Microsoft for 15 years before joining Facebook nearly four years ago, will work closely with Julien Codorniou, the Facebook vice president who has been the leader of Workplace, a television channel reported.

Workplace, the London-based Facebook division, is a communications tool for companies and businesses.

Anand will handle the Workplace product team, which includes developers, engineers, researchers and data scientists, while Codorniou will remain in charge of sales and partnerships, a Facebook spokeswoman was quoted as saying in the report.

At Facebook, Anand has been the head of product for a number of other divisions, including Marketplace, Audience Network and Ad Solutions, the report said.

""I'm excited to now be part of the journey of bringing Workplace to companies across the globe and help them unlock the potential of their biggest asset - people,"" Anand wrote on his LinkedIn profile.

The spokeswoman said: ""We're thrilled that Karandeep is joining Workplace as its new head of Workplace, effectively immediately.

""Karandeep joins Workplace from Marketplace, and brings with him a wealth of experience from both a consumer and enterprise background. We're excited to have him on board"".

In its two years of existence, Workplace by Facebook has big-name customers like Walmart, Starbucks and Chevron, the report said.

However, it is behind its rivals like Microsoft and Slack in the enterprise communications software market.

Workplace is used by 30,000 organisations, according to a Facebook report in October 2017.

Microsoft Teams is used by 329,000 organisations while Slack by 500,000 organisations, including 70,000 paying organisations, the report added.

Lodha to exit UK property market; to sell 2 projects in London for Rs 4,200 cr - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Realty major Lodha Developers will exit the UK property market and is in advanced stage to sell two of its residential projects in central London for about Rs 4,200 crore, a top company official said on Wednesday.


Exiting the UK property market, is part of the company's strategy to reduce debt and strengthen its balance sheet.

Lodha Developers, which aims to launch IPO when market condition improves, is also looking to raise about Rs 700 crore by selling stake in a mid-income housing project in Mumbai to private equity players, taking the total fund raising to nearly Rs 5,000 crore.

Mumbai-based company had forayed into the London market in 2013 with the acquisition of the landmark MacDonald House at 1 Grosvenor Square in prime Central London from the Canadian government for over GBP 300 million (Rs 3,100 crore).

The group acquired another site in prime Central London, New Court at 48 Carey Street for 90 million pounds in 2014.

""We are in advance stage of selling our equity interest in UK assets,"" Lodha Developers' MD Abhishek Lodha told PTI.

The deal with a UK-based investment fund is likely to be concluded soon, he said, adding the fund would be utilised to prepay/repay debt, which currently is around Rs 18,000 crore.

The company's board is focussed on ensuring a significant upgrade in its ratings in the next 12 months with a goal of being in the AA category.

Lodha said the company would be earning 15-16 per cent return on investment in the UK market.

Lodha UK launched its first project Lincoln Square in 2016 and has so far achieved a sales booking of 170 million pounds. The second project 'No.1 Grosvenor Square', located in the heart of Mayfair, was launched in 2017.

While the Lincoln Square project has 221 housing units, the housing project at Grosvenor Square has 39 apartments and 5 duplexes with starting price of 7.5 million pound. The two projects will complete the two projects in 2019.

The projects are fully funded from lenders and have sold well (about 500 million pounds of sales achieved already). Lodha UK will continue to be the development manager of these projects and the projects will be delivered to the highest standards.

On India business, Lodha said the company achieved a sales bookings of Rs 4,200 crore in the first six months of this fiscal and the sales have been good in October and November months. ""Our 50 per cent of business is mid-income housing"".

The company is also developing rental assets worth Rs 10,000 crore, of which one-fourth is completed. Its annual rental will be Rs 175 crore by March 2019.

Lodha Developers has got approval in July to hit the capital market with an initial public offer (IPO) of about Rs 5,500 crore.

The share sale, if successful, would be the second biggest IPO in the real estate sector after DLF that raised close to Rs 9,200 crore in 2007. This would be the second attempt by Lodha Developers to launch a public issue and list its shares on the stock exchanges.

Lodha Developers had posted a 32 per cent rise in its consolidated net profit at Rs 790 crore during the last fiscal from Rs 599 crore in the previous year.

Total income rose by 22 per cent to Rs 9,700 crore in 2017-18 from Rs 7,957 crore in the previous year.

financial adviser news: Why you may need an adviser - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: The large unutilised balance in the savings bank account leads to pangs of regret. So we browse investment options. Someone recommends an adviser or relationship manager. We talk, but are unimpressed. Why is this so tough? What exactly are the constraints?


First, we don’t make money decisions easily. We are fine with the money lying idle and console ourselves that at least it is not losing value in a wrong investment. Second, we are unable to simplify the investment selection process. We feel we should evaluate everything, have some basis for selection that is robust, and choose the best among the lot. We choose based on our needs and form expectations about how it would work for us. Product selection is not an exact science.

Third, we are quite mixed up about timing. Some of us think that timing is everything and whether we make money or not depends on when we invested and when we took the money out. Fourth, we are ill-prepared to deal with unexpected events like markets crash, political events that can alter economy, and so on. It is tough dealing with panic. Fifth, despite the best research and analysis, some of our investments could underperform. Making the decision to sell what is not working can be difficult. Portfolio review is not easy for many of us. Therefore, it is important to consider how we deal with these constraints and figure out the choice between engaging a financial adviser and DIY. At the same time, for advisers to add value, they should be able to persuade you to organise your finances so that you identify your goals and invest for them.

Some of us are very enamored by the markets, and find the process of investing very stimulating. Some have a great skill in execution, and find it easy to follow through and complete planned investment decisions. Some are in charge of money and find the costs of outsourcing painful. DIY is suitable in such cases. Choose whatever keeps your money well deployed and closely monitored, whether by your adviser or you. Don’t let it lie idle because you haven’t been able to decide either way.

HP, Kerala, Tamil Nadu lead performers in Niti's SDG index - Times of India

","
New Delhi, Dec 21 () Himachal Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu have emerged as top performing states in Niti Aayog's SDG India index 2018, which evaluates progress in social, economic and environmental terms, according to a report released on Friday. Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh are the worst performing states in the government think tank's first of its kind India Index for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The Aayog has developed the SDG India Index which is a comprehensive index to measure progress of states/UTs, through a single measurable index and the First Baseline Report for 2018 was prepared with the support of United Nations in India. The index took into account 13 out of 17 goals specified by United Nation's as SDGs and left out four goals because of lack of data at the state level. Under the index, states will be monitored on real time basis across 62 of 306 national indicators outlined by the United Nations. The United Nations sponsored SDG has 17 goals, 169 targets and 306 national indicators.  ""Kerala's top rank is attributed to its superior performance in providing good health, reducing hunger, achieving gender equality and providing quality education. ""Himachal Pradesh ranks high on providing clean water and sanitation, in reducing inequalities and preserving mountain ecosystem,"" the document titled 'SDG India Index Baseline Report 2018' said. Among the UTs, Chandigarh took the lead because of its exemplary performance in providing clean water and sanitation to people. With regard to poverty reduction, the states which have done well include Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tamil Nadu. On 'zero hunger' parameters, Goa, Kerala, Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland were the front runners, according to the document. On the report, Niti Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar said, ""The 'SDG India Index: Baseline report 2018' highlights the progress being made by states and UTs in moving towards multiple targets of the SDGs, in the true spirit of cooperative and competitive federalism."" Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said the SDG India Index tracks the progress of all states & UTs on 62 national indicators and has been developed to provide a holistic view on social, economic and environmental status of the country. The SDGs are an ambitious commitment by world leaders which set out a universal and an unprecedented agenda which embraces economic, environmental and social aspects of the wellbeing of societies. The progress of the world to meet the SDGs, largely depends on India's progress, the document said. India played a prominent role in the formulation of SDGs and much of the country's National Development Agenda is mirrored in the SDGs,it added. ""They are a part of 'Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development', which was adopted by 193 member states at the historic United Nations General Assembly Summit in September 2015, and came into effect on January 1, 2016,"" the document said.

RBI limits total outstanding ECBs to 6.5 pc of GDP - Times of India

","
MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Thursday announced a cap on the outstanding stock of external commercial borrowings (ECB) at 6.5 per cent of GDP at current market prices.


Based on the gross domestic product (GDP) figures at March-end 2018, the soft limit works out to USD 160 billion for the current financial year, the RBI said in a statement.

""The outstanding stock of ECB as on September 30, 2018, stood at USD 126.29 billion,"" it said.

The decision to have a ""rule-based dynamic limit"" for outstanding stock of ECB at 6.5 per cent of GDP at current market prices has been taken in consultation with the government, the RBI added.

ECBs refer to commercial loans in the form of bank loans, securitised instruments (floating rate notes and fixed rate bonds, non-convertible, optionally convertible or partially convertible preference shares), buyers' credit, suppliers' credit availed of from non-resident lenders with a minimum average maturity of 3 years.

Farm loan waiver: Why economy will have 'sleepless' nights - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: In a country where 93% of Indians are sleep deprived — sleeping for less than 8 hours a day — Congress President 

  Rahul Gandhi's threat
 + to not let Prime Minister Narendra Modi sleep till farm loans are written off, may or may not impact the PM's REM pattern but will surely cause 'sleepless' nights and days for the economy.



Like a flu: Following the decision in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh by their respective chief ministers Kamal Nath and Bhupesh Baghel to waive farm loans, of up to Rs 2 lakh in MP and Rs 6,100 crore for 16 lakh farmers in Chhattisgarh, Assam has also clambered onto the waive-wagon, announcing its decision to write off Rs 600 crore of farmers' loans, which will benefit 8 lakh farmers. Today, Rajasthan became the fourth state this week to write off farm loans.



Why income support, not farm loan waiver, may be better for allThe RBI in a report had said that debt waivers can deflect the state from its fiscal consolidation path. ""An Income Support Scheme for small and marginal farmers might turn out be a viable solution,” said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic advisor, SBI.








Damn the economy: The RBI, in a report on state finances in July, had cautioned against the propensity of waiving loans as they were increasing the fiscal deficits of the states, which were facing a double whammy of lower GST revenues — there has been an increase of 0.05% in the fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP, from 0.27% to 0.32% in the last financial year. This was, in fact, the second time the RBI red-flagged farm loan waivers — it had also earlier done so in 2017. Given the proximity to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, there are valid fears that the waiver mania may result in fiscal deficit touching 2% of the GDP.






When loan waiver hype meets the farm realityFormulas to waive farm loans are not uniform across states. Rajasthan, for instance, calculates waivers based on the amount of crop damaged, size of land holdings and harvest volume. Others have fixed limits for the amount to be waived. Many farmers across India who TOI spoke to said the hastily put together and poorly executed approach will not solve systemic problems.



Self-inflicted wound: Farm loan waivers have also resulted in a spike in banks' NPAs, in the agricultural sector as well as pushing the farmers into borrowing from money lenders at an exorbitant interest rate — that's because banks become wary of lending to farmers fearing loan write-offs by the government, which reduces sources of credit for the farmers who are then forced into borrowings from informal sources of finance.



10 reasons why farmers are in distressTwo successive years of drought (2014, 2015) have taken a toll on the farm sector. The government has allocated significant funds for the sector but slow implementation of projects has not eased the pain.

Arun Jaitley: Sound policy, not slogans will take people out of poverty 

","
NEW DELHI: In an apparent attack on the opposition, Union finance minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday said that sound policy, not slogans will help in alleviating poverty and fulfilling aspirations of people.


He said slogans have transient life and people soon realise that they cannot be implemented.

There is an obvious debate on whether sound policy pays more or slogans pay more, he said after the release of 'Strategy for New India @75' prepared by Niti Aayog.

""In democracy these debates will always arise...The aspirational people who have high level of aspiration and very low level of patience now will point out on day two or day three about the inability to convert slogans into reality,"" Jaitley said.

However, he said, ""sound policy will always put economy on track in which it will get perpetually people out of poverty and give them better quality of life.""

Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said his party and other opposition parties would force Prime Minister Narendra Modi to waive farmer loans, and that the Congress will do it after 2019 general election if the Modi government failed to act immediately.



Won't let PM Modi sleep until all farm loans waived, says Rahul; BJP hits backIn a stinging attack on what he described as crony capitalism, Rahul Gandhi said the government has turned a blind eye to the loans given to 15 top industrialists of the country, including Anil Ambani, but has made no effort to alleviate the woes of the farmers in the last four years. ""We will not let PM Modi sleep until loans of all farmers are waived,"" he said.


""The course we have adopted is now gradually perfected itself with Indian model in which you grow faster, you utilise the resource of the state in order to pull out millions of people out of poverty, give them better quality of life...each decision is really aimed in this direction,"" Jaitley said.

""Historically we have squandered several opportunities. Fortunately, we are on the cusp of making history wherein the last few decades India has started making full utilisation of those opportunities and that seems to be the course to go ahead,"" he added.

About Niti Aayog's strategy document, he said it will be fruitful for the government.

The document aims to accelerate GDP growth to 8 per cent and propel the country towards a $5-trillion economy by 2030.

""The overarching focus of the strategy document is to further improve the policy environment in which private investors and other stakeholders can contribute their fullest towards achieving the goals set out for New India 2022 and propel India towards a $5-trillion economy by 2030,"" it said.

Serbia's reforms 'broadly on track', IMF says - Times of India

","
BELGRADE: Serbia's economic performance was strong in 2018 and the government remains committed to progress on reforms next year, the IMF said on Friday, completing its first review of a non-financial arrangement with Belgrade.


Serbia, the largest of the six ex-Yugoslav republics, has seen its economy start to recover in the past three years after years of decline due to wars and isolation in the 1990s, followed by the 2008 global financial crisis.

In October, the IMF raised Serbia's 2018 growth forecast to 4.2 percent from 3.5 percent, citing ""dramatic"" economic improvement, but forecast growth dropping to 3.5 percent in 2019 as low-base effects wane.

In a statement, the International Monetary Fund's Executive Board said Serbia continued to implement provisions of the non-financial Policy Coordination Instrument, which are tailored for countries that do not need the IMF's financial backing.

Serbia, whose three-year 1.2 billion euros ($1.37 billion) loan deal with the fund ended in February, needs the current non-financial arrangement to assure investors.

""Serbia’s strong economic performance continues, supported by the recovery of private consumption and robust foreign direct investments and exports ... Program implementation is broadly on track,"" the IMF statement said.

In October, Belgrade and the IMF agreed over a 2019 fiscal deficit target of 0.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Serbia is expected to end 2018 with a small surplus.

The fund said that Serbia's 2019 budget safeguards fiscal adjustment made in recent years and foresees a further decline in public debt, while accommodating higher investments and unwinding of crisis-era austerity measures.

Serbian inflation fell to 1.9 percent in November from 2.2 percent a month earlier, inside the central bank's target of 3 percent, give or take 1.5 percentage points.

Serbian authorities are committed to making progress on reforms in 2019 to foster private sector-led growth and ensure the country is bound for faster convergence with income levels of the European Union that it wants to join, the IMF said.

Iran banks oil imports: Government plans to pay five Iranian banks for oil imports - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: India will deposit payments for crude oil imported from Iran into escrow accounts of five of their banks held with state-run UCO Bank Ltd after the two nations agreed on a payment mechanism to overcome US sanctions, according to people with knowledge of the matter.


Iran will use part of the deposits for purchasing essential goods from India and to meet expenditure incurred by its diplomatic missions in the South Asian nation, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information isn’t public. 

  All spending will be in Indian rupees.
 +

Continued supplies is crucial for India, a country that imports nearly 80 per cent of its annual crude requirement, as Tehran offers better credit terms than other Middle East oil producers and, in the past, has accepted payments in rupees, rather than US dollars. India purchased crude worth about $9 billion from Iran in the financial year ended March 31.

The payment mechanism will allow India to continue oil purchases despite sanctions as it fulfills US President Donald Trump’s goal to choke money going directly to Iran. Washington has also granted an exemption for India. Refiners such as Indian Oil Corp and Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd will make payments after the mechanism is officially notified, the people said.


Spreading risk

Also, payment into multiple escrow accounts will reduce the risks of Iranian bank accounts being frozen in case the US brings new banks under sanctions, the people said.

“We already have 15 Iranian bank accounts, out of these five have come under secondary sanctions,” UCO Bank managing director Atul Kumar Goel said on Tuesday, adding that the remaining 10 are eligible for bilateral trade between India and Iran. Finance ministry spokesman DS Malik declined to comment.

India and Iran followed a similar mechanism previously when the US imposed sanctions in 2012. At that time, 45 per cent of the dues were paid into escrow accounts in India of Iranian banks and the remaining settled in euros through an overseas bank.



India didn't let Russian-owned refinery buy Iranian oil: Iran ministerBijan Zanganeh was responding to a question in an interview on Iranian state television about why Iran had not bought refineries overseas. He said large investments were needed, and the refineries would be under the jurisdiction of the host country.


“This will help UCO Bank boost its CASA and profitability,” Goel said, referring to the low-cost deposits. During the previous sanctions also, UCO Bank was solely holding the payments for Iranian oil, that swelled the state-run lender’s profit to highest on-record in fiscal year 2013-14. The bank has been reporting losses since Iran sanctions were lifted in 2015.

Shares of UCO Bank gained as much as 6.9 per cent in Mumbai on Wednesday before paring the gains to 4.1 per cent at 11:01 am. The stock finally settled 4.9 per cent up.

Now, Iran will use the money to import goods ranging from food to medicines and settle the dues in rupees. It will also draw money from these accounts to pay all costs, including rentals, salaries and other administrative expenses of its missions in India, they said.

Under the exemptions granted last month, US allowed India to import as much as 300,000 barrels a day of Iranian oil for 180 days. That’s less than Iran’s average daily exports to the nation of about 540,000 barrels this year, and almost 450,000 barrels in 2017, shipping data compiled by Bloomberg show.

Exports to Iran stood at $2.65 billion during the last financial year, including rice, spices, tea, yarn, medicines and various industrial products, according to India’s directorate general of commercial intelligence and statistics, an arm of ministry of commerce and industry.

Apple upstages Amazon in selecting new tech hub locations - Times of India

","
AUSTIN: One tech giant strung dozens of North American cities through a circus-like contest that led mayors and governors to desperately pitch their regions - and offer huge sums of public money - in hopes of landing a gleaming new corporate campus. The other swept in quietly before making its big move.



 The outcome was largely the same: Amazon and Apple are running out of room in their West Coast hometowns and establishing a major foothold in a handful of U.S. cities already known as second-tier technology hubs.

 But this week, at least, Apple may have won the prize for completing its search with the fewest hurt feelings.

 Apple announced plans Thursday to build a $1 billion campus in Austin, Texas, that will create at least 5,000 jobs ranging from engineers to call-center agents while adding more luster to a city that has already become a destination for tech startups and bigger companies.

 The decision comes 11 months after Apple CEO Tim Cook disclosed plans to open a major office outside California on the heels of a massive tax cut on overseas profits, which prompted the company to bring about $250 billion back to the U.S.

 The company said it will also open offices in Seattle, San Diego and Culver City, California, each employing at least 1,000 workers over the next three years. Apple also pledged to add hundreds of jobs each in New York; Pittsburgh; Boston; Boulder, Colorado; and Portland, Oregon.

 ""They are just picking America's most established superstar cities and tech hubs,"" said Richard Florida, an urban development expert at the University of Toronto.

 Apple's scattershot expansion reflects the increasing competition for engineers in Silicon Valley, which has long been the world's high-tech capital. The bidding for programmers is driving salaries higher, which in turn is catapulting the average prices of homes in many parts of the San Francisco Bay Area above $1 million. Many high-tech workers are thus choosing to live elsewhere, causing major tech employers such as Apple, Amazon and Google to look in new places for the employees they need to pursue their future ambitions.

 ""Talent, creativity and tomorrow's breakthrough ideas aren't limited by region or ZIP code,"" Cook said in a statement.

 Cities around the country offered financial incentives in an attempt to land Apple's new campus, but Cook avoided a high-profile competition that pitted them against one another, as Amazon had before deciding to build huge new offices in New York and Virginia.

 Amazon could receive up to $2.8 billion in incentives in New York, depending on how many it ultimately hires there, and up to $750 million in Virginia. Apple will receive up to $25 million from a jobs-creation fund in Texas in addition to property-tax rebates, which still need approval. The figure is expected to be a small fraction of what Amazon received.

 The government incentives offered to Apple seem ""more in the line of normal business site selection"" compared with Amazon's public ""shakedown,"" said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Center.

 ""There's a growing backlash in the country against the entire process of subsidies and relocation inducements,"" Muro said. ""That said, the Apple numbers for a very significant increase in jobs are much less eye-popping than the Amazon numbers.""

 The spots where Amazon and Apple decided to expand were obvious choices, based on an analysis released earlier this year by CBRE Research. Washington, D.C., ranked as the third best place in North America for tech talent, behind Silicon Valley and Seattle. New York ranked fifth and Austin sixth. No. 4 was outside the U.S.: Toronto.

 The new Austin campus, with about 3 million square feet (nearly 280,000 square meters) of office space, will be about a mile from another large office that Apple opened five years ago. Apple currently employs about 6,200 workers in Austin, making it the company's largest hub outside Silicon Valley even before the expansion.

 The new jobs are expected to mirror the same mix Apple already has at its Cupertino, California, headquarters, ranging from jobs in technology and research that pay well over $100,000 to lower-paying positions in customer call centers.

 Cities have been eager to bring in more tech employers because their hires often make six-figure salaries. That can ripple through the economy, with new employees filling restaurants and theaters, buying property and paying taxes.

 But an influx of affluent tech workers can also drive up rent and home prices, making it more difficult for those in lower-paying jobs to make ends meet.

 ""When tech companies invest in a place and try to hire thousands of workers, it is of course good news for tech workers who are already there and want to be there,"" said Jed Kolko, chief economist for employment website Indeed.com. ""But it can put a strain on the housing market and transportation.""

 Texas Gov. Greg Abbott hailed Apple's new campus as a milestone development that ""truly elevates Austin as one of the premier technology hubs in the entire world.""

Airtel 

","
NEW DELHI: The telecom sector could see subscriptions drop by up to 60 million in the next six months or so as customers increasingly discard multiple SIM cards from different operators in favour of one, driven by similar tariffs plans and services. 

Industry executives and analysts said minimum recharge plans recently introduced by second-ranked Bharti Airtel and market leader Vodafone Idea for low-value users have set a floor on pricing, bringing them almost at par with latest entrant Reliance Jio’s minimum tariff plan. This will further push customers to choose one of the three, they said. 

This would bring down the overall subscriber base from nearly 1.2 billion recorded at August end, while the number of those with new SIM – or unique subscribers – will rise a bit, reflecting some with new connections. Of the overall base, some 730-750 million currently are unique customers, or single SIM holders. The rest hold two SIMs. 

“There will be a 25-30 million drop in subscriber numbers in the next six months which in this case translates to number of connections being given up. This is because of the SIM consolidation that is taking place,” said Rajan Mathews, director general of Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), which represents all three private telcos. 

An analyst, who did not want to be identified, though, expects the next two quarters to see 15-20% churn, which is some 45-60 million connections. 

“Customers used dual SIMs to take advantage of difference in price points and quality of services across geographies. Now that both price and service quality are similar across operators, need for multiple connections is no longer critical,” said Hemant M Joshi, partner, technology, media and telecommunications, at Deloitte India. 

The shift to one SIM will be good for the industry as telcos can see actual penetration levels and strategise their expansion plans accordingly, Joshi added. 

To ensure customers remain active and keep billing, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea recently introduced packs with minimum recharges of Rs 35, Rs 65 and Rs 95 with a 28-day validity period. This means that users who do not recharge their plans would see outgoing calls blocked in a month and incoming ones in 45 days. The minimum plans for both telcos now compare with Jio’s minimum Rs 49 recharge plan for JioPhone users, forcing subscribers to make a choice. 

The aim of the telcos is to get customers to generate revenue and not remain connected without getting billed, which will help their average revenue per user (ARPU) — a key industry parameter — which has declined sharply over the last two years due to brutal price competition. 

“This strategy leading to SIM consolidation will also weed out lower ARPU customers and with stability when prices increase, the minimum amount recharges will go up as well,” said another analyst, who did not want to be identified. 

Sanjay Kapoor, former chief executive of Bharti Airtel (India), said the more important index will be to watch the growth in unique data subscribers. He added that the expansion of 4G will “decimate SIM multiplicity” as a 4G slot can take only one SIM, which will be “accretive” to the industry. 

Gopal Vittal, chief executive of Bharti Airtel, said at a post-earnings call that he expects “prepaid ARPU to start improving by the fiscal third quarter onwards on account of the minimum recharge plans, which should also lead to a reduction in the company’s selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses”.

Drugmaker GSK to split after folding in Pfizer consumer unit - Times of India

","
LONDON: GlaxoSmithKline plans to split into two businesses -- one for prescription drugs and vaccines, the other for over-the-counter products -- after forming a new joint venture with Pfizer's consumer health division.


The revamp is the boldest move yet by chief executive Emma Walmsley, who took over last year.

She has previously played down the idea of breaking up the group, something that a number of investors have called for over the years.

On Wednesday, however, Walmsley announced that GSK and Pfizer would combine their consumer health businesses in a joint venture with sales of 9.8 billion pounds ($12.7 billion), 68 per cent-owned by the British company, in an all-equity transaction.

GSK said the deal laid the foundation for the creation of two new UK-based global companies focused on pharma/vaccines and consumer healthcare within three years of the transaction closing.

For Pfizer, the deal resolves the issue of what to do with its consumer health division, which includes Advil painkillers and Centrum vitamins, after an abortive attempt to sell it outright earlier this year.

The new joint venture with Pfizer is expected to generate total annual cost savings of 500 million pounds by 2022 for expected total cash costs of 900 million and non-cash charges of 300 million. GSK plans divestments of some 1 billion pounds.

In a bid to reassure investors of its financial strength, GSK extended its guarantee on the dividend by stating it expected to pay unchanged dividends of 80 pence per share for 2019.

Government orders telcos’ audit, suspects under-reporting of revenues - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: At a time when the telecom industry is facing a severe financial distress, the government is understood to have ordered a comprehensive audit of their financial filings on suspicion of under-reporting of revenues.


The government, which gains revenues from the sector as a percentage of their adjusted gross revenues (AGR), feels that not all may be well when it comes to reporting of financial figures by the top telecom companies.

Those under the scanner, as per sources, include Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular (who have merged their businesses now), Tata Tele (who has exited the telecom business), and new entrant Reliance Jio.




“Six auditors are expected to be appointed by the first week of January, and we are hopeful of completing the exercise over the next nine-month period,” the source said.

In July last year, CAG said in a report that under-reporting of revenues was done through accounting adjustments for commission or discount paid by the companies to their distributors, promotional schemes like free talk-time and discounts to post-paid subscribers and on roaming services.

The revenue was also understated by netting of revenue from infrastructure sharing and non-inclusion of forex gains, interest income and sale of investment, CAG had said.

Sources said the telecom ministry will be issuing notices to the companies as the audit process gets underway.

As per the telecom policy, mobile operators are required to share a percentage of their AGR with the government as annual licence fee. This comes to nearly 8% now. In addition, mobile telephone operators are also required to pay Spectrum Usage Charges (SUC) to the government for the use of radio frequency spectrum allotted to them.

CAG said the gross revenue of the licensee operator, as per the agreement with the Department of Telecom, prohibits any set-offs of related expenditure from revenue and norms for preparation of the accounts for payment of revenue share are built into the licence agreement.

New Facebook bug may have exposed unposted photos - Times of India

","
SAN FRANCISCO: Facebook apologized on Friday for a ""bug"" that may have exposed unposted photos from as many as 6.8 million users over a 12-day period through third-party applications.


In the latest in a string of incidents on data protection, the leading social network said using Facebook login and granting permission to third-party apps to access photos may have led to the unintended lapse between September 13 and 25.

""When someone gives permission for an app to access their photos on Facebook, we usually only grant the app access to photos people share on their timeline,"" engineering director Tomer Bar said in a message to developers.

""In this case, the bug potentially gave developers access to other photos, such as those shared on Marketplace or Facebook Stories."" Bar added that the bug also impacted photos that people uploaded to Facebook but chose not to post -- in situations where someone uploads a photo but doesn't finish posting it, for example.

""We store a copy of that photo so the person has it when they come back to the app to complete their post,"" he said.

Bar said affected users would be notified and directed to a help center where they will be able to see what images may have been affected.

""We're sorry this happened,"" he said. ""Early next week we will be rolling out tools for app developers that will allow them to determine which people using their app might be impacted by this bug. We will be working with those developers to delete the photos from impacted users.""

Facebook has been facing heightened scrutiny over its data protection practices in recent months, notably since the revelations over hijacking of personal data of tens of millions of users by Cambridge Analytica, a consultancy working on Donald Trump's 2016 campaign.

DoT mulling easing spectrum trading norms, transfer of network equipment - Times of India

","
New Delhi, Dec 21 () The Department of Telecom is considering easing spectrum trading rules as part of steps suggested by a committee to resolve financial stress in the sector, Union minister Manoj Sinha said Friday.  An inter-ministerial group (IMG) formed to recommend measures to resolve financial stress in the telecom sector had suggested that the DoT may issue appropriate clarification that only the gain or profit arising from the trade of spectrum shall constitute as part of revenue for the purpose of calculation of AGR.  ""The Telecom Commission directed that the Department may obtain legal opinion whether such an amendment can be made to the guidelines. A legal opinion was sought and as per legal advice, TRAI recommendations were obtained. The matter was then referred to the Ministry of Finance and comments were obtained. The case is presently under examination in the Department,"" Sinha informed the Rajya Sabha.  Based on recommendations of the IMG, the government has already given a one-time opportunity to telecom operators to opt for a higher number of instalments (16) instead of the currently permitted 10 instalments for making payment of spectrum which they have procured in auctions.  Sinha said that DoT is working on the recommendations of the IMG to permit telecom service providers to transfer wireless equipment between licensees and service areas on the basis of intimation only.  Besides these measures, the telecom ministry is also working on doing away with import licences that are required to be obtained from the DoT, Sinha said.  The IMG submitted its report on August 31, 2017, in which it noted that the financial stress in the sector has been caused because of low operating cash flows over a number of years, inadequate equity infusion and debt which does not appear sustainable.  ""IMG also observed that the increased competition in the sector and the entry of a new operator led to free promotional offers leading to a downward trend of tariffs,"" Sinha said.  PRS MR MR"

Rupee rallies 69 paise, settles below 70-mark - Times of India

MUMBAI: The rupee strengthened further by 69 paise to close at 69.70 against the US dollar Thursday as the Fed raised the interest rate but lowered its projection for future hikes.


Tumbling crude oil prices and sustained selling of the greenback by exporters and banks gave further impetus to the local unit, forex dealers said.

US fed rake hike: US Fed raises interest rates, 4th time this year - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: After weeks of market volatility and calls by President Donald Trump for the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates, the US central bank instead did it again, and stuck by a plan to keep withdrawing support from an economy it views as strong.

US stocks and bond yields fell hard. With the Fed signaling ""some further gradual"" rate hikes and no break from cutting its massive bond portfolio, traders fretted that policymakers could choke off economic growth.

""Maybe they have already committed their policy error,"" said Fritz Folts, chief investment strategist at 3Edge Asset Management. ""We would be in the camp that they have already raised rates too much.""

Interest rate futures show traders are currently betting the Fed won't raise rates at all next year.

Wednesday's rate increase, the fourth of the year, pushed the central bank's key overnight lending rate to a range of 2.25 percent to 2.50 percent.

In a news conference after the release of the policy statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank would continue trimming its balance sheet by $50 billion each month, and left open the possibility that continued strong data could force it to raise rates to the point where they start to brake the economy's momentum.

Powell did bow to what he called recent ""softening"" in global growth, tighter financial conditions, and expectations the US economy will slow next year, and said that with inflation expected to remain a touch below the Fed's 2 percent target next year, policymakers can be ""patient.""

Fresh economic forecasts showed officials at the median now see only two more rate hikes next year compared to the three projected in September.

But another message was clear in the statement issued after the Fed's last policy meeting of the year as well as in Powell's comments: The US economy continues to perform well and no longer needs the Fed's support either through lower-than-normal interest rates or by maintaining of a massive balance sheet.

""Policy does not need to be accommodative,"" he said.

In its statement, the Fed said risks to the economy were ""roughly balanced"" but that it would ""continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook.""

The Fed also made a widely expected technical adjustment, raising the rate it pays on banks' excess reserves by just 20 basis points to give it better control over the policy rate and keep it within the targeted range.


Choppy waters

The decision to raise borrowing costs again is likely to anger Trump, who has repeatedly attacked the central bank's tightening this year as damaging to the economy.

The Fed has been raising rates to reduce the boost that monetary policy gives to the economy, which is growing faster than what central bank policymakers view as a sustainable rate.

There are worries, however, that the economy could enter choppy waters next year as the fiscal boost from the Trump administration's spending and $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades and the global economy slows.

""I think that markets were looking for more in terms of the pause,"" said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia.

""It's not as dovish as expected, but I do believe the Fed will ultimately back off even further as we move into the new year.""

The benchmark S&P 500 index tumbled to a 15-month low, extending a streak of volatility that has dogged the market since late September. The index is down nearly 15 percent from its record high.

Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields fell as low as 2.75 percent, the lowest since April 4.


Economic projections

Fed policymakers' median forecast puts the federal funds rate at 3.1 percent at the end of 2020 and 2021, according to the projections.

That would leave borrowing costs just above policymakers' newly downgraded median view of a 2.8 percent neutral rate that neither brakes nor boosts a healthy economy, but still within the 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent range of Fed estimates for that rate.

Powell parried three questions about whether the Fed intended to restrict the economy with its rate policy, but gave little away.

""There would be circumstances in which it would be appropriate for us to go past neutral, and there would be circumstances in which it would be wholly inappropriate to do so.""

Gross domestic product is forecast to grow 2.3 percent next year and 2.0 percent in 2020, slightly weaker than the Fed previously anticipated. The unemployment rate, currently at a 49-year low of 3.7 percent, is expected to fall to 3.5 percent next year and rise slightly in 2020 and 2021.

Inflation, which hit the central bank's 2 percent target this year, is expected to be 1.9 percent next year, a bit lower than the 2.0 percent forecast three months ago.

There were no dissents in the Fed's policy decision.

Centre likely to renew demand for extra dividend from RBI: Sources - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Central government will likely renew its demand for Rs 131.40 billion ($1.9 billion) in additional dividend from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) helmed by newly-appointed governor Shaktikanta Das, two sources in the government told Reuters.


The government believes the amount has been pending since 2016-17, when they used an internal formula called staggered surplus dividend distribution method without consulting the government to transfer the dividend for that year, said one of the sources, who did not want to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media.

""Even though RBI in 2016-17 used their own formula it had still transferred Rs 131.40 billion less to the government in our view,"" the official said. ""We have been asking that amount to be given to us,"" the official added.

The central bank announced the transfer of Rs 500 billion in dividend to the federal government for this fiscal year in August. The government submitted a note to the RBI later that month pointing to the shortfall, said one of the sources who had seen it.

Both sources said the finance ministry was likely to combine the amount sought for this year and the pending sum from 2016-17 when it makes a formal request next month.

The finance ministry and the RBI did not respond to requests for comment. RBI officials have in the past said that reserves are an important measure of the central bank's ability to withstand any major market volatility and, therefore, should not be reduced.

Heated discussions over the revamping of the economic capital framework was one of the reasons behind the sudden resignation of Urijit Patel earlier this month.

The government has been sparring with the RBI on deciding a fixed formula for transferring dividend to the government as it believes the central bank currently uses an ""arbitrary"" method.

The government wants to set a clear formula for transfer of the funds as the calculation of fiscal deficit and expenditures can be upset if the amount of transfer is lower-than-expected.

New Delhi not only wants to have a clear dividend-sharing policy with the central bank but is also looking to revamp the entire economic capital framework as it believes the current framework is ""extremely conservative.""

If the government is successful in convincing the RBI of a less conservative framework, then trillions of rupees could be freed up for government use, according to the second source, who also did not want to be named.

Such funds will be crucial to the Narendra Modi-led government, who will look to lure voters by giving tax rebates, increasing allocation towards rural schemes and spending on subsidies ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

Foreign banks: Why Indian companies' dependence on foreign banks rising - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: India’s companies are growing more dependent on banks to raise offshore funds going into 2019 as the bond markets sputter and local-currency funding from domestic banks dries up.


Borrowers that are facing challenges in the credit market are finding solace in dollar-denominated loans, even as non-performing debt at local banks, volatility in the rupee and uncertainty over national elections next year add to pressure on financing costs.

The downfall of shadow lender IL&FS group has fueled concerns about default risks, making banks cautious and pushing up the cost some firms pay for loans at home. Companies are increasingly turning to overseas lenders, as distressed assets of about $210 billion at India’s banks limit their capacity to lend rupee funds.



IL&FS to auction road assets worth Rs 25,000-30,000 croreThe seven operating annuity projects include the 9.28km Chenani-Nashri Tunnelway (CNTL), also known as the Patni Top Tunnel, which was inaugurated by the Prime Minister last year and is India’s longest road tunnel. The CNTL project, which has Rs 4,200 crore of term loans and external commercial borrowing, is contractually entitled to receive semi-annuities of Rs 318 crore in September and March every year till the end of the concession period. 


“Many issuers are looking at offshore loans due to low liquidity in the rupee debt markets,” said Durgesh Tinaikar, head of corporate and institutional banking at Mizuho Bank India. “Borrowers find offshore loans easier to raise funds, even though pricing is largely on an upward trend, mainly for banks and non-banking finance companies, due to political uncertainty and risks for volatility in the rupee.”


Borrowing cost trends

The big picture is that loan costs are heading up for some borrowers, but had fallen so much earlier that they are still lower this year on average. Average margins on Indian five-year foreign-currency loans are 130 basis points more than London interbank offered rate in 2018, the lowest since 2005, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. In comparison, spreads over Treasuries for dollar bonds of local issuers have risen 109 basis points this year to 275, according to ICE BofAML index data.


Recent Examples

Some Indian companies are stomaching the recent uptick in loan rates. State Bank of India, the nation’s biggest lender, is paying a margin of 115 basis points over Libor for its new $500 million five-year loan, 10 basis points higher than its similar-tenor facility in 2017. Indian Oil Corp is offering 100 basis point margin on a $1.3 billion five-year loan, compared with 70 basis points on the refiner’s $300 million loan with the same tenor from a year ago.


Insights

“Some of the non-bank financial institutions and smaller banks in India have had some credit risk problems,” said John Corrin, global head of loan syndications at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group in Hong Kong. “Some of the companies are strong and will continue to have access to the foreign market, while others are less so and definitely will struggle to raise funds or will have to pay significantly more.” In the bond market, credit rating downgrades have weighed on sentiment toward some borrowers.

Vedanta chairman: ‘Government must realise making money no sin’ - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Vedanta group chairman Anil Agarwal says the government should give more priority to ensuring policy and regulatory certainty. He tells TOI that the government should open up mining faster and make PSUs autonomous. Edited excerpts:



There was a setback for you in Tuticorin and mining business in Goa is suffering from uncertainty. You were told that you will have the right to acquire the remaining government stake in Hindustan Zinc and Balco, which has not happened after so many years. Is there enough certainty of policy in India?

Before you start (business), you are putting (them) on crutches. It will take a couple of years to come back to the same level of production. Whatever happens, production should not stop. Three lakh people are suffering due to what happened in Goa. It wasn’t a problem that could not be solved. The government has to put these things on top priority — may be it is priority number 20, how can you make it number 2? We have to show to the world that we are a strong government and we will not allow any vested interest to interfere in our progress.


These are policy issues, which have not been addressed…

The government must realise that making money should not be a sin. All over the world, people make money, companies make money and re-invest. If you see any democratic country, no government runs business. Every government said the government has no business being in business. That’s true — it should remain on the top, collect revenue, make sure governance is followed and regulators do proper regulation. It does not mean you give business to Anil Agarwal, it should be the way L&T and HDFC Bank are run. The way GE, Exxon and BP are running, our public sector can run with autonomy, owned by the shareholder, with a condition you cannot retrench people.


When this government came to power, it promised certainty of regulations and things like disinvestment but things haven’t fully worked out that way. Did you expect more?

Definitely, I expect more. But what they have done with GST is fantastic. It has delivered on IBC — people used to take money from banks, and not repay, that is gone.


Which are the areas where more should be done?

How they can increase production of public sector is very important. Coal mining, iron ore, bauxite mining should be given to private people. It’s not that they do not want to, it has not taken shape.


Why is your group always under scrutiny?

I don’t think that is the case. In fact, we are the biggest tax payer. As far as we are concerned, we are very law abiding people.


Then, why do people keep raising protest flags?

We are the only people who are in natural resources. We are the only people who are advising against imports all the time. We have received several awards for environment. We are worldwide and everybody likes to invest with us.


What is your strategy going to be as a group?

We are in five businesses — oil and gas, aluminium, zinc, copper, iron and steel. We are going to invest about Rs 60,000 crore to double capacity. Our revenue will increase from $16 billion to $25-26 billion. We expect each business to contribute equally.


Are you looking at acquiring more companies through the IBC route?

Our hands are full but we will look at it if any good opportunity comes. If the government undertakes any privatization or anything comes, we’ll look at it.

Import Duty Hike: India again defers duty hike on US products till January 31 

","
NEW DELHI: India for the fourth time deferred the deadline to impose retaliatory customs duties on 29 US products, including almond, walnut and pulses, by another 45 days, the government has said. According to a notification by the finance ministry, the implementation of the duty hike has been postponed until January 31, 2019. 


 The commerce ministry had asked its finance counterpart to extend the deadline further. 

 In June, India decided to impose retaliatory tariffs from August 4. But it was extended by 45 days till September 18 and then till November 2. In November, the decision to impose these duties was deferred till December 17. 

 As part of imposition of higher import duties, New Delhi has notified higher tariffs on several products. While import duty on walnut is to be hiked to 120 per cent from 30 per cent at present, duty on chickpeas, Bengal gram (chana) and masur dal will be raised to 70 per cent, from 30 per cent currently. Levy on lentils will be increased to 40 per cent, from 30 per cent. 

 The duty hike move by India was in retaliation to US President Donald Trump's March 9 decision to impose heavy tariffs on imported steel and aluminium items. 

 Senior officials of India and the US are in discussions to finalise a kind of trade deal. Both sides are holding two track discussions -- to increase trade in short and medium term, and identify long-term trade potentials. 

 India is pressing for exemption from high duty imposed by the US on certain steel and aluminium products, resumption of export benefits to certain domestic products under their generalised system of preferences (GSP), greater market access for its products from agriculture, automobile, automobile components and engineering sectors. 

 On the other hand, the US is demanding greater market access through cut in import duties for its agriculture goods, dairy products, medical devices, IT and communication items, the official added. 

 India's exports to the US in 2017-18 stood at $47.9 billion, while imports were $26.7 billion. The trade balance is in favour of India. 

 Commerce and industry minister Suresh Prabhu will hold bilateral discussions on trade issues with US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on February 14 here.

Advise social media platforms to put in place system for tracking fake messages: FSSAI to MeitY - Times of India

","
New Delhi, Dec 21 () Food safety regulator FSSAI has requested the IT ministry to ensure social media platforms put in place a mechanism to track fake messages with regard to safety and quality of food products, Parliament was informed Friday. In a written reply to Rajya Sabha, Electronics and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said FSSAI, in a November 27 letter, expressed concern over circulation of false and malicious videos on various social media platforms regarding the safety and quality of food available in the country.  Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has requested the ministry to ""sensitise"" social media platforms on the large-scale implications of such false propaganda, Prasad said. The regulator has also asked the ministry to advise social media platforms to put in place a system for tracking of messages so that such mischievous perpetrators could be brought to book and penal action can be initiated against them, he added. Prasad said the government has taken several steps to target such fake videos and messages to take action against people for circulating such false content. The minister said the government has already issued a notice to messaging platform WhatsApp in July this year on spread of fake news through its platform. WhatsApp, in its response, has conveyed a number of steps that it has taken to address the issue of fake news. The government has been asking the Facebook-owned company to put in place a mechanism to curb fake messages on its platform, that incited mob fury earlier this year. More than a dozen people were killed across India this year in mob lynchings, fuelled by rumours circulated on WhatsApp. The rumours ranged from suspicion of stealing children to victims being believed to be killing cows. Riots were instigated by people forwarding and misinterpreting videos on WhatsApp. ""Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) and Ministry of Home Affairs as well as police are in regular touch with various social media platforms to effectively address the issue of removal of objectionable content,"" he said.

Sunil Mittal: Why telecom is certainly not tobacco 

","
NEW DELHI: Airtel’s founder chairperson Sunil Bharti Mittal took to hyperbole and misinformation when he claimed at an industry event that telecom is being taxed like tobacco in India; he was explaining his company’s poor financial performance for the second quarter ended September 30.


Airtel's net profit fell for the tenth straight quarter, down 65.4 per cent (year-on-year), as losses on India business widened due to pricing pressure from aggressive competition.


What Mittal had said: Speaking at the inaugural session of India Mobile Congress 2018, Mittal, rued that the telecom sector remains highly taxed just like the tobacco industry, when it is contributing to India's digital aspirations.

""In India, for every Rs 100 that mobile operators earn, nearly Rs 37 goes towards one form of levy or the other. I cannot see how this contradiction can exist...where on one hand we have PM's vision of digitally enabled India ...which requires tremendous amount of investment, on the other hand we keep the spectrum prices and our licence fee very high...and of course the GST is at 18 per cent which almost at the highest tax bracket,"" Mittal said.

According to Mittal’s own calculation, telecom companies pay less than 20 per cent as tax on their earnings. But compare that to cigarettes, the largest selling tobacco product, which are taxed nearly 55 per cent on each stick.


A different bracket: Contrary to the Airtel top honcho’s lament that taxes on telecom are among the highest GST slab, they are a distant second to the highest GST slab of 28 per cent levied on cigarettes — telecom attracts a GST rate of 18 per cent, with an added benefit of input tax credit on capex (capital expenditure).


Competition: It’s not so much the taxes that resulted in a 65 per cent drop in Airtel’s earnings for the second quarter but a bruising tariff war with new entrant Reliance Jio and newly-merged Vodafone-Idea, which has pipped Airtel as India’s largest telecom operator. Airtel’s ARPU has declined nearly 29 per cent year-on-year for the second quarter.

'India very price sensitive market, hiking fares leads to losing flyers to other carriers' - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Indian Airlines are witnessing “profit-less” growth with fares being 10-15% below break-even levels. And the market is so price-sensitive that if one airline tries to hike fares by even Rs 200, the demand immediately shifts to “cheaper” options and the former’s losses would mount due to fall in sales caused by its raising ticket price!


This was how Dinesh Keskar, Boeing’s senior VP (Asia Pacific & India Sales), diagnosed the situation of Indian airlines — many of whom are struggling to survive — while giving the US aircraft major’s 20-year “commercial market outlook” (CMO) here on Wednesday. “India is the world’s fastest-growing aviation market and has seen 50 consecutive months of double-digit growth. The country will need 2,300 new planes worth $320 billion over the next two decades, of which 1,940 will be single-aisle, 350 wide body and 10 regional jets (that does not include below 60-seater turboprops),” Keskar said.

However, despite the growth, Indian carriers are far from being profitable with even consistently money-making low-cost IndiGo declaring a big loss in the last quarter. Keskar attributed this to high costs due to expensive fuel prices and the recent depreciation of the rupee vis-a-vis the dollar. On the other hand, fares charged by Indian carriers do not reflect the high costs.

“Mumbai-Delhi one-way fare is about $45-50. Similar distance San Francisco-Seattle route fares is 3-4 times higher. That is why airlines in the US and Europe are profitable. In India, fares are 10-15% lower than break even levels. I asked airlines why don’t they shed some growth by hiking fares to recover costs. They showed in real time that hiking fares by even Rs 200 meant losing prospective travellers to other cheaper airlines. Unless airlines as a whole have pricing discipline, it is not possible for a single airline to recover fares that cover costs as India is a very price sensitive market,” Keskar, who knows the India market very well, said.

Giving an example, he said his rich and prosperous Indian professional acquaintances in the US often tell him that they bought their return ticket to India at $970 and later the fares fell to $950. “They ask me if I can help them get their $970-ticket cancelled so that they can buy the $20 cheaper one. This is how price sensitive we are,” he said.

Rating agency ICRA recently said the three listed Indian carriers — Jet Airways, IndiGo and SpiceJet — lost Rs 20 crore per day in April-September, 2018, period. Collectively, Indian Airlines are likely to lose over Rs 8,800 crore in FY 2019, ICRA had estimated.
While the industry is in deep red, Indian low-cost carriers now dominate the market. “64% or two-thirds of air travel in India is on the low-cost carriers. The budget airlines are looking at one-stop medium to long routes. Our Boeing 737Max, that Jet and SpiceJet have on order, allows them to fly up to Cairo, Istanbul, Moscow, Tokyo, Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur due to its increased range,” he added.

financial planning: Talk money without fights - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: My friends indulge in frequent arguments. It is tough to agree on money matters in a household. Osho would make a beautiful case for why agreement should not be a goal in marriage. However, little everyday decisions and significant life changing ones require joint effort. Even if a consensus cannot be reached between husband and wife, at least the willingness to cooperate is needed. So how can we make decisions about money somewhat less combative?


First, it makes sense to allocate money as his, hers and ours. Except for a few exceptional cases where a common pool of money is easily used without complaint by both parties, earmarking is a good idea. It is much better practice to let the other spend a portion of income freely.

Second, the contribution to the common pool should be based on agreed principles and budgets. A friend used her salary to run the household and pay EMIs, while the husband used his income to save and invest. Unfortunately the marriage ended and she was left to argue in court for her share of assets. It is much better to hold assets jointly.

Third, do not strive for consensus on every little money decision. Identify the triggers for most arguments and sort it out. A friend’s wife was addicted to trading. Since the retired husband was worried about this, they agreed to earmark a specific amount drawn from her VRS proceeds for the purpose. She also agreed to trade within that capital.

Fourth, some couples skip the discussion on money out of pure denial of their monetary status. These households struggle with the social conditioning that the husband should play the superman provider, and the men’s pride does not let them disclose that money is short. Such attitudes can be harmful. Family members should know that money is a limited resource, and making the spending decision a family effort is also a good way to involve children.

Fifth, there is no easy way to arrive at a consensus about where to invest. So, it is helpful to see differences as contributing towards the asset allocation decisions of the family’s wealth, rather than have all investments cater to a specific preference. The household can decide to have its wealth in every kind of asset, from property, gold and FD to stocks and funds, and allocate the management of these assets according to the preferences of the members, annually reviewing the proportions invested in each. The overall wealth should do well with this variety.

Problems in household finances arise from quarrels over opportunity costs. There is no agreeing on issues, identifying them as problem areas and finding ways to manage them can help. Allowing the freedom and space to make decisions within an allocated amount has worked for many couples. Investing the goodwill of relationship in assuaging fears and insecurities is a better approach than struggling to achieve agreement on every decision.

Airtel, Vodafone Idea improve revenue in metros: Report - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Telecom operators Airtel and Vodafone have shown some recovery in terms of revenue in metro cities during the September quarter, while Reliance Jio gained strength in a majority of telecom circles, according to analyst reports on revenue data published by telecom regulator Trai. 


Research firm UBS observed that revenue of companies from telecom services or adjusted gross revenue (AGR) declined by 0.7 per cent quarter on a quarterly basis and down by 15.4 per cent year-on-year basis. 

ICICI Securities market share tracker report said the industry AGR dipped to Rs 32,000 crore due to seasonality and downgrades in postpaid category. 

""Bharti and VIL (Vodafone India Limited) showed a recovery in metros with Bharti gaining share in metros although Jio's momentum in other circles remains strong,"" report by UBS analysts Navin Killa, Amit Rustagi and Ankit Dubey said. 

Airtel's base market share for access services or mobile and landline services with national long distance services stood at 30.1 per cent while that of Jio was at 26.1 per cent. Vodafone Idea topped the revenue market share with 32.8 per cent. 

Reliance Jio has emerged as the top telecom service provider in terms of AGR at Rs 8,271 crore for the July-September quarter for access services 

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's (Trai) latest data showed that newly merged Vodafone Idea recorded an AGR -- earnings from mobile phone services -- of Rs 7,528 crore, followed by Bharti Airtel at the third position with an AGR market share of Rs 6,720 crore for the said quarter. 

UBS report said that Airtel is market leader in six circles which include one metro and three among A category circles and VIL led in five circles including two metro circles and one A category circle. 

""Metros accounted for 11.6 per cent industry access revenue, while A circle share in the industry revenue was 40.7 per cent, circle B was 35 per cent and circle C was 12.6 per cent,"" the report said. 

UBS said that quarter-on-quarter recovery by Bharti and VIL in metros shows their 4G network expansion is gaining traction. 

""We expect the pricing environment to remain intense for the next 6-12 months with price increase likely in financial year 2020,"" UBS said.

IndiGo and Turkish Airlines announce code-share agreement - Times of India

","
MUMBAI: India's largest airline IndiGo, and Istanbul-based Turkish Airlines on Friday announced a codeshare and mutual cooperation agreement.



This is the first codeshare agreement for IndiGo as part of its international expansion strategy. Turkish, a Star Alliance airline is part of a global network of full-service carriers while IndiGo operates low-cost flights

``The signed codeshare and mutual cooperation agreement between the two carriers, the effectiveness of which is subject to receipt by IndiGo and Turkish Airlines of all necessary Board and regulatory approvals, will enable both carriers to provide more flexibility of choice to their respective customers to fly on sectors between India, Istanbul and beyond,’’ said IndiGo in a press release.

ABB to sell majority in Power Grids unit to Hitachi - Times of India

","
TOKYO/ZURICH: ABB will sell a majority stake in its Power Grids division to Japan's Hitachi and return the proceeds to shareholders, bowing to pressure from an activist investor to sell the business that makes transformers and converters. 

The acquisition, which values the unit at $11 billion, will see Hitachi become one of the largest players in the power grid industry. For ABB, which also makes industrial robots, the deal offloads its least profitable division, allowing it to focus on automation. But the decision to sell the unit marks a U-turn for ABB chief executive Ulrich Spiesshofer, who two years ago insisted on keeping the business, despite calls to sell from shareholders, including Swedish activist investor Cevian, which owns 5.3% of ABB. 

""Our shareholders have been with us for many years, they have been patient and have also had perseverance with us to see through the transformation,"" Spiesshofer said on a call with reporters. ""Now, we let them participate in the results of their patience."" Cash proceeds of $7.6-7.8 billion from the deal will be returned to shareholders via buybacks or similar means, ABB said. Cevian cofounder Lars Forberg said he was convinced the sale was right way forward for ABB. ""Focusing ABB's portfolio on digital industries and further simplifying business creates a better company and a strong basis for long-term growth."" Investor AB, ABB's largest investor with 10.7% equity, said it ""fully supports"" the transaction. 

ABB will retain remainder of Power Grids business, with an option to sell to Hitachi after three years. ABB's Power Grids business employs 36,000 people and had sales of $10.4 billion last year. reuters

DTC to launch inter-state CNG bus service from Delhi in Feb - Times of India

","
New Delhi, Dec 21 () Delhi Transport Corporation is planning to start inter-state services, with buses using CNG as fuel from February on pilot basis to develop green corridor around the national capital. ""We have got (safety) approval for Type-IV cylinder which is based on polymer or fibre. It is light and we have tested it on bus trial. We have decided to run these buses on long routes from Delhi to Agra, Jaipur, Haridwar and Chandigarh. We will call these routes green corridors because it will use clean fuel,"" Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told reporter here. The minister was talking to media persons on the sideline of a function of Indraprastha Gas Limited (IGL) to launch various digital initiatives for its consumers. Giving more detail about the pilot project, Pradhan said,""This service is being launched on trail basis which would be proved commercially viable eventually. After that, more such buses would be run on various routes"". A senior official said the cylinders have been imported from Germany that are lighter, and enables the bus to run for up to 700 kilometer in one fuel top up. The existing ordinary CNG buses have five steel cylinders with a capacity of 100 kg fuel top up. The new buses will have seven fibre cylinders which can store up to 300 kg CNG. The existing ordinary bus cost is about Rs 32 lakh, while the one with fibre cylinder would cost Rs 39 lakh as each cylinder cost is Rs one lakh per unit. He also said that once the pilot is successful then the cylinders will be manufactured here as it would reduce the cost from existing Rs one lakh per imported unit. The official also said that the DTC can procure these buses from Ashok Leyland and the fibre cylinders would be installed over the bus instead beneath the vehicle. The IGL has planned to press 8 such buses on long routes eventually next year to set example for other state transport departments and private operators. The DTC had stopped inter-state bus service since 2010 when the entire fleet was switched to CNG due to no availability of this fuel in other states. This pilot project will also mark the DTC's entry into inter-state transport segment again after almost 8 years. The digital initiative of the IGL include CNG Queue Management System (QMS) and Social CRM. The CNG Queue Management System through ""OORJA"" mobile application would provide information regarding the average waiting time at the CNG station and also alternative nearby CNG Station to the customers. The customers will know the waiting time for three broad categories i.e. buses, cars and autos. They will also be able to see CNG Station nearby. This application will be available through invitation initially for ten days and would be available for download from January 1, 2019. The technology platform-Social CRM will address customer queries, complaints, service requests, grievances on various social media platforms, such as facebook, twitter and Instagram. This can be used to effectively view and monitor the grievance redressal process by using the sentiment analysis. Pradhan also said that Rs 70,000 crore is being invested in the CGD (city gas distribution) network in the country. On this occasion the IGL also marked the crossing of one million domestic PNG (piped natural gas) customers in its areas of operation i e Delhi, Noida, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad and Rewari. The company felicitated the one millionth customer and certain auto drivers selected through lucky draw process. KKS BAL"

Govt not seeking RBI surplus funds to meet fiscal deficit: Minister - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: The government has not sought funds from surplus reserves of the Reserve Bank to meet fiscal deficit, minister of state for finance Pon Radhakrishnan said on Tuesday.


The minister in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha said, ""No, sir. Government has not asked funds from its surplus reserves to meet fiscal deficit.""

He was replying to a query if the government approached the RBI for extra funds from surplus reserves to meet fiscal deficit target.

The RBI has massive Rs 9.59 lakh crore reserves, and the finance ministry and independent director S Gurumurthy want it to be lowered in line with global practices.

The RBI's central board on November 19 decided to constitute an expert committee to examine the Economic Capital Framework of the RBI.

The terms of reference and composition of the expert committee is to be jointly determined by the government and the central banker.

""Government has asked for a review of RBI's Economic Capital Framework,"" the minister said in the house.

The RBI transferred Rs 50,000 crore as surplus amount to government in 2017-18.

An amount of Rs 30,659 crore was transferred in 2016-17 (the year of implementation of demonetisation) while Rs 65,876 crore was transferred in 2015-16.

RBI follows July-June financial year.

Sebi imposes Rs 15 lakh fine on Amtek Auto for failing to meet bond redemption deadline - Times of India

","
New Delhi, Dec 21 () Markets regulator Sebi Friday slapped a fine of Rs 15 lakh on debt-ridden Amtek Auto for failing to make NCD redemptions on due date and not disclosing to the bourses about rating downgrade. It was alleged that the auto firm had not notified the exchanges about downgrade of the credit rating, the delay in redemption and payment of interest, and certain other violations of the listing agreement, including selective redemption. The regulator in 2016 appointed an adjudicating officer to inquire into and adjudge the alleged violations of the relevant provisions of the Sebi Act and equity listing as well as debt listing agreement, among others by the company. Amtek Auto, in September 2010, issued non-convertible debentures (NCDs) of Rs 800 crore by way of private placement memorandum which was due for redemption in September 2015. According to Sebi, the company failed to make the redemption on the due date of payment. Further, the regulator noted that 56 NCD holders were paid ahead of the total 212 NCD holders in the issue. ""Thus, there is a clear admission of the company on records that it had redeemed NCDs of select investors over others,"" it added.  Moreover, the company has not informed the exchange about the downgrade of its rating by CARE or any other credit rating agency. However, it had intimated the exchange in October 2015 about the reasons for the downgrade of its rating by Brickwork Ratings, Sebi noted.  These actions on part of the noticee were in violation of of the ILDS (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations and Equity Listing Agreement, it added. Accordingly, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has imposed a penalty of Rs 15 lakh on Amtek Auto. SP ANU"

EU leaders agree small steps to buttress euro - Times of India

","
FRANKFURT: European leaders agreed Friday to press ahead with a limited, common eurozone budget and other steps to strengthen the currency union's resistance to downturns and crises.


The budget proposal leaves its size undefined and it appeared to fall short of more sweeping ideas pushed by French president Emmanuel Macron.

The European Union leaders said that finance ministers would work out the precise features of the budget and agree on them by June.

Macron has pushed for a large eurozone budget that could support member states that run into economic trouble. That would help close a key vulnerability of euro monetary union, which has one currency but 19 different governments. The euro bloc's weaknesses in adjusting to trouble were exposed during a financial and economic crisis that threatened to break up the currency union in 2010-2012.

The leaders statement Friday after a summit in Brussels said that the eurozone fund would be part of the overall EU budget, suggesting it is likely to be smaller than Macron's proposal. He has called for several percentage points of gross domestic output but the entire EU budget is only about 1 percent of GDP. The leaders' statement also defines the budget's purpose as helping making economies more competitive and similar in the way they function and omits mention of stabilizing countries in recession a key lack for the euro.

Proposals for a central budget have been resisted by Germany, which has been running budget surpluses, and other northern European countries concerned that they will be put on the hook for the troubles of less fiscally disciplined countries.

At a post-summit briefing, German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the budget ""a good contribution'' and said that ""we have agreed on significant parts of what Emmanuel Macron proposed... And the French president was certainly very satisfied with that, and so am I.''

French officials said the fund was a starting point and the amount could grow gradually. ""If you start by saying I want a trillion-euro budget that does everything, when people are already against the whole idea, then you'll never get anywhere,'' said a French official on customary condition of anonymity.

The leaders also approved giving additional financial firepower to the EU's fund that would help wind up or restructure failed banks. That would depend, however, on shaky banks cleaning up their finances.

There was no mention in the statement of progress toward EU-wide deposit insurance, which aims to strengthen the banking system by reassuring depositors their money is safe even if national backstops fall short. The proposal has been resisted by Germany, which has pushed to first ensure that banks purge their finances of hidden losses from bad loans.

Indian carriers will need 2,300 planes worth $320 billion in 20 years: Boeing - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Indian airlines are projected to need 2,300 planes worth $320 billion in the next 20 years amid unprecedented domestic passenger growth, aircraft maker Boeing said Wednesday as it raised the forecast for the country. 


A senior Boeing official also flagged concerns about low fare yields of Indian carriers, saying it cannot be sustained. 

As much as 85 per cent of the 2,300 planes would be narrow-body and the rest would be wide-body. 

The forecast is for the 2018-2037 period. 

According to Boeing, India would need 1,940 single-aisle planes worth $220 billion and 350 wide-body aircraft valued at $100 billion. 

At current exchange rate, $320 billion is over Rs 22 lakh crore. 

Around 10 regional jets worth less than $1 billion would be needed during the 2018-2037 period. 

""India continues to grow at a faster pace,"" Dinesh Keskar, Senior Vice President (Asia Pacific & India Sales) at Boeing Commercial Airplanes said here. 

Keskar also noted that aviation market in India is ""quite challenging"" as most airlines are not making money even as there is strong passenger growth. 

He noted that exchange rate, fuel prices and fare yields are the challenges. 

Boeing has raised its long-term forecast for commercial airplanes in India citing unprecedented domestic passenger traffic and rapidly expanding Low Cost Carriers (LCCs). 

In August last year, Boeing projected that India would need 2,100 commercial planes worth $290 billion. 

Flagging concerns about low fare yields, Keskar said it cannot be sustained as airlines are losing money in India. 

Amid stiff competition, domestic airlines are offering low fares despite higher operational costs. 

""We feel that fares in India even though the fares have come down, even though the exchange rates have come down they are at least 10-15 per cent lower than where you can break even. 

""If operation-wise you are losing money, then you can do it a little bit, you can do it for opening some routes but you cannot do it on a sustained basis,"" he said. 

Boeing said that this year alone, more than 10 million passengers, on average, travelled within India each month. 

""To meet this increased domestic air traffic growth, we see the vast majority of available airplane seats coming from LCCs,"" Keskar said. 

The success of this market segment would mean more than 80 per cent of all new airplane deliveries in the country would be single-aisles, he added. 

According to him, the superior economics and fuel efficiency of the new 737 MAX airplane would be the perfect choice for Indian carriers. 

India is the fastest growing domestic aviation market in the world and registered 50th straight month of double-digit growth in October. 

""Boeing continues to develop new fuel efficient airplanes and market leading services to address the needs of our customers in India,"" Keskar said. 

About Boeing MAX planes, Keskar said, ""we are assuring everyone that is a safe aircraft to fly"". 

Aviation regulator DGCA is monitoring on a daily basis the performance of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft apart from putting in place various measures to ensure there are no safety issues with these planes being operated in India.

income tax: Government orders cadre review, restructuring of Income Tax department; committee formed - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: A fresh cadre review and restructuring of the Income Tax department has been ordered by the government with an aim to create a ""caring but strict"" direct taxes regime in the country.


The 

  Central Board of Direct Taxes
 + (CBDT), that frames policy for the I-T department, on Monday ordered creation of a 12-member committee of senior officials to accomplish the task within the next three months.

The development assumes significance as another committee or task force to draft a new direct tax law to replace the existing Income Tax Act is already a work in progress and it has been asked by the government to submit its report by February 28.

The new committee to undertake cadre review and restructuring of the department has been given a specific four-point charter to follow.

A copy of the terms of reference of the committee has been accessed by PTI and it said the panel will suggest ways to ""organise the I-T department in a manner which will further promote compliance with direct tax laws through caring tax payer service and strict enforcement.""

It will also ""accordingly make advance projections of man power requirement and propose appropriate modifications in the extant organisational structure within the frame work of the government guidelines so as to facilitate filling up all the posts in the department in a time bound manner.""

The committee, chaired by Delhi-based Principal Director General of Income Tax, S K Dash, will also suggest ways to ""bring about rationalisation of the organisational structure for enhancing the effectiveness of the department through improved efficiency and morale of its workforce.""

The CBDT said the motive of the entire cadre review and restructuring exercise is to ""enable and equip the department to meet challenges of today and tomorrow.""

The last cadre restructuring of the department was carried out by the government in 2013 that led to the creation of 20,751 posts in various ranks. The exercise also gave the taxman the apex administrative pay scales of the central government for its top brass.

Officials said the latest exercise was finalised by the government after a lot of deliberations and keeping in mind two main ideas-- vacancies in the post of asistant commissioners and deputy commissioners that are to be filed by cadre officers of the department and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's idea of creating a regime where tax officials are friendly to honest taxpayers, end the fear of the taxman and make India a more tax compliant society.

""It is expected that the new direct tax law and cadre restructuring can be ushered in together so that the new system takes over with uniformity and in one go. However, the committee on cadre review and restructuring will only recommend its proposals and the government and the finance ministry will take the final call on what to pick and what to leave,"" a senior official said.

The CBDT has directed that the committee shall submit its report to it ""within a period of three months from the date of issuance of the order (December 17, 2018).""

The committee will also have members from the three employee associations in the department-- Indian Revenue Service (IRS), I-T Gazetted Officers Association and I-T Employees Federation.

Phone tapping: Is your phone being tapped? Now, you can ask Trai for info - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Citizens who want to find out if their phones are under surveillance can seek such information from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) under the RTI Act.


In a transparency-friendly ruling, the Delhi high court has held that Trai will have to furnish information on surveillance or tracking of an applicant’s phone by any agency since it has the legal power to obtain such info from a telecom service provider.

“If a public authority has a right and is entitled to access information from a private body, under any other law, it is ‘information’ as defined in Section 2 (f) of the RTI Act. Thus, it is an obligation on the public authority to get the information from the private body and furnish the same to the applicant,” Justice Suresh Kait noted in a recent order.

The ruling came on a plea filed by lawyer Kabir Shankar Bose. Justice Kait rejected the claim of Trai that it had no power to call information from the private body, i.e. Vodafone India in this case, pointing out that the regulator was regulating telecom services in India.

In September, the Central Information Commission (CIC) had asked Trai to provide Bose with the information after taking it from Vodafone. Vodafone, on the other hand, sought exemption from disclosure on the lawyer’s RTI plea, claiming itself to be a private organisation and not a ‘public authority’ as defined under the RTI Act.

Trai maintained that the information sought by Bose was not a part of record with it and on that ground alone it was not required to furnish the information under any law or rules. The RTI Act did not cast an obligation upon Trai to collect such non-available information and then furnish it to an applicant. The HC countered that ‘information includes in its ambit the information relating to any private body, which can be assessed by public authority under any law for the time being in force’.

SFIO probing Sahara Q Shop after govt received 744 complaints: Minister - Times of India

New Delhi, Dec 21 () The government Friday said the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) is probing Sahara group firm Sahara Q Shop Unique Products Range Ltd after receiving 744 complaints against the company. The embattled Sahara group is already facing action from markets regulator Sebi with respect to money raised by two entities -- Sahara India Real Estate Corporation Ltd (SIRECL) and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation Ltd (SHICL). To a query on whether the government has received several complaints against Sahara Q, Minister of State for Finance Pon Radhakrishnan replied in the affirmative. ""As per MCA21 data, Registrar of Companies (RoCs), Mumbai, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, has received 744 complaints against the company Sahara Q Shop Unique Products Range Ltd,"" he said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha. After examining the complaints and the documents filed by the company, the RoC submitted a report recommending an investigation, he added. The minister said the corporate affairs ministry has ordered investigation into the affairs of the company to be conducted by the SFIO. The order was issued on October 31, 2018. MCA21, under the corporate affairs ministry, is the portal for submitting filings under the Companies Act. On whether Sebi has been directed to accommodate investors of other schemes of Sahara India Group namely Sahara India Q Shop as investors were forced to convert their investments into Sahara Q Shop from SIRECL and SHICL, Radhakrishan replied in the negative. According to him, the Supreme Court, in its order on August 31, 2012, directed Sebi to make refunds to only those investors, who invested in Optionally Fully Convertible Debentures (OFCDs) of SIRECL and/ or SHICL. ""Accordingly, the investments in other schemes/ group companies of Sahara, including the Sahara Q Shop are prima-facie not covered in the said order of the Supreme Court,"" he added. RAM     ANU"

Arun Jaitley: PSBs to get fresh equity of Rs 83,000cr 

","
NEW DELHI: The government on Thursday announced a significant rampup in its capital infusion plan for public sector banks (PSBs), with Rs 83,000 crore to be provided over the next few months, taking the recapitalisation amount during the current financial year to Rs 1.06 lakh crore.


The statement from finance minister Arun Jaitley came hours after he sought Parliamentary nod for a fresh capital infusion of Rs 41,000 crore, over and above the Rs 65,000 crore he had budgeted for. So far, Rs 23,000 crore has already been released by the ministry.



The demand for fresh funds for PSBs was part of the supplementary demand for grants moved in Parliament, which entails an additional spending of around Rs 86,000 crore although the cash outgo would be limited to Rs 15,000 crore. It also includes fresh equity of Rs 2,300 crore for cash-guzzler Air India, which had received Rs 1,630 crore earlier in the fiscal year.

Financial services secretary Rajiv Kumar told reporters that priority will be to provide funds to three-to-four banks that are not fully compliant with RBI norms related to NPAs and capital but have not slipped into the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework (for weak banks that would inhibit their ability to expand). The other focus segment is banks that have shown improvement on some of the PCA parameters and are now profitable such as Corporation Bank and Bank of Maharashtra.

The fund allocation would also be linked to the ability of these banks to raise equity from the market and also get rid of noncore assets. “This (fund infusion) will increase the lending capacity of public sector banks as well as help some of them come out of RBI’s watch list,” Jaitley said.

India to retain top aviation safety category, US FAA tells government - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: India’s aviation safety oversight will not be downgraded and continue to retain its top billing. The American Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which recently conducted an audit of Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), on Tuesday said that India will remain in Category 1-status of safety.


The thumbs up from the FAA means that Indian carriers will not face hurdles while expanding flights to the US. 

Air India, the only Indian carrier that flies to America, will not face stringent checks on its aircraft when they land there and the Maharaja will be able to add frequencies on existing routes as well as have new destinations there on its network.

A senior DGCA official said, “FAA conducted an audit of DGGA in July 2018 to confirm India’s adherence to the standards laid down by ICAO (UN’s aviation arm International Civil Aviation Organization) and oversight of Indian airlines. During consultations held with FAA in early November, DGCA presented the actions taken to address the findings of the July 2018 audit. On Tuesday, FAA has formally communicated that India is adhering to the safety standards of ICAO and have confirmed that India’s International Aviation Safety Assessment (IASA) rating remains Category 1.”

The FAA had made about 30 observations earlier this July, all of which were satisfactorily addressed by the DGCA. “Their biggest finding in July was that some charter/private plane operators from India fly to US using aircraft for which DGCA does not have flight operations inspectors type-rated on those planes. That issue has been resolved,” said sources.

India, meanwhile, expects its overall aviation safety score given to different countries by ICAO to also improve significantly. 

Following an audit last year, the United Nation’s aviation arm had lowered India’s “effective implementation” (EI) from 65.82% to 57.44% against world average of 62% mainly due to the issue of air traffic controllers’ (ATCO) licensing. 

An ICAO team again audited the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) from November 12-21 to see if the shortcomings had been addressed to make flying safer here and told the Indian authorities that the country’s EI score could rise to 74%.

The overall EI figure is calculated after taking an aggregate of individual scores in eight fields like legislation, organisation, personnel licensing and airworthiness of aircraft. This score gives an overall picture of how a country is complying with global aviation safety practices under different heads.

TOKYO: SoftBank shares sank 15% on debut, wiping $9 billion off their value, as investors sold off the telecom operator after its record IPO on worries about a recent service outage and its exposure to Chinese telecoms gear maker Huawei.


The poor start for unit of tech investment giant Soft-Bank Group meant that for Japan’s mom-and-pop investors concerns about company and the nation’s telecoms market trumped the appeal of the group’s charismatic founder Masayoshi Son.

Such a debut is uncommon in the Japanese IPO market. Of 82 IPOs so far this year, SoftBank’s $23.5-billion float was only the seventh to open below the offering price. Among recent major IPOs, Japan Display was the only one to flop, suffering a fall in its 2014 debut.

“There was a disruption in its network early this month as well as Huawei’s issues. There hasn’t been good news involving Soft-Bank recently,” said Tetsuro Ii, CEO at Commons Asset Management.

Shares of SoftBank closed at 1,282 yen, 14.5% lower than its IPO price of 1,500 yen and giving the telco a market cap of about 6.1 trillion yen — about 1.1 trillion yen below its value at the time of the IPO. Shares opened trading at 1,463 yen.

“It was beyond our expectations that the shares would fall that much,” said a senior executive at one of SoftBank’s domestic lead underwriters, declining to be named since he was not authorised to discuss the matter with the media. Soft-Bank shares were the most heavily traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s first section, as amid heightened risk aversion the benchmark Nikkei 225 index fell to a nine-month low, closing down 0.6%. SoftBank Group lost 1%%.

In a first, government wants to re-open IL&FS group balance sheets - Times of India

","
MUMBAI: The corporate affairs ministry on Thursday moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking to reopen the books of IL&FS Group and its subsidiaries for the past five years under Section 130 of the Companies Act, to ascertain financial mismanagement.


This is the first time that government has invoked the powers under Section 130 0f the new Companies Act of 2013 to reopen ledgers of a company.

The government wants to check the balance-sheets of crippled group and the two listed subsidiaries--ITNL and IL&FS Financial Services for the past years and the move comes after the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) has found shocking details of corruption, personal enrichment and other non-transparent deals.

The court, however, refused to pass an immediate order saying it has to seek the views of the relevant statutory bodies and regulators such as the Reserve Bank, the markets watchdog Sebi and the Income Tax Department, before taking a call on the petition.

The two-member bench of judges VP Singh and Ravikumar Duraisamy said they will issue the notices today and will hear the matter when the court reopens on January 1, 2019.

The ministry also submitted a report on the views of the Institute of Chartered Accountants on the IL&FS Group's accounts, which were audited by Deloitte, EY affiliate SRBC and KPMG affiliate BSR.

The move comes after an SFIO probe has found serious mismanagement of accounts and fraudulent transactions across the group by the past management.

The SFIO probe has uncovered serious wrongdoing by the past management of the embattled group, with instances of income misreporting, dubious transactions, conflicts of interest deals, ever-greening of loans and personal enrichment by some key employees.

The ministry had submitted the SFIO interim report to the NCLT on December 3.

The government plea also wants NCLT to appoint an independent chartered accountant to take restate the accounts and revise the balance-sheets of IL&FS, IL&FS Financial Services and IL&FS Transportation Network and wants three months to do the job. The group owes over Rs 94,000 crore to lenders, mostly banks.

It can be noted that this is the first instance of government invoking Section 130 of the Companies Act, which empowers it reopen accounts only on a court/tribunal' order.

The law states that ""a company shall not re-open its books of account and not recast its financial statements, unless an application is made by the Central government, income-tax authorities, Sebi, any other statutory regulatory body or authority or any person concerned and an order is made by a court of competent jurisdiction or the tribunal to the effect that i) the relevant earlier accounts were prepared in a fraudulent manner; or (ii) the affairs of the company were mismanaged during the relevant period, casting a doubt on the reliability of financial statements.""

Meanwhile, the bench approved the appointment of two new directors to the board of IL&FS Financial Services.

Former bureaucrat Vijay Kumar and senior chartered accountant N Srinivasan have been appointed as non-executive directors after GN Bajpai resigned from the board within a month of government appointing him in October.

With this, there are eight non-executive directors on the IL&FS board, including chairman Uday Kotak, vice-chairman and managing director Vineet Nayyar, GC Chaturvedi, Nand Kishore, Malini Shankar and CS Rajan.

Google new campus: Google to spend $1 billion to establish new campus in New York - Times of India

","
NEW YORK: Alphabet Inc's Google is investing over $1 billion to establish a new campus in New York, becoming the second major technology company after Amazon to pick America's financial capital to expand and create thousands of jobs.


The 1.7 million square-foot campus, called Google Hudson Square, will include leased properties at Hudson Street and Washington Street, the company said in a blog post on Monday. Google hopes to start moving into the building by 2022.

Google's plans to invest outside its home base mirror those of other US tech bigwigs such as Apple Inc, which recently said it would spend $1 billion to build a new campus in Austin, Texas.

The move to invest in prime real estate in the westside of Manhattan also underscores the growing importance of New York as a hub for innovation and an incubator for technology companies.

""Our investment in New York is a huge part of our commitment to grow and invest in US facilities, offices and jobs. In fact, we're growing faster outside the Bay Area than within it,"" said Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Alphabet and Google.

Amazon.com Inc said in November it would create more than 25,000 jobs in both New York and the Washington, DC area by opening massive new offices.

Google's first New York office at 111 Eighth Avenue is one of the city's largest buildings that it bought in 2010 for $1.77 billion.

Earlier this year, the company announced a $2.4 billion purchase of the Manhattan Chelsea Market. It also has leased space on Pier 57 jutting into the Hudson, which will create a four-block campus.

With investments in Google Chelsea and Google Hudson Square, the company said it would more than double the number of employees in New York over the next 10 years. The company has more than 7,000 employees in New York.

PAC asks Centre, states to ensure 100% coverage under food law - Times of India

","
New Delhi, Dec 21 () The Public Accounts Committee has asked the central and state governments to achieve 100 per cent coverage of beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act and set up independent food commissions in all states in the next three months. The law, which was passed in 2013, is now being implemented in all 36 states/UTs covering 80.57 crore beneficiaries out of the total estimate of 81.34 crore, thus bringing the coverage to 99.05 per cent, the committee said in a report presented in Parliament Friday on preparedness for implementation of the Act by Union Food Ministry. ""In a populous country like India, even 1 per cent of the poor and weaker sections translate into a big number. In the opinion of the committee, the states cannot keep such a section deprived of food security which is the very basis of the Act,"" the panel observed. The committee ""in unequivocal terms"" recommend that all-out efforts should be made under strict monitoring of the ministry so as to achieve 100 per cent coverage of the beneficiaries, it added. Under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), the government provides 5 kg of wheat and rice per month at Rs 2-3 per kg.The beneficiaries under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) will get 35 kg per households per month. Stating that 99.22 crore beneficiaries were covered under the earlier public distribution system (PDS), the panel said the ministry should make all efforts to ensure rightful targeting of beneficiaries and recommended necessary steps to bring all eligible beneficiaries of the NFSA under PDS immediately. That apart, the PAC pointed out that maternity benefits under the Act have not been implemented in all States/UTs and asked the ministry to take all tenable measures in consultation with the Union Ministry of Women and Child Development and States/UTs concerned. The committee also emphasised on the need to have adequate transportation and storage capacity for foodgrains. It suggested a national contingency plan for procurement, movement and storage of foodgrains for unforseen events like natural calamities. The PAC asked the ministry to initiate a pilot project to minimise the cost of procurement, transportation and distribution cost of foodgrains. Private parties should also be invited to take part in this pilot. The committee asked the food ministry to complete end-to-end the computerisation of PDS operations. On food commissions, the PAC said that only 16 states have constituted independent state food commissions while six are in the process of setting up. It asked the ministry to issue necessary directions to the States/UTs concerned and ensure establishment of fully functional independent food commissions within 3 months of presentation of report in Parliament.

IL&FS news: IL&FS to auction road assets worth Rs 25,000-30,000 crore - Times of India

","
MUMBAI: The break-up and sale of the IL&FS group has gathered pace with the new government-appointed board putting on the block road assets worth Rs 25,000-30,000 crore, which account for almost a third of the group’s liabilities. Expressions of interest have been invited for seven operating annuity projects, eight toll projects and four projects that are under construction and held by IL&FS Transportation Network — a listed subsidiary. In addition to these road projects adding up to over 10,000km, there are three other businesses in the transportation sector.


The seven operating annuity projects include the 9.28km Chenani-Nashri Tunnelway (CNTL), also known as the Patni Top Tunnel, which was inaugurated by the Prime Minister last year and is India’s longest road tunnel. The CNTL project, which has Rs 4,200 crore of term loans and external commercial borrowing, is contractually entitled to receive semi-annuities of Rs 318 crore in September and March every year till the end of the concession period. 

The second-largest project is the Jharkhand Road Project Implementation Company, which is 6.57%-owned by IL&FS and 93.43%-owned by its subsidiary ITNL. It has undertaken and implemented five projects totalling 627-lane km. The other annuity projects include the Maharashtra border to Belgaum, Thiruvananthapuram City Roads, East Hyderabad Expressway, Hazaribaugh Ranchi Expressway, and Jorhat-Shillong Expressway.




The non-road assets and businesses are the EPC (engineering, procurement & construction) and O&M (operation & maintenance) businesses of IL&FS Transportation Networks and a sports complex in Thiruvananthapuram.

This is the third lot of assets put on sale since the new board took charge. Earlier, the board had decided to sell the securities and the renewable energy businesses, which are together estimated to fetch Rs 10,000 crore. The total debt of the IL&FS group is estimated at over Rs 90,000 crore.

Incidentally, private equity investor Lonestar had earlier signed term sheets with IL&FS to pick up select road projects. Lonestar had been planning to pick up a stake in the IL&FS Transport Network but subsequently decided to buy the assets. Later, Cube Highways, backed by global private equity fund I Squared Capital and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), entered the fray. While negotiations with Cube had progressed, the new board decided to start afresh and invite expressions of interest for a more transparent price discovery process.

“Any binding transaction for the sale of assets, as well as the resulting resolution plan(s), will be subject to receipt of all requisite approvals (including the NCLT or where necessary, the high courts) before the transactions are implemented”, the company said in a statement. The IL&FS board, on behalf of the entire IL&FS group, including ITNL, has appointed Arpwood Capital and JM Financial as financial & transaction advisers, along with Alvarez & Marsal as resolution consultants.

TOI impact: DGCA inspector, who turned test flight into 'spirited' joyride for relatives, resigns - Times of India

","
MUMBAI: Capt Pankaj Anand, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) inspector whose wife and sister-in-law took a joyride on board a charter flight where he flew as an examiner, has resigned. 


Capt Anand, a deputy chief flight operations inspector (DyCFOI) with the 

  DGCA had carried out an ""examiner release check""
 + on two pilots of a Delhi-based charter company, even as in the passenger cabin his family members partied with the director of the said charter company and his wife. The DGCA initiated an investigation into the incident after the Times of India carried a report on December 11, exposing the happenings on board the Delhi-Amritsar-Delhi flight, along with a photograph that showed the women in aircraft passenger cabin holding bottles of wine. Alcohol consumption is banned by the DGCA on domestic flights.




DGCA inspector turns test flight into ‘spirited’ joyride for relativesThe blatant nexus between DGCA officials and aircraft operators was on show as the wife of the charter company’s director subsequently posted photographs of the joyride on her private Instagram account.


""Capt Anand was forced to resign. He was reluctant to put in his papers, he argued that other DGCA officials too have taken favours from charter aircraft operators in the past. But the director-general of civil aviation stood his ground,"" said the DGCA source. Capt Anand was on leave when he received a call from the director general on Monday demanding that he resign, the source said. ""He vacated his DGCA office today afternoon,"" the source added. A DyCFOI is second only to the chief flight operations inspector in the flight standard directorate of the DGCA.

The said ""irregular check"" took place on December 4, on board a Pilatus aircraft operated by Delhi-based aircraft charter company Air Charter Services Ltd. The flight was operated to allow the two pilots employed with this charter company to clear their ""examiner release check"" which was carried out by the DGCA DyCFOI, Capt Anand.

A copy of the passenger manifest for the Delhi-Amritsar and Amritsar-Delhi flight showed that on board along with Capt Anand was his wife Priti Anand, his sister-in-law, Sharika Anand. They were hosted by the Semoun Jolly, director of the said charter company and Dipti Jolly, his wife. Photographs showing the passengers posing with wine bottles during the return leg was posted on a restricted social media account by Dipti Jolly. Following the flight, Capt Anand had cleared the two pilots to be designated as examiners. 

In their new role as examiners, these two pilots of ACS can now carry out skill tests on commanders, co-pilots certified on Pilatus, impart training, carry out final simulator check etc. ACS, the said charter company doesn’t have an accident-free record. In May 2011, ten people were killed after a Pilatus PC12 belonging to ACS met with an accident in Faridabad, Haryana while operating a Patna to Delhi flight. In March 2017, another Pilatus PC 12 belonging to the same company crashed during a Delhi-Bangkok flight, killing the pilot and leaving several others injured. 

Sources from the DGCA said that in course of the investigation, Capt Anand's defense was that his wife paid for the seat on board the said check flight. ""The issue is whether the payment was credited into the charter company's account before the December 4 flight or was it manipulated later. Will Capt Anand claim that he paid it all in cash? Or issued the company a cheque? Can he prove it isn't a back dated cheque?,"" the source said.

Swiggy Funding: Swiggy gets $1bn funding, valuation zooms to $3.3bn - Times of India

","
BENGALURU: India's consumer internet companies continue to attract blockbuster funding rounds. On Thursday, online food-delivery platform Swiggy announced it has received $1 billion in a new round led by existing investor Naspers, the South African media giant. 


New investors include China's Tencent, owner of WeChat, and hedge funds Hillhouse Capital and Wellington Management. Existing investors DST Global, Meituan Dianping and Coatue Management also participated in this round, which saw some existing investors sell part of their stake.

The funding is said to have valued Swiggy at $3.3 billion - a sharp jump from the $1.3-billion valuation in June when it raised $210 million, and the $700-million valuation in February when it raised $100 million.




The new capital gives Swiggy more ammunition to take on Zomato, which is backed by Ant Financial, which is affiliated to China's Alibaba. According to industry estimates, Swiggy does about 25 million orders a month, compared to 16-17 million by Zomato. In October, Zomato raised $210 million from Ant Financial at an estimated valuation of $2 billion. Swiggy plans to use the fresh funds to enter new categories, including medicine and grocery delivery. The company said it will also bring more quality food brands closer to consumers and address gaps in supply through delivery-only kitchens for restaurant partners. The company plans to hire top-notch talent, especially for machine learning and engineering roles across mid and senior levels as it looks to focus on building a next-generation, AI-driven platform for hyper-local discovery and on-demand delivery. 

""As we add more firepower to our vision of elevating quality of life for urban consumers by offering unparalleled convenience, we're pleased that visionary global investors share our purpose and have made such a significant investment in our future,"" Swiggy CEO Sriharsha Majety said in a statement. Majety founded the company in 2014 together with his BITS-Pilani colleague Nandan Reddy. The two later got in touch with IIT-Kharagpur alumnus Rahul Jaimini who joined them as co-founder and CTO. 

Leading Indian consumer internet companies - including Paytm, Ola, Oyo, Byju's and PolicyBazaar - have received large funding amounts over the past year or so. Flipkart was bought out by Walmart in a deal that valued the former at $21 billion. Investors clearly believe these companies are fundamentally disrupting their respective markets, or creating large new ones. 

Larry Illg, CEO of food and ventures at Naspers, said Swiggy has grown its monthly orders by 10 times since Naspers first put money in the firm in April 2017. ""Now, nearly two years later, we have even more confidence Swiggy has the winning formula and will continue to build a leading business in the country. Swiggy has expanded throughout India to tier-1, -2 and -3 cities, and most importantly, is the most loved food delivery brand in India, providing the best service to consumers nationwide,"" he added.

Swiggy says it has over 50,000 restaurant partners spread across more than 50 cities with about 120,000 delivery partners. 

Naspers alone put in $660 million in the latest round. The South African company recently led another funding round of $540 million in education technology firm Byju's.

SoftBank IPO: SoftBank mobile unit in record IPO but flops on market debut - Times of India

","
TOKYO: Japanese technology giant SoftBank raised a record amount for its mobile unit in the world's second-biggest ever IPO but the shares plunged in a disappointing debut trading session on Wednesday.


A spokesperson for the firm confirmed it had raised around 2.65 trillion yen ($23.5 billion) via the unit's IPO, making it Japan's largest and the second-biggest globally after Alibaba went public in 2014.

But the stock opened at 1,463 yen, significantly lower than the initial offer price of 1,500 yen per share, and headed lower from there.

The shares finished the session at 1,282 yen, down 14.5 per cent from the IPO price with heavy selling into the close.

Analysts said the IPO had not come at a particularly good time for the new company, named SoftBank Corp, as global markets have been suffering in recent months and Japan is taking aim at what they see as mobile operators' overly high prices.

The benchmark Nikkei 225 index slipped 0.6 per cent while the broader Topix index was down 0.4 percent.

Other market players said tepid demand was not helped by an embarrassing episode earlier this month when a technical glitch left tens of millions of SoftBank and UK mobile phone operator O2 customers unable to access data.

Add to that global security concerns over China's Huawei and ""the number of those who wanted to buy the shares was rather small"", said Masayuki Toshida, senior market analyst at Rakuten Securities.

""Concerns that SoftBank's investment costs could rise because it would not be able to use Huawei parts is a reason not to buy the shares,"" said one analyst in Tokyo, who declined to be identified.

SoftBank took more than one-third of its mobile unit public and was able to sell the full offering of 1.76 billion shares at the IPO price of 1,500 yen, beating the previous national records set by NTT in 1987 and its subsidiary NTT Docomo in 1998.

The blockbuster IPO is seen as part of boss Masayoshi Son's strategy of transforming SoftBank from a Japan-based telecom company to a global hi-tech investment firm.

Son has already said the IPO would go towards swelling the coffers of his SoftBank Vision Fund, which is worth an estimated $100 billion and has taken stakes in some of the hottest tech firms, including Uber, Slack, WeWork and Nvidia.

SoftBank and Son have come under the spotlight recently as nearly half the money in the fund comes from Saudi Arabia and the firm maintains close ties with the kingdom.

Those links were highlighted after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, which sent shares in SoftBank spiralling.

Last month, in eagerly awaited comments on the scandal, Son condemned the killing but said he would continue to do business with Saudi Arabia.

Analysts at S&P Ratings have said the IPO ""would further underline SoftBank's transition to an investment holding company"".

Another ratings agency, Moody's, said the IPO would ""enhance transparency"" in the parent company's investment portfolio because the mobile unit's ""share price and daily market value will be available to the public"".

The SoftBank parent company itself has said the listing would give the mobile unit ""greater managerial autonomy to develop its own growth strategy"".

It has also said the listing would help clarify the roles of the parent company and its mobile unit.

The mobile unit said in a statement alongside the market debut that it expects net profit of 420 billion yen on sales of 3.7 trillion yen for the full year to March 2019.

vine cofounder: Vine, HQ Trivia co-founder Colin Kroll found dead - Times of India

","
NEW YORK: US tech star Colin Kroll, who co-founded Vine and popular gaming app HQ Trivia, was found dead Sunday in New York of an apparent drug overdose. Police found Kroll, 34, unconscious and unresponsive in a bedroom of his Manhattan apartment, a New York police spokesman told a television channel.


A drug overdose is the suspected cause of death, police said, and an investigation is underway.

Kroll co-founded Vine, the popular short-form video service acquired in 2012 by Twitter that is now defunct.

In September, he was named the chief executive of HQ Trivia, a smartphone-based trivia platform.

HQ Trivia confirmed his death in a statement.

""We learned today of the passing of our friend and founder, Colin Kroll, and it's with deep sadness that we say goodbye,"" it said. ""Our thoughts go out to his family, friends and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time.""

HQ Trivia, launched in August 2017, was a blockbuster, hitting a March milestone of two million concurrent players.

But by November, the number of users plunged from millions to hundreds of thousands, according to tech news site Recode.

Time magazine said Kroll, who was reportedly fired from Twitter over poor management behavior, was facing allegations he had acted inappropriately at HQ Trivia.

Malaysia files criminal charges against Goldman Sachs - Times of India

","
KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia filed criminal charges against Goldman Sachs and two former executives on Monday for their role in the alleged multibillion-dollar ransacking of state investment fund 1MDB.


 Attorney General Tommy Thomas said the government is seeking several billion dollars in fines from Goldman Sachs for breaches of securities laws that involved it making false and misleading statements to investors.

 He said his office will seek prison sentences of up to 10 years for the former Goldman executives, Roger Ng Chong Hwa and Tim Leissner, who is married to model Kimora Lee Simmons.

 Malaysian and U.S. prosecutors allege that bond sales organized by Goldman Sachs for 1MDB provided one of the means for associates of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak to steal billions over several years from a fund that was ostensibly set up to accelerate Malaysia's economic development.

 The scandal, first reported by Sarawak Report and the Wall Street Journal, resulted in Najib and his ruling coalition losing power in a historic election defeat earlier this year.

 Najib himself is facing corruption charges. He has said that more than $700 million that moved through his bank account was a political donation from the Saudi royal family, but U.S. prosecutors say it came from 1MDB, of which Najib was the top official.

 U.S. legal filings that are part of a Justice Department civil case to recover assets bought with 1MDB funds allege the money was used to finance Hollywood films and spent on luxuries such as diamond jewelry for Najib's wife, a yacht, artworks and high-end properties.

 Goldman Sachs denied any wrongdoing in response to Malaysia's criminal charges.

 ""We believe these charges are misdirected and we will vigorously defend them and look forward to the opportunity to present our case,"" bank spokesman Edward Naylor said in a statement. ""The firm continues to cooperate with all authorities investigating these matters.""

 Thomas said $2.7 billion was stolen from three bond sales organized by subsidiaries of Goldman Sachs. The investment bank, he said, received $600 million in fees for organizing the bond deals, which was several times higher than industry norms.

 Leissner and Ng conspired with Najib associate Low Taek Jho, a key architect of the entire 1MDB fraud, to bribe Malaysian government officials to use Goldman Sachs as the arranger of the bond deals, according to Thomas. They and Goldman Sachs knew that the money would be stolen, he said.

 ""Having held themselves out as the pre-eminent global adviser/arranger for bonds, the highest standards are expected of Goldman Sachs,"" the attorney general's statement said. ""They have fallen far short of any standard. In consequence, they have to be held accountable.""

 Prosecutors plan to seek fines ""well in excess"" of the amount allegedly stolen because of the severity of the violations of Malaysia's laws, Thomas said.

 Leissner, who headed Goldman's operations in Southeast Asia, last month pleaded guilty in the U.S. to money laundering conspiracy and conspiring to violate foreign bribery laws after the Justice Department charged him, Ng and Low in relation to the 1MDB scandal.

 Ng was arrested in Malaysia in early November and Low, also known as Jho Low, remains at large. He has previously maintained his innocence in statements via a lawyer.

 Malaysian police said in July that Low had fled Macau to an unknown destination.

 Before facing criminal charges, Low became well known in the New York City and Los Angeles club scenes. In 2012, he threw a lavish 31st birthday bash attended by Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian and other celebrities.

Facebook scandal: Facebook reportedly gave tech giants access to users' private messages - Times of India

","
NEW YORK: Social media giant Facebook has been sharing its users' personal data, including private messages and contact information for users' friends, with some of the world's largest technology companies like Microsoft, Amazon, far beyond what it has publicly admitted, according to leaked internal documents.


Facebook gave Netflix and Spotify the ability to read users' private messages. They allowed Microsoft's search engine Bing to see the names of Facebook users' friends without permission, and they let Amazon find users' names and contact information through their friends on the platform, The New York Times reported on Tuesday.

Embroiled in a massive data breach following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook has been reeling from a series of privacy scandals. In March, it was revealed that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, improperly used personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users.

Facebook gave access to user data to more than 150 companies - most of them tech businesses, including online retailers and entertainment sites, but also automakers and media organisations.

In 2011 in an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Facebook stated that the company cannot share user data ""without explicit permission.""

""This is just giving third parties permission to harvest data without you being informed of it or giving consent to it,"" David Vladeck, who ran the FTC's consumer protection bureau, was quoted as saying by the report.

The 270-pages internal documents, as well as interviews with about 50 former employees of Facebook and its corporate partners, reveal that Facebook allowed certain companies access to data despite the protections, the report said.

Their applications sought the data of hundreds of millions of people a month, the records show. The deals, the oldest of which date to 2010, were all active in 2017. Some were still in effect this year, the report said.

The documents showed that ""while Facebook users can control what data they share with most of the thousands of apps on Facebook's platform, some companies had access to users' data even if they had disabled all sharing.""

Mark Zuckerberg, who co-founded Facebook in 2004, assured US lawmakers in April that people ""have complete control"" over everything they share on Facebook. He acknowledged that it had breached users' trust and insisted that it had instituted stricter privacy protections long ago.

income tax: How to avoid tax saving traps: Things to know - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Looking for a tax-saving option? How about a plan that gives you tax savings, provides tax-free income at regular intervals and gives a big lump sum on maturity? Plus, you also get life cover.



Sounds good? At first glance, a plan from a large life insurance company certainly appears lucrative. But the reality dawns once you analyse the numbers in detail. However, despite poor returns, lakhs of money-back policies and endowment plans get sold during the tax planning season every year. This is because the average investor neither has the time or the inclination to go into the finer details of the policy. Prodded by his employer to show investment proof by the deadline and impressed by the rosy picture drawn by the insurance salesperson, he just wants to get it over with.



Why you may need an adviserSome of us are very enamored by the markets, and find the process of investing very stimulating. Some have a great skill in execution, and find it easy to follow through and complete planned investment decisions. Some are in charge of money and find the costs of outsourcing painful. DIY is suitable in such cases. 



The result? A lot of heartburn and complaints. It is also not surprising that most complaints received by the insurance ombudsman relate to misselling.

This story looks at some of the traps laid out by wealth managers and bank executives to trick taxpayers into unsuitable investments. Read on to know how you can avoid getting trapped.


What they say

“This plan is just like an ELSS fund, but also provides life insurance cover.”


What they hide

“It is a Ulip and the life cover is not free. You will be charged for it.”

This is the favourite line of bank executives when asked for a tax-saving option. Investors have now woken up to the benefits of equity investing. But if you buy an ELSS fund, the bank gets a very small commission. So they lure you with talk of free insurance cover with mutual fund. This insurance is not free though, and comes with mortality charges. A Ulip plan requires a multi-year commitment and exiting in a few years will also mean surrender charges. Unlike a Ulip plan, investors in ELSS funds are also not compelled to remain invested for the long term.


What they say

“This scheme is launched by the bank and therefore, is very safe and reliable.”


What they hide

“It is a life insurance policy from a company promoted by the bank.”

Banks, especially PSU entities, enjoy a lot of trust among their customers. They play on this trust by bombarding customers with SMSs about lucrative savings plans that can cut tax, which are in fact insurance policies from a company in which the bank is just a promoter. In most cases, the buyer realises that he has been trapped much later when the policy is already in operation and cannot be terminated without suffering a heavy loss.


What they say
“Investing in NPS is complicated. This pension plan is much better.”


What they hide

“Pension plans from insurers have much higher charges than the low-cost NPS.”

If you ask any bank executive about the NPS, be prepared to get a blank look. It’s been almost 10 years since the pension scheme was thrown open to the general public, but wealth managers and relationship managers in banks have little knowledge how it works and how one can start investing in it. Even if they know the process, nobody wants to promote the low-cost NPS. The pension scheme offers an ultra-thin commission to the intermediary. Instead, most bank executives will push pension plans from insurance companies. And not without a reason. These regular pension plans have much higher costs than what you pay when you invest in the NPS. Even their online versions, which should not have a high cost structure, have significantly higher charges than the NPS funds. One plan, for instance, has an “investment guarantee fee” in addition to the fund management charge.


What they say

“This plan is just like a fixed deposit but gives taxfree returns and insurance cover.”


What they hide

“It is an endowment insurance policy and the returns will be very low.”

Many taxpayers, especially senior citizens, do not want to lock up their money for the long term. They prefer tax-saving fixed deposits because they are very safe and have a lock-in period of five years. But the interest is fully taxable at the marginal rate applicable to the investor. In the 30% tax bracket, this brings down the post-tax return close to 5%. Relationship managers exploit this poor tax efficiency of fixed deposits to offer taxpayers an investment option with “tax free returns”. This is actually an endowment insurance policy. The taxpayer is given the impression that he is investing in a fixed deposit whereas he gets trapped in a multi-year premium commitment. The worst hit are older taxpayers who don’t have enough liquidity to pay the premium every year. At one time this had become such a big problem for senior citizens that the insurance regulator changed the rules. Many endowment policies now have an upper age limit of 50 years.


What they say
“Invest in ELSS to save tax and gain from the rise in the stock market.”


What they hide

“ELSS funds are market linked. It is not advisable to put a large sum at one go.”

ELSS funds are undoubtedly one of the best ways to save tax. Apart from saving tax under Section 80C, the taxpayer is able to create wealth by investing in these equity funds. The ELSS category has delivered annualised returns of 16.5% in the past five years, making them the highest wealth creator among all tax-saving instruments. The 10-year annualised return is even higher at 17.5%. At the same time, it is not advisable to invest a large sum in equity funds at one go. The best way is to start an SIP of Rs 5,000-10,000 at the beginning of the financial year so that the ups and downs in the market get absorbed over time. But wealth managers will not tell you this when you ask them for a tax saving option. They want you to invest at one go so that there is no possibility of you stopping the investment or changing the fund after 3-4 SIPs.


How to avoid getting trapped

These simple measures can prevent mis-sellers from pushing investments you don’t need:


No verbal promises

Never believe a plan or offer till you see it in black and white. Make sure the brochure shown to you is authorised and is not some promotional material. Check credentials of the seller. All claims must be in writing and signed on the paper


Don’t buy in a hurry

Anybody who pushes you to invest within a deadline is probably misselling. Don’t close the deal in the first or second meeting, ask for at least 7-10 days to study the plan. Tell the distributor you will compare it with other investment options


Second opinion

Discuss the plan with a friend or relative who is an expert. The worst misselling happens at banks, where relationship managers push high commission products. Go to a financial planner, who charges a fee, but gives objective advice


Do your paperwork

Mis-sellers succeed when the investor are pressed for time. Most of the time the buyer just signs on the application form and leaves the paperwork to the agent. Let him fill the form for you but insist on seeing it before you put your signature on it


Use free look period

If the policy document does not mention the promised benefits, return the policy within the 15-day free look period. Agents try and buy time. The policy document should reach you within 2-3 days of issuance

","
NEW DELHI: Online education start-up Byju's on Monday said it has raised $540 million (Rs 3,865 crore) in funding, led by Naspers with a significant portion also being contributed by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB). The new round of funding will drive innovation for tech-enabled learning products and also fuel plans for international market expansion for Byju's, a statement said. 


 ""We are happy to have prominent and long-term partners like Naspers and CPPIB on board with us. This partnership will strengthen our ability to deliver on our vision to build the world's largest education company,"" Byju's founder and CEO Byju Raveendran said. 

 He added that while near-term profitability is important for the company, its main focus continues to be on long-term sustainable growth. 

 While Byju's did not disclose the valuation of the company, industry watchers estimate it to be over $3.6 billion (Rs 25,763 crore). 

 ""The ed-tech industry is undergoing massive shifts, students today want to learn through engaging and interactive methods. We are pioneering 'better learning for tomorrow' with technology as an enabler, and have been working towards making students active learners,"" he said. 

 Launched in 2015, Byju's has 30 million students cumulatively learning from its application and over 2 million annual paid subscriptions. 

 In June this year, Byju's had said it has crossed Rs 100 crore in monthly revenue and had revised its revenue targets for this year to Rs 1,400 crore. 

 Last year, Byju's had announced raising an undisclosed amount in funding from China's Tencent Holdings and Belgium-based investment firm Verlinvest. In 2016, it had raised $50 million (about Rs 332.3 crore) from a clutch of investors, led by Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) and Sequoia Capital. 

 To date Byju's has raised funds from Naspers, CPPIB, General Atlantic, Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, Tencent, Sequoia Capital, Sofina, Verlinvest, IFC, Aarin Capital, Times Internet and Lightspeed Venture Partners.

'No tax benefit on house sale if new flat is in wife's name' - Times of India

","
MUMBAI: The Income-Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT)'s Mumbai bench recently denied a taxpayer I-T benefits available when long-term capital gains arising from sale of a residential property are invested in a new house. The sole reason for the denial was that the taxpayer bought the new house in his wife and adult daughter's names.


In a similar case, the Delhi HC had taken a view favourable to the taxpayer. ITAT's Mumbai bench, though, was bound by the decision of the Bombay HC, which had taken a contrary view and held that the new property must be owned by the taxpayer or he or she must have legal title over it. 



Capital gains exemption valid even if housing loan used for new house: ITATThe Kolkata bench of the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) has held that investment-linked capital gains tax exemption, which is available on purchase of a new house, cannot be denied merely because the taxpayer has taken a housing loan.


The I-T Act's Section 54 gives two years from the sale date to invest long-term capital gains from the old house in a new house to get tax relief. 

 ""Those taxpayers who are within the jurisdiction of the Bombay high court must be careful to avoid tax litigation. If the taxpayer wishes to register a new house in the name of his or her spouse and children, it would be wiser to also add his or her own name to it. In such an instance, at least a proportionate deduction (say, one third of the cost of the new house if registered jointly with names of a spouse and a child) would be available to the taxpayer,"" says Puneet Gupta, director, People Advisory Services at EY-India.

Under the I-T Act, if a taxpayer makes a profit on sale of a residential house held for at least two years, then such profit is treated as long-term capital gain (LTCG). This gain is taxable at 20% with adjustment for inflation which is referred to as indexation benefit.

If the LTCG component is invested in another house in India within the stipulated period though, then the gain's taxable component is reduced to the extent of this investment, which results in lower tax outgo. Under I-T Act's Section 54, the period prescribed for investing LTCGs in a new house is two years from the date of the old house's sale. This tax benefit is also available if the taxpayer constructs a new residential house within three years of the old house's sale.

In the case which ITAT recently heard, R Gavankar sold a house which he owned jointly with his wife and did not offer to tax any capital gains. I-T authorities assessed 50% of the LTGC of Rs 17.5 lakh in his hands. His claim for deduction under Section 54 was denied. Lower tax authorities, including commissioner of I-T (appeals), held that to avail benefits under this section, the taxpayer must own or have the legal title of the new property.

Gavankar contended before ITAT that Section 54 is a beneficial provision and the I-T benefit should be available to him.

Singapore court charges 4 NRIs over lighting fireworks on Diwali - Times of India

","
SINGAPORE: Four Indian-origin men were charged by a Singapore court on Saturday for lighting fireworks on Diwali. 


 Lighting of fireworks has been banned in the country since 1972. 

 The four were involved in three three separate incidents -- illegal fireworks in the housing estates of Yishun, Bukit Batok West and Joo Seng Road on Tuesday, the day Singaporeans celebrated Diwali or deepavali. 

 A Hariprasanth, 18, Elvis Xavier Fernandez, 25, Jeevan Arjoon, 28, and Alagappan Singaram, 54, are accused of discharging dangerous fireworks, reported The Straits Times Saturday. 

 On Wednesday, two other Singaporean men of Indian-origin were charged over their alleged involvement in an illegal fireworks display in Little India on Diwali eve. 

 Thaigu Selvarajoo, 29, is accused of letting off dangerous fireworks while Siva Kumar Subramaniam, 48, allegedly abetted him. 

 Jeevan allegedly let off fireworks at an open field in front of Block 504B Yishun Street 51 at around 3.30 am on Tuesday. 

 Police said they were alerted to loud sounds in the area that morning and found cylinders containing explosive materials. They arrested Jeevan the next day. 

 Hariprasanth and Singaram are accused of discharging a box of ""25 Shot Cake"" at an open space adjacent to Block 194B Bukit Batok West Avenue 6 at around 7.40 pm on Tuesday. 

 According to court documents, Fernandez is said to have discharged a bundle of six ""whistling fire sparkles"" at Block 18 Joo Seng Road about three hours later. Officers arrested him on Thursday. 

 The four men charged on Friday were each offered bail of SGD 5,000. 

Jeevan will be back in court on November 23, while Fernandez will return five days later. 

 The cases involving Hariprasanth and Singaram have been adjourned to November 30. 

 Selvarajoo and Siva Kumar have been remanded at Central Police Division and will be back in the court on November 14. 

 Court documents did not reveal how they obtained the fireworks, according to The Straits Times. 

 The government started regulating the use of fireworks in 1968 when the practice of lighting celebratory fireworks became a serious public safety issue. A total ban was rolled out on August 1, 1972. 

 Police said, ""Members of the public are reminded that it is an offence to possess, sell, transport, send, deliver, distribute or import any dangerous fireworks."" 

 ""The police have zero tolerance against acts that endanger the lives or safety of others as well as cause undue alarm to the public and will not hesitate to take action against those who blatantly disregard the law,"" they said. 

 Offenders convicted of discharging dangerous fireworks can be jailed for up to two years and fined between SGD 2,000 and SGD 10,000.

Outcome of climate talks in Poland positive: India - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: India on Sunday termed ""positive"" the outcome of climate talks in Poland as it sets nations on the path for successful implementation of the historic Paris Agreement, and asserted it engaged in the negotiations ""constructively"" while protecting the country's key interests.


Negotiators from nearly 200 countries earlier Sunday finalised a set of rules that will make the 2015 Paris deal to curb global warming operational in 2020, after a two-week summit. The outcome of the talks in the mining city of Katowice aims to limit the rise in global temperature to well below 2C.

""India considers the outcome of COP-24 a positive one which addresses concerns of all parties and sets us on the path towards successful implementation of the Paris Agreement,"" an official statement said.

The conference was significant as it focused on three key issues — finalization of guidelines, modalities and rules for the implementation of the Paris deal, the conclusion of 2018 Facilitative Talanoa Dialogue and the stocktake of pre-2020 actions implementation and ambition.

However, a leading Indian environment advocacy group termed the rulebook ""weak"" and ""completely insufficient"". It said the COP's refusal to take the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's report on 1.5C seriously undermines the Paris Agreement.

Chandra Bhushan, the deputy director general of Centre for Science and Environment, said in Katowice the rulebook ""is completely insufficient to drive ambitious climate action.""

In New Delhi, India said the country demonstrated commitment and leadership during COP-24 by reaffirming its promise to implement the Paris deal in its spirit and to act collectively to address climate change.

""India engaged positively and constructively in all the negotiations while protecting India's key interests including recognition of different starting points of developed and developing countries, flexibilities for developing countries and consideration of principles including equity and Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC),"" according to the statement.

India said the guidance on Nationally Determined Contributions preserves the nationally determined nature of NDCs and provides for Parties to submit different types of contributions including adaptation.

""The overall guidance reflects the principles of the Paris Agreement and recognises the leadership that developed countries have to display for achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement,"" the statement said.

India said the guidance on adaptation recognizes the adaptation needs of developing countries and is built on the overarching principle of CBDR-RC.

India said the guidance on finance provisions operationalises the obligation of developed countries in providing means of implementation to developing countries and recognises the need for climate finance to be new and additional and climate specific.

""Parties have also agreed to initiate the work on setting up the new collective finance goals post-2020 from the floor of USD 100 billion,"" it said.

The overarching framework for technology recognises the need for enhanced support towards operationalisation of the framework and ""comprehensively"" covers all stages of technology development and transfer,"" it said.

India said it engaged in a ""meaningful"" way in the 2018 Facilitative Talanoa Dialogue and stocktake exercise on Pre-2020 implementation and ambition.

The Talanoa Dialogue is a process designed to help countries implement and enhance their NDCs by 2020.

""The outcome on dialogue also recalls the commitment of developed country Parties to a goal of mobilizing jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020.

""It also notes with concern the current, urgent and emerging needs related to extreme weather events and slow onset events in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change,"" it said.

Mars InSight lander seen in first images from space: Nasa - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: A camera aboard Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has captured the image of the InSight lander, which recently touched down on the Red Planet.


The InSight lander, its heat shield and parachute were spotted by HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) in one set of images taken on December 6, and again on December 11.

The lander, heat shield and parachute are within 1,000 feet of one another on Elysium Planitia, the flat lava plain selected as InSight's landing location, Nasa said in a statement.

This is not the first time HiRISE has photographed a Mars lander. InSight is based largely on 2008's Phoenix spacecraft, which the camera aboard MRO captured on the surface of Mars as well as descending on its parachute.

While the HiRISE team at the University of Arizona also tried to take an image of InSight during landing, MRO was at a much less opportune angle and was not able to take a good picture.

Why the Great Indian Rope Trick isn’t a myth - Times of India

","
Everyone has heard of the great Indian rope trick, but I am probably the only person who has actually seen it performed.


It was many years ago, when I was wandering around in the small towns of North India, making a living by writing the occasional story or newspaper article and staying in cheap hotels or small rented rooms.

I was visiting Kalsi on the road to Chakrata, with the intention of writing a piece on the rock edicts of the great King Ashoka, edicts which had survived on stone for thousands of years.

On a hillock nearby, a small but lively crowd had collected — mostly village folk from the surrounding farmlands — and like most rustic folk, they were more interested in magic than in history. Come to think of it, so was I!

The object of their interest was a man in a mustard-coloured robe, accompanied by a skinny young boy wearing nothing but a loincloth or langoti. With the help of his acolyte, the man had been performing various feats of magic, to the amusement of the gathering.

The magician claimed that he could invert the order of nature, and someone in the crowd challenged him to produce out of thin air, a bunch of coconuts, well knowing that coconuts grew by the sea and not in the Himalayan foothills.

“Well, you won’t find coconuts growing here,” said the magician, “but perhaps there are some to be found above the clouds, in the land of the gods.”

“But how are we to fetch them?” asked the boy.

“I have the means,” said the man and proceeded to take from a large round tin box a cord some tens of feet in length. After carefully arranging the cord he threw one end of it high up in the air — and there, to everyone’s astonishment, it remained as if caught by something. He now paid out the rope, which kept going up higher and higher until it disappeared in the mist, leaving only a short length in his hands.

He then told the crowd that as he was too heavy to climb the rope himself, he would ask the boy to do so. And handing the end of the rope to the boy, he told him to go ahead.

At first the boy demurred, saying that if he fell from a great height, he would surely be killed. But on being thumped on the head by his angry mentor, he seized the rope and swarmed up it, looking rather like a small spider running up a hanging thread on a web!

In a few moments, the boy was out of sight, and the crowd fell silent, wondering what would happen next.

Presently down fell a large coconut, a real coconut, which the pleased magician presented to someone in the crowd. It was followed by several more coconuts.

Then suddenly the rope came down, without the boy and the magician shrieked, “Someone has cut the rope! What will my boy do now?”

A minute later, down came the boy’s head. It bounced on the ground like a coconut. This was followed by the boy’s arms, legs and body all falling on the ground one after another.

The mesmerised crowd had been watching these rattling events in horror and amazement when suddenly the lid of the tin box flew open and the boy popped out and bowed to the crowd.

A cheer went up and coins were thrown to the smiling performers. The performers thanked the crowd with folded hands.

How had they done this trick — if indeed it was a trick? Mesmerism, hypnotism, the powers of suggestion? 

The coil of rope was back in its box, the fallen limbs were nowhere to be seen.

As the magician passed me, he smiled and held out a coconut, which I took in both hands. It seemed to quiver as I held it!

Then as I looked down at the coconut, I saw it change into a human face. Two eyes looked out at me and a wide mouth broke into a sly grin. This transformation lasted only for seconds and then it was a coconut again.

I dropped the coconut. It rolled away and was seized upon by several street urchins who made off with it.

I turned to see if the magician was still around, and was just in time to catch a glimpse of the man and the boy and the tin box as they disappeared into the crowd — into the mystery and multitude that was India.

Making the most of the task, contestants are seen voicing out their thoughts which they have held onto for past so many weeks. While, Surbhi Rana calls Deepak Thakur dual-faced, Sreesanth tells him that he is very good at playing with people’s emotions. Dipika Kakar tells Deepak he forgot humanity while playing game and even if he goes on to be a winner for her he will be the biggest failure. 

That’s not all when Surbhi Rana sits with headphone, Deepak calls her fake and a chameleon who changes colours. Sreesanth, who has never got along well with Surbhi taunts her by saying that she betrayed his trust and misused it when he confided in her about the slap-gate controversy to make her the captain.

The task is played for ticket to finale and whoever wins it will directly enter finale.

It will be interesting to see if the housemates are able to survive the testing time and who wins the ticket to finale.

Virat Kohli: We wanted Anil Kumble to continue but he wanted to quit after his fallout with skipper Virat Kohli: Laxman 

","
VISAKHAPATNAM: BCCI's Cricket Advisory Committee member and batting legend VVS Laxman Friday said the their panel wanted Anil Kumble to continue as India's coach but the former captain was bent on quitting after his fallout with skipper Virat Kohli last year.


Reflecting on the tumultuous phase that gripped Indian cricket during last year's Champions Trophy, Laxman said the episode left a ""bitter taste in the mouth"".

""I don't think Kohli crossed the line. We at the CAC thought Anil should continue as coach but he thought the right decision was to quit and move ahead. It left a bitter taste in the mouth,"" Laxman said at the 'India Today South Conclave'.

The CAC, comprising Laxman, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly, picked Kumble as national coach in 2016.

However, the appointment didn't quite work out as Kumble and Kohli's difference of opinions spiralled into a full-blown public fallout which culminated into Kumble stepping down.

The former captain went on to say that his relationship with Kohli had become untenable.

""What I did not like was the way he was getting bad press during the Champions Trophy. The CAC wanted Anil to continue and the entire episode was very unfortunate, Laxman said.

""I always tell people CAC are not marriage counsellors. We were tasked with selecting the best possible job. We did a very elaborate process - unfortunately, Virat Kohli and Anil Kumble did not work out,"" he added.

Markets take a breather; global stocks slide on Fed rate hike - Times of India

","
MUMBAI: Snapping a seven-day rising streak, equity benchmarks finished with mild losses Thursday amid a broad reversal across global markets following Fed's rate hike.


The BSE Sensex, which had dropped more than 250 points in morning trade, finally finished 52.66 points, or 0.14 per cent, lower at 36,431.67.

The broader NSE Nifty slipped 15.60 points, or 0.14 per cent, to 10,951.70.

World markets tumbled after the US Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate for the fourth time this year, and signalled more next year, albeit at a slower pace than expected. The quarter-point increase, to 2.25-2.5 per cent, lifted the Fed's key rate to its highest point since 2008.

A rebound in the rupee and softening crude oil prices cushioned the fall for the domestic markets, traders said.

Major gainers in the Sensex pack were Yes Bank, Hero MotoCorp, M&M, Asian Paints, Sun Pharma, Tata Motors, L&T and HDFC Bank, rising up to 3.93 per cent.

Losers included Bharti Airtel, SBI, Wipro, Vedanta, Maruti Suzuki, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and Reliance Industries, falling up to 2.18 per cent.

PSU bank stocks were the biggest losers on both exchanges, after the government sought Parliament's approval for additional gross expenditure of Rs 85,948.86 crore, about half of which is for capital infusion in public sector banks through recapitalisation bonds, during the current fiscal.

On a net basis, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth Rs 1,209.21 crore Wednesday, and domestic institutional investors (DIIs) were net sellers to the tune of Rs 481.46 crore, provisional data available with BSE showed.

Globally, the Fed's move came despite US President Donald Trump's attacks in the recent weeks on its rate hikes and on chairman Jerome Powell personally. The president had complained that the moves are threatening the economy.

At a news conference after the Fed's announcement, Powell said Trump's tweets and statements would have no bearing on the central bank's policymaking.

Elsewhere in Asia, Korea's Kospi fell 0.90 per cent, Japan's Nikkei plunged 2.84 per cent, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.94 per cent and Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.52 per cent.

In Europe, Frankfurt's DAX fell 0.84 per cent and Paris' CAC 40 shed 1.33 per cent in their early deals. London's FTSE too slipped 0.84 per cent.

Know why women tend to outlive men - Times of India

","
Scientists have long wondered why women outlive men globally. Now, they have found that the secret may lie in the second X chromosome, present in females.

The study, conducted on mice, showed that females live longer than males, and that XX largely governs this trait in ageing mice. 

The researchers from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) gave experimental mice four different combinations of chromosomes and gonads: the two found in nature -- XX with ovaries and XY with testes -- and two others created in the laboratory -- XX testes and XY ovaries. 

The X chromosome contains many genes related to the brain, and it is crucial for survival. Without at least one X, an animal cannot live. 

The Y chromosome, present only in males, contains very few genes other than those that create secondary sex characteristics, like male genitals and facial hair, and it is not necessary for survival.

""We've long wondered what causes female longevity,"" said Dena Dubal, Associate Professor at the UCSF.

""One can imagine nature has driven females to evolve this way. When you're living longer, you can really ensure the well-being of your offspring, and maybe even their offspring,"" Dubal added.

The study, published in Aging Cell, found that the XX mice lived longer than the XY mice, whether either one had ovaries or testes. But the mice that lived the longest had ovaries, in addition to two X chromosomes - in other words, they displayed natural female mouse biology.

Further, having XX ovaries enabled mice to live longer, beginning at 21 months, which is toward the end of a normal mouse lifespan.

But for the laboratory mice who were genetically female but hormonally male -- two X's plus testes -- the second X chromosome only protected them from dying earlier in life without extending their lives beyond the normal mouse lifespan. 

These benefits trailed off by the time the mice were 23 months old, the researchers noted.

US Senate passes bill to avert shutdown - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: The US Senate has approved a legislation to temporarily fund the government in an effort to avoid a partial shutdown just before Christmas after President Donald Trump backed away from his demand for money for a border wall with Mexico.


Senators on Wednesday passed the measure, which would keep government running to 8 February.

The House of Representatives needs to pass similar bill to avoid a government shutdown this weekend. House, in which the Republicans currently has a majority, is expected to pass the bill, but unlikely to include funding for the border wall.

Unless the issue is resolved, more than 800,000 federal workers would face furloughs or be forced to work without pay, disrupting government operations days before Christmas.

Democratic Leader and Speaker-designate, Nancy Pelosi, said her party would support the bill to avert government shutdown. The House is likely to pass the bill on Thursday, before it heads to the President Donald Trump to sign it into law.

Trump said in an Oval Office meeting with top congressional Democratic leaders last week that he would be ""proud"" to shut down part of the government in service of forcing Congress to give him the full $5 billion he wants for a border wall.

The administration appeared to soften its stance on Tuesday when White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Fox News, ""At the end of the day we don't want to shut down the government.""

The border wall was central to Trump's presidential campaign.

""The American people know the president's wall is ineffective, expensive, and only serves as a political bone to his most conservative supporters – certainly not worth a government shutdown,"" Senator Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader, said.

""It's good that Republicans in the Senate finally realised that they should not shut down the government over a wall that does not have enough support to pass the House or Senate and is not supported by a majority of the country,"" Schumer said.

""It is unfortunate that Trump's demand for a border wall from sea to shining sea has held up seven appropriations bills that have been debated and passed out of committee on a bipartisan basis,"" said Senator Dick Durbin.

Maharashtra BJP survey finds 2014 Lok Sabha wave ebbing, Sena crucial to success 

","
MUMBAI: According to an assessment based on a recent internal BJP survey, even if the party contests the 2019 Lok Sabha election in alliance with the Shiv Sena, a repeat of the 2014 performance is not likely in the state. The BJP-Shiv-Sena combine had secured 41 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in the state in the 2014 election. After a bypoll loss, BJP has 22 of the 48 seats, the Sena has 18, the Congress holds two, the NCP has 5, and one seat is held by the Swabhimani Paksha. 


""If we contest the Lok Sabha polls jointly, we will win fewer than 30 to 34 seats and if we contest separately, the BJP may win 15 to 18 seats, while the Shiv Sena will be able to secure five to eight seats. In that event, the Congress-NCP combine will win 22 to 28 seats,"" a former BJP minister said. The survey was conducted among the rank and file of the party across the state. The former BJP minister said party president Amit Shah was insistent on an alliance with the Sena to boost the tally for both parties. ""Shah felt that all-out efforts should be made to reach out to Shiv Sena and ensure that BJP-Shiv-Sena repeats the 2014 performance.""



Sena MP Sanjay Raut declined to comment on the tie-up. The BJP leadership has of late expressed optimism that the alliance is on course.

The former BJP minister said one of the Sena’s conditions for the alliance may be the appointment of a chief minister from its fold after the state assembly election irrespective of its seat numbers. “I am told that the Shiv Sena has asked the BJP leadership to accept the Karnataka formula in Maharashtra,” the former minister said. “In Karnataka, while the Congress secured more seats, still it accepted the leadership of the Janata Dal.”

NCP spokesman Nawab Malik said the recent debacle of BJP in the Hindi heartland was a pointer. “Whether there is an alliance between the BJP and the Shiv Sena or not, we are sure the Congress-NCP combine will secure 38 seats, while the Shiv-Sena-BJP combine will secure 10 seats,” he said. State Congress chief Ashok Chavan endorsed the view. “There is no Modi wave; I’m sure it’ll be the best performance by the Congress-NCP,” he said.

World Cup winners France organised yet unexciting, says Xavi 

","
BARCELONA: Former Spain and Barcelona midfielder Xavi has said France's World Cup triumph this year left him feeling ""unenthusiastic"" due to their style of play.


Didier Deschamps' side, containing the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Antoine Griezmann and Paul Pogba, beat Croatia 4-2 in an action-packed final in Moscow after beating Argentina 4-3 in the tournament's stand-out game in the last 16.

They also saw off Uruguay and Belgium on their way to the final.

Yet their performances left Xavi, one of the heroes of Spain's 2010 World Cup win and a four-times Champions League winner with Barca, unimpressed.

""All France say to me is that they are the champions,"" Xavi said in an interview with Spanish newspaper Marca published on Friday.

""They are an organised team, not very exciting, but they have a lot of qualities. They work hard, they counterattack like rockets, you have Griezmann and Mbappe running back to defend. That's fine, but it doesn't make me feel enthusiastic.""

Xavi, who is seeing out his career in Qatar with Al Sadd and has said repeatedly he intends to become a coach when he retires from playing, also criticised the short-term attitudes of coaches at World Cups.

""In a World Cup coaches are more practical because they are scared of being knocked out. You make one error, and 'ciao',"" he added.

""I'm of a different school of thought, believing you should always try to have the ball and take risks but 70-80 percent of teams in a World Cup don't take risks and they wait for a chance to score. It's a shame. The result is what justifies the means and convinces fans, but it doesn't convince me.""

#MeToo movement: Alok Nath’s lawyer says Vinta Nanda’s allegations are imaginary 

","
It wouldn’t be wrong to say that actress Tanushree Dutta Dutta’s allegations of sexual harassment against Nana Patekar was somewhere the beginning of #MeToo movement in India, especially Bollywood. Many prominent names have come up who have been accused of sexual misconduct. And one of the shocking names has been that of Alok Nath. 

According to reports in India Today, a hearing took place in the Vinta Nanda and Alok Nath case yesterday where the senior actor’s advocate DN Goburdhun, has lashed out at Vinta Nanda and called her a delusional complainant and a woman who drank alcohol, indulged in drugs and had relationships with married men with children. 
He reportedly said that she probably wanted some unrelenquished love from the actor and quashed her complaint as mere publicity. Not just this, the advocate also said that Vinta wanted to create marital discord between Nath and his wife as she forced the veteran actor to shoot a kissing scene in the serial at one point of time two decades ago despite the actor’s objection as his wife did not approve of such scenes.

D N Goburdhun has also reportedly termed the writer-producer's rape allegation an imaginative story and that she did not cooperate with the police during the investigation and was busy attending film festivals.

To all these allegations, Nanda's lawyer Dhruti Kapadia reportedly objected saying that he only wanted to do character assassination of Vinta.

Infographic: Students from these 10 B-schools are highest-paid - Times of India

A survey among 26,699 MBA students, alumni, and recruiters in 2018 about their goals and experiences show that 9 out of the top 10 B-schools in the world are from the US when it comes to overall global rankings and all 10 from USA when it comes to compensation. Survey respondents overwhelmingly identified compensation—the potential for high-paying work after graduation — as their No. 1 factor in choosing a business school. Compensation is weighted more heavily than other factors in determining the overall rankings. (Networking, Learning, and Entrepreneurship indexes make up the rest of the ranking.) The global survey found that currently employed MBA graduates from US schools had median compensation of $145,000 a year, 16% more than the $125,000 for graduates of non-US schools.

Goodbye naagin dance. Hello Ambani-style sangeet - Times of India

","
Not everyone can have Beyoncé perform or Salman as a back-up dancer but couples are dropping a few lakhs on elaborately choreographed events with aerial acts and lavish sets
If you’ve been lapping up videos from recent celebrity weddings, one thing is clear: the sangeet is no longer a small, intimate affair with impromptu performances by friends and relatives. No longer is one member of the family who briefly took Shiamak Davar dance classes tasked with teaching everyone how to dance to Bole Chudiyan. Now, you hire a professional choreographer, fork out a few lakhs so that the aunty with two left feet and the uncle who shows off his naagin dance can shimmy like a Bollywood star.

They may not be able to get Beyoncé or Salman Khan but that doesn’t stop couples from putting up a show that boasts of everything from aerial performers to scores of backup dancers and lavish sets. Choreographers Swati Joneja and Sherry Sharma of Twirls and Thumkas say they have done their share of grand Bollywood-scale productions with 80 background dancers. “Our productions are like musicals, it’s not just back-to-back dances, we also use pre-recorded visuals, background dancers and props for the family. A lot of couples want grand entrances and we help them feel like stars,” says Joneja. The performances they put up range from 45 minutes to 2 hours.




Aayushi Jain, who got married earlier this year, kept aside a budget of Rs 3 lakh for the sangeet and interviewed close to six choreographers before narrowing it down to Twirls and Thumkas. “Our first meeting with them was about seven hours long, and we talked about how I met my husband and our story. We practised for a month and the team came to both Vizag, where I was, and Delhi, where my husband was, to help us,” she says.

Couples are not necessarily looking to replicate the experience of a Bollywood movie, but they want the evening to feel closer to the dhamaka and pizzazz of an awards show. Rishi Sharma, a choreographer whose company Balle Balle Baaliyan offers aerial acts where performers gracefully dance while dangling from ropes in the air, says production values have gone up along with expectations. “People are exposed to so many dance reality shows and Bollywood movies and they want their performances to be on that level. The aerial act that we offer costs about a lakh because of the technical challenges it involves,” he says.

Wedding planner Mukta Kapoor of Yuna Weddings agrees that the sangeet has become much more opulent. “People want to entertain the audience, and want something different, like flash mobs and pre-recorded videos.”

Another emerging trend is a themed evening. From a Bigg Boss themed sangeet (where the bride’s grandmother recorded Bigg Boss-inspired voice overs) to the ‘from retro to metro’ theme where the songs go from old to new, people want to stand out from the crowd.

People want to put on an enviable and entertaining evening, and with that desire comes a bigger budget. Nirmiti Jhaveri of Lights Camera Dance, a Mumbai-based wedding choreography studio, says they charge about Rs 6,000 per performance, and the average sangeet has at the very least 10 performances. She says, “There is definitely a hunger to be different. Every couple comes to us and says that they want something out of the box.”

Raghuvir Singh has been in the wedding business for 29 years. In that time, he has seen the meteoric rise of the sangeet as a significant event, so much so that his company BMP Weddings has started offering in-house choreography services. “Nowadays the sangeet is a very big deal. In the last five years, and the last 2-3 years in particular, it has blown up. Now, a choreographer for your sangeet is compulsory,” he says.

Think what you may about the manic quest to put on a show of a lifetime, it has opened up opportunities for dancers. Delhi-based Prabhu Kumar of More than Thumkas says, “The most money one can make as a dancer is through wedding choreography. If you teach dance at a studio or academy, they barely pay you. That’s why every dancer is becoming a wedding choreographer.”

Mehak Shahani, co-founder of wedding planning portal Wed me Good, says that the trend not only results in entertainment for those watching, but helps the families bond. She says, “At the end of the day, weddings are about two families coming together. What’s a better bonding experience than dance? The competitiveness between the girl’s side and boy’s side also adds an element of fun to it.”

IIT ropra water pollution: IIT-Ropar makes low-cost device to check water pollution 

","
CHANDIGARH: Officials of the Punjab Pollution Control Board may soon be spared the tasked of collecting samples from water bodies to check the level of pollution in them. 


This is because the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Ropar, has developed a low-cost device which monitors, reads and disseminates the level of pollution in a water body in real time.

By using pollution sensors, the device measures total dissolved solids (TDS), potassium hydrogen (pH) value, chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD) and temperature of a water body, and shares the data with the help of a GSM device and microcontroller to a smartphone or any device connected with internet. The system raises an alarm when the level of pollutants are found to be more than permissible limits on a particular stretch. Developed by a team led by Dr Narinder Singh, associate professor, and assistant professors Dr Suman Kumar and Dr Vinayak Hande, the device has been tested successfully.

Explaining the device’s functionality, Dr Singh said different types of sensor were used to measure various parameters. The device will send the information to a computer or smartphone as per the frequency set wirelessly using internet.

An app has been developed to read the collected data on a smartphone. “The device will automatically collect the data on a set time and will go in sleep mode once the data is shared,” shared Dr Suman Kumar.

The team has made efforts to keep the device’s cost down by using low-cost sensors, GSM device and microcontroller. After making a few modifications, the team will file a patent to make, use and sell the device commercially.

Water pollution has emerged as one of the biggest problems in Punjab in recent years. As per the Central Pollution Control Board, a majority of the water bodies in the country are polluted. Industrial waste and untreated sewage are the biggest source of water pollution.

In May this year, Punjab witnessed its worst contamination of water, caused by a molasses leak in the Beas river. 

Dr Singh said the device will help authorities keep a real-time check on level of pollution in rivers caused by industries and take corrective steps. “The government will know how much pollution an industry is causing,” said Dr Singh.

Balbir Singh Seechewal, who is at the forefront of anti-river pollution campaign in Punjab, said the situation had worsened in Punjab in recent years and such devices could be of great help to authorities.

New health app to send alerts for unhealthy lifestyle choices - Times of India

","
KOLKATA: A research team at IIT-Kharagpur is developing a mobile application which can monitor day-to- day activities and smoking habits of an individual and make suitable recommendations.


The sensor-based health app will send alerts to the user, warning him about his unhealthy lifestyle choices, an IIT-KGP statement said Thursday.

The new tracking kit, being developed by Rajendra Mishra School of Engineering Entrepreneurship at IIT- Kharagpur, can also go a long way in gauging addictive and depressive behaviour, it said.

""The technology, once integrated with a smartphone or a fitness band, will prepare a daily activity chart based on body movements and predict functions such as eating and drinking. The application can also monitor call and message logs and smartphone usage,"" the statement said.

Ram Babu Roy, assistant professor at (RMSoEE), said the application will provide personalized services after data analysis.

""We did a pilot study on four participants. The research team collected GPS data as well other location-based information and took note of their physical movement. It helped us create health and behavioural profiles of the individuals,"" Roy, who is leading project, said.

The app will be able to process data in different environments and demarcate between ""normal and abnormal activities"", he added.

Astronauts land from ISS stint marred by air leak, rocket failure - Times of India

","
MOSCOW: Three astronauts landed back on Earth on Thursday after a troubled stint on the ISS marred by an air leak and the failure of a rocket set to bring new crew members.


A Soyuz spacecraft ferrying Alexander Gerst of the European Space Agency, NASA's Serena Aunon-Chancellor and Sergey Prokopyev of Roscosmos landed safely in Kazakhstan, Russia's space agency said.

""There's been a landing... The crew of the manned Soyuz MS-09 has returned safely to Earth after 197 days,"" Roscosmos said on Twitter.

The spacecraft landed slightly ahead of schedule at 0802 Moscow time (0502 GMT), Roscosmos said on its website.

""The crew feels well after returning to Earth,"" the space agency said.


ЕСТЬ ПОСАДКА! Добро пожаловать домой, «Алтаи»! Экипаж пилотируемого корабля #Союз МС09 благополучно вернулся на Зе… https://t.co/nEVaIvPNFp— РОСКОСМОС (@roscosmos) 1545282325000

Live footage on the websites of NASA and Roscosmos did not show the landing of the astronauts' capsule due to thick fog over the snow-covered Kazakh steppe.

Rescuers pulled the crew members out of the capsule, with Prokopyev and Aunon-Chancellor appearing pale and weak due to the effects of long weightlessness, while Gerst beamed broadly and gave an interview to German television.

When the astronauts blasted off in June, they were one of the least experienced crews ever to join the International Space Station -- only Gerst had been on a space mission before, in 2014.

Gerst, who is from Germany, has now spent a total of 363 days on the ISS, a record for the European Space Agency. He is now flying to Cologne, the ESA said.

The first significant incident in the crew's mission came in August when astronauts detected an air leak in their Soyuz spacecraft, which was docked to the orbiting space laboratory.

They sealed the small hole successfully but Russia launched an investigation and its space chief Dmitry Rogozin suggested it could have been deliberate sabotage carried out in space.

Rogozin said that investigators ruled out the possibility the defect was introduced during the spacecraft's manufacture.

Prokopyev and fellow Russian Oleg Kononenko last week carried out a gruelling space walk lasting almost eight hours to locate the hole from the outside and record and bag evidence.

The hole was in a section of the astronauts' spacecraft that was to fall away and burn up in the atmosphere as they landed, hence the need to carry out the probe in space.

During the space walk, Kononenko said there was some kind of black and yellow ""furry"" deposit that looked like a ""spider"" around the hole, but no conclusion has been made public.

Prokopyev brought back the evidence to Earth and will hand it to the FSB security service which will carry out laboratory analysis, TASS state news agency reported citing a source.

Their landing back on Earth was originally planned for December 13 but the schedule was put back after the October failure of a Soyuz rocket carrying the next crew -- the first such aborted launch in the post-Soviet era.

Russia's Aleksey Ovchinin and US astronaut Nick Hague took off for the ISS on October 11 but their Soyuz rocket failed minutes after blast-off, forcing them to eject and make a harrowing emergency landing.

At the time Gerst wrote on Twitter that the astronauts' survival showed ""what an amazing vehicle"" the Soyuz rocket is.

""Spaceflight is hard. And we must keep trying for the benefit of humankind,"" he wrote.

The first successful launch of astronauts since the October accident took place on December 3, carrying Kononenko, Anne McClain of NASA and David Saint-Jacques of the Canadian Space Agency.

Bigg Boss 12 is witnessing the entry of popular celebs inside the house as the finale approaches. The house welcomed former contestants Pritam Singh and Manu Punjabi who came into the house as special guests.

In the new preview it is shown that they were given a special task wherein, Manu and Pritam asked housemates to name a person who they wish to send into the kaal kothri (jail). Surbhi took Sreesanth’s name for being aggressive and Deepak countered it saying that she can’t blame someone for aggressive when she herself does the same.

Pritam and Manu then go on to question the housemates to name a person who is dual faced and they take Karanvir Bohra’s name. Manu then suggests them to send KV to jail. This irks him and he refuses to go to jail and walks off from the living area. Currently, Karanvir doesn’t have any confidant in the house and his equation too has turned sour with most of the housemates.

Karanvir and Sreesanth were seen interacting with a popular RJ in last night’s episode (December 20). During their conversation they blamed each other for many things and even got into an argument. Karanvir even stated that Dipika Kakar has got overshadowed by Sreesanth in the game.

Death of cow given more significance than that of the police officer, says Naseeruddin Shah; gets trolled 

","
In an apparent reference to the recent mob violence in Uttar Pradesh, actor Naseeruddin Shah said death of a cow is being given more importance than killing of a policeman and was soon trolled for his remark. The actor said the ""poison has already spread"" and it will be now difficult to contain it. 



Quick Edit: Naseeruddin Shah speaks out on India’s culture of impunity



""It will be very difficult to capture this djinn back into the bottle again. There is complete impunity for those who take law into their own hands. In many areas we are witnessing that the death of a cow is more significance than that of a police officer,"" he said. 

A user commented on the YouTube video shared saying,""I think Gulfam Hasan's character played by him in 'Sarfarosh' is actually his real character. Anti-Indian elements are using social media very shrewdly."" 

The comment was in reference to his character in the 1998 action-drama, in which he played a Pakistani singer who aids cross-border terrorism in the garb of spreading music. 

""This is the same guy who signed mercy petition of Yakub Memon. Problem is within you Mr Gulfam Hassan #Nasiruddinshah,"" another user wrote on Twitter. 

""Criminals and corrupt have to fear in India. Go to Pakistan #NaseeruddinShah,"" another user commented. 

Shah also expressed anxiety over the well-being of his children Imaad and Vivaan with actor Ratna Pathak Shah, saying they have not brought up their sons as followers of any particular religion. 

""I feel anxious for my children because tomorrow if a mob surrounds them and asks, 'Are you a Hindu or a Muslim?' they will have no answer. It worries me that I don't see the situation improving anytime soon. 

""These matters don't scare me, they make me angry. And I feel every right-thinking man should feel angry, not scared. This is our home, who dare evict us from here?"" he said in the interview. 

A user said if that is the case, ""why doesn't he get out of here?"" 

The actor was also trolled recently for his comment on cricketer Virat Kohli where he called the Indian skipper ""world's worst behaved player."" 

Interestingly, the actor posted an update on Facebook, hours after his criticism of Kohli, writing, ""Patriotism is often the cry extolled when morally questionable acts are advocated by those in power. - Chelsea Manning, activist.""

Donald Trump throws Kabul, New Delhi under the bus with Afghan withdrawal move

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump is ordering an American drawdown in Afghanistan, bringing home some 50 per cent of the 15,000 US troops over the next two months. The move will effectively throw the Afghan government under the bus, and beyond that, endanger Indian presence, investment, and stakes in the country, since it is expected to open the floodgates for the return of Taliban and other Pakistani terrorist proxies. 


Trump’s decision to start withdrawing from Afghanistan, which even some American experts described as a defeat, comes on the heels of a similar 

  departure from Syria he announced abruptly over Twitter

Trump falsely tweeted that Mattis was “retiring,” but the General, who was sometimes referred to as the only adult in cabinet who could counsel the mercurial President, sent a resignation letter that laid bare their differences, including the broader issue of treatment of allies and the real threats to the United States.

“My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues,” Mattis wrote. “We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances,” he added, clearly implying Trump was not doing it. 

“Because you have the right to a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position,” the departing Defense Secretary, who met his Indian counterpart Nirmala Sitharaman four times this year for talks, said. 

The US President remained unconcerned even as the foreign policy and strategic establishments had a meltdown in the hours after announcement, as he battled to secure funding for a border wall from the Congress in the face of a looming government shutdown, engendering jokes that the greatest military in the world was good for only tackling refugees and asylum-seekers. 

“Getting out of Syria was no surprise. I’ve been campaigning on it for years, and six months ago, when I very publicly wanted to do it, I agreed to stay longer. Russia, Iran, Syria & other are the local enemy of ISIS. We were doing [their] work. Time to come home & rebuild,” he explained over Twitter, as he was excoriated by even Republican lawmakers and many conservative talking heads, save a few isolationists. 

Trump did not refer to the Afghanistan drawndown, but he asked, “Does the USA want to be the Policeman of the Middle East, getting NOTHING but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who, in almost all cases, do not appreciate what we are doing? Do we want to be there forever?”



Does the USA want to be the Policeman of the Middle East, getting NOTHING but spending precious lives and trillions… https://t.co/fNDrsdz1RJ— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1545307014000

The US involvement in Afghanistan has lasted 17 years and Trump has often expressed doubts about the utility of American troops there, evidently untutored over the 1990s vacuum that led to the rise of the Al Qaida and the 9/11 catastrophe, which has been the basis for the interventionist argument espoused by the likes of Mattis and other top US Generals, as also many leading US Senators, including Republicans. 

“The conditions in Afghanistan – at the present moment – make American troop withdrawals a high risk strategy. If we continue on our present course we are setting in motion the loss of all our gains and paving the way toward a second 9/11,” warned Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a key Trump ally on the domestic front.

The Afghan drawdown became imminent the moment Trump announced the Syria withdrawal with many analysts turning their attention to the fertile ground that gave rise to Al Qaeda and 9/11 much before ISIS appeared on the scene.

“How do you think the US precipitous withdrawal in Syria is viewed by the Taliban? The Taliban must smell blood in the water. Why would it compromise when it sees the US so eager to leave? Since when is negotiating from a position of weakness (the US) considered a clever tactic?” asked Bill Roggio of the Long War Journal, referring to recent US efforts to negotiate with the Taliban often without keeping Kabul in the loop.

Others recorded yet another episode of American inconsistency and unreliability. “If stories about US drawdown from #Afghanistan are true, Pres Trump will have done exactly what Pres Obama did: Send troops in, only to withdraw them prematurely, thereby proving the #Taliban’s maxim: Americans have watches, we have time,” Husain Haqqani, Pakistan’s former ambassador to the US, noted sagely.

The youth’s father too sustained injuries as he jumped out on noticing his son was sucked under the train.

Vikram brought them to Carmelaram station where the train arrived at platform no. 1 at 8.56pm and stopped for a minute.

Vikram entered the AC compartment where his parents’ seat had been reserved. Even as he took their luggage till their seats, he noticed the train had started moving. He wished them happy journey in a hurry and rushed to get off the train.

“Vikram jumped out of the train, but in a direction opposite to which it was moving. He lost control and fell in the gap between the moving train and the platform; he came under the wheels. His legs, hands and head were severed from his body. Seeing Vikram fall, Vijayan too jumped out of the moving train and sustained severe injuries,” a police officer said.

Fellow passengers pulled the chain to stop the train, which is when Udaya Kumari alighted from it and came to know of the tragedy.

Vijayan was rushed to a nearby private hospital in Marathahalli. Police said he is out of danger.

Byappanahalli railway police shifted Vikram’s body to Bowring & Lady Curzon Hospital, where the postmortem was conducted on Tuesday morning.

Shah Rukh Khan opens up about his preparations for playing the vertically challenged Bauua Singh in 'Zero' 

","
The most awaited film of the year, Shah Rukh Khan starrer '
Zero' has finally hit the screens today and people can't keep their excitement hidden. With the holiday season just about to begin, SRK has dropped the right gift for his beloved fans. Helmed by Anand L. Rai, 'Zero' also stars Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif in lead roles along with many other celebrity cameo appearances. Shah Rukh Khan is playing a vertically challenged person for the first time.



Also See: Zero Movie Review
Speaking about his preparations to play Bauua Singh on-screen, Shahrukh revealed that the idea was to see if a vertically challenged person could make anyone else feel shorter than him.

The actor had to concentrate on his body language very much. SRK had to take smaller strides as if he moved at his regular pace, it would appear that he is moving too fast when matched with Bauua. The actor also told that while shooting for the dance sequence with Salman Khan, he had to dance slower to match his steps.

VFX was also a big challenge while shooting for the movie. The makers were left deliberating on various scenes whether they got it right or not. SRK also said that he believes the concept of character consistency is crap. The character would do what the makers wanted it to. So, they retained the discrepancies.

Armaan Kohli secures bail in illegal alcohol possession case - Times of India

","
Actor Armaan Kohli, who was arrested on Thursday evening for allegedly stocking alcohol beyond permissible limit, secured bail in the case on Friday. 
A team of excise police officials raided Armaan’s Juhu home on Thursday and found Scotch whisky stocked beyond permissible limit. According to law, a person cannot possess more than 12 units of hard liquor in a month. The actor was taken to the excise department Q division’s Bandra office for further questioning later in the evening. He appeared before the Bandra court yesterday and was granted bail in the case. 

An official from the excise police department informed BT, “We raided Armaan Kohli’s home and seized 41 unopened bottles and 35 empty bottles of Scotch whisky, which is beyond the permissible limit. He was taken for further questioning and appeared before the court yesterday around 11 am.”

After securing bail, Armaan told BT, “I have secured bail for a bond of `20,000. I returned from Dubai on Tuesday and, along with six friends, bought 12 bottles of whisky from duty free, as I was planning to host a party a few days later. I have the required liquor permit and duty-free license. Unlike what has been claimed, I just had around 40 bottles, of which 19 were unopened. I spent the night at the Bandra excise office. I appeared before the court on Friday around 11.30 am and was granted bail on the basis of the proof I produced.” He adds, “Clearly, someone is after my life and wants to tarnish my image.”

This is not the first time Armaan has landed himself in a legal tangle. He was earlier accused of assaulting his ex-girlfriend Neeru Randhawa, and later, a family friend Nadia Hayat had lodged an FIR against him for threatening and verbally abusing her.

Infographic: Students from these 10 B-schools are highest-paid - Times of India

Compensation is weighted more heavily than other factors in determining the overall rankings. (Networking, Learning, and Entrepreneurship indexes make up the rest of the ranking.) The global survey found that currently employed MBA graduates from US schools had median compensation of $145,000 a year, 16% more than the $125,000 for graduates of non-US schools.

PSB officers on strike, protesting merger, seeking wage hike - Times of India

","
MUMBAI: Around 3.20 lakh officers from various state-run banks are a one-day strike on Friday seeking immediate wage revision and opposing the proposed merger of Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank with Bank of Baroda. 


The union also wants the wage revision, which is pending since November 1, 2017, for employees from scale 1-7. 

Bank managements have mandated the industry lobby Indian Bank Association (IBA) to negotiate for scale 1-3. 

""The IBA is also not coming forward to structure the 11th bipartite wage negotiations based on our charter of demands by discussing the wage revision for officers from scale 1-7 and also based on the concept of minimum wages as envisaged in the seventh Central pay commission report,"" All-India Bank Officers Confederation (AIBOC) general secretary Soumya Datta said. 

He said after 13 months of negotiations between the unions and IBA, the latter has offered a wage revision of 8 just percent. In the past wage settlement, which was for the period November 1, 2012 to October 31, 2017, the employees got a 15 percent hike. 

The IBA has also offered a variable pay based on the operating profit and return on assets. 

""Most banks are in losses due to large NPAs but for this an employee can't be held responsible,"" Datta said. 

The union is also opposing the proposed merger Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank with Bank of Baroda, saying this will not help the merged entity to tackle any of the problems it is facing, including the NPA menace. 

Meanwhile, the United Forum of Bank Unions has called for one-day strike on December 26 to protest against the proposed merger. 

This union is an umbrella body of nine unions, including All-India Bank Officers Confederation, All-India Bank Employees Association and the National Organisation of Bank Workers among others.

Arun Jaitley: PSBs to get fresh equity of Rs 83,000cr 

","
NEW DELHI: The government on Thursday announced a significant rampup in its capital infusion plan for public sector banks (PSBs), with Rs 83,000 crore to be provided over the next few months, taking the recapitalisation amount during the current financial year to Rs 1.06 lakh crore.


The statement from finance minister Arun Jaitley came hours after he sought Parliamentary nod for a fresh capital infusion of Rs 41,000 crore, over and above the Rs 65,000 crore he had budgeted for. So far, Rs 23,000 crore has already been released by the ministry.



The demand for fresh funds for PSBs was part of the supplementary demand for grants moved in Parliament, which entails an additional spending of around Rs 86,000 crore although the cash outgo would be limited to Rs 15,000 crore. It also includes fresh equity of Rs 2,300 crore for cash-guzzler Air India, which had received Rs 1,630 crore earlier in the fiscal year.

Financial services secretary Rajiv Kumar told reporters that priority will be to provide funds to three-to-four banks that are not fully compliant with RBI norms related to NPAs and capital but have not slipped into the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework (for weak banks that would inhibit their ability to expand). The other focus segment is banks that have shown improvement on some of the PCA parameters and are now profitable such as Corporation Bank and Bank of Maharashtra.

The fund allocation would also be linked to the ability of these banks to raise equity from the market and also get rid of noncore assets. “This (fund infusion) will increase the lending capacity of public sector banks as well as help some of them come out of RBI’s watch list,” Jaitley said.

LJP to contest on 6 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar; announcement on Saturday 

","
NEW DELHI: After some hard bargaining by the Lok Janshakti Party, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar is understood to have sealed a seat-sharing deal for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls with the BJP and the Janata Dal-United contesting an equal number of 17 seats each leaving the rest of the six seats to the party headed by Ram Vilas Paswan.


In a bid to retain the LJP in its fold, the BJP is also believed to have agreed to give a Rajya Sabha seat from its quota to the party.

The seat-sharing arrangement is likely to be made public on Saturday in the presence of BJP chief Amit Shah, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and LJP supremo Ram Vilas Paswan. 

The LJP national spokesperson Sanjay Saraf told IANS, ""It has been decided that our party would contest six Lok Sabha seats in Bihar and get one Rajya Sabha berth."" 

Earlier in the day, Union Minister Arun Jaitley held discussions with Ramvilas Paswan and his son Chirag Paswan over seat sharing arrangements in Bihar for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

The discussion came a day after LJP leaders met BJP President Amit Shah and shared their concerns over the delay in holding talks over the seat sharing issue.

After the meeting with Jaitley, LJP Parliamentary Board Chairman Chirag Paswan expressed the hope that talks would move in the right direction.

""Talks are going on. An announcement will be made at an appropriate time. We have put our points before the BJP leadership and the important thing is that we are being heard. Hope everything will be fine,"" he told reporters.

His uncle, Ram Chandra Paswan, who also attended the meeting said that the LJP would remain part of the NDA.

""We are and will remain in the NDA. Seat sharing will be announced this week,"" Ram Chandra Paswan said. 

""The party, which is having strongholds in any specific area, should be respected. We are a small party. We need adequate time for preparation. That's why we wanted the issue to be resolved at the earliest,"" he told reporters.

Sources in the BJP said a final arrangement of seats would be formalised after a meeting of the BJP and LJP leaders with Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who is in Delhi.

A Bharatiya Janata Party leader also claimed that talks were going in the right direction and everything will be finalised soon.

In the last Lok Sabha polls, the BJP had contested from 30 seats and won 22, while the LJP won six seats and lost one. The Rashtriya Lok Samta Party (RLSP), which is now a part of the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan (Grand Alliance) in Bihar, bagged three. 

In 2014, the Janata Dal-United (JD-U) had contested on its own but performed poorly. It had won only two seats.

On Thursday, BJP leader and Bihar in-charge Bhupendra Yadav first went to meet Chirag and Ram Vilas Paswan and the three leaders later went to the residence of Amit Shah. They were joined there by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.

The BJP and the Nitish Kumar-led JD-U had declared earlier that they would contest an equal number of seats in Bihar in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

'State support for terrorist proxies will not be tolerated': US's veiled warning to Pakistan - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: The US has told all its regional partners, including Pakistan, that state support for terrorist proxies will not be tolerated, the Pentagon has said, expressing concern over the free movement of some militant groups in Pakistan that are presenting security challenges for Afghanistan.


The Pentagon, in its semi-annual Afghan report to the US Congress that covers the period of June to November 2018, said on Thursday that Taliban and the Haqqani Network retain freedom of movement in Pakistan.

The Pentagon's remarks came amidst reports that President Donald Trump is planning to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan.

In the report, the Pentagon said that Afghanistan faces a continuing threat from an externally supported insurgency and the highest regional concentration of terrorist groups in the world.

""In this reporting period, the US continued to call on regional partners to reinforce our messages that state support for terrorist proxies will not be tolerated, that cross-border cooperation between Afghanistan and Pakistan is essential, and that the Taliban cannot achieve its objectives through continued military conflict,"" the Pentagon said.

""Although Pakistani military operations have disrupted some militant sanctuaries, certain groups — such as the Taliban and the Haqqani Network — retain freedom of movement in Pakistan. The United States continues to convey to all levels of Pakistani leadership the importance of taking action against all terrorist and militant groups,"" it said.

According to the report, the Haqqani network continues to be an integral part of the Taliban's effort to pressure the Afghan government in Kabul and eastern Afghanistan.

Sirajuddin Haqqani's role as a Taliban deputy probably increased Haqqani influence within the Taliban leadership, and resulted in an increase in Haqqani influence to areas outside its normal operating areas of Paktika, Paktiya, and Khost provinces in eastern Afghanistan, it said.

The Afghanistan-Pakistan border region remains a sanctuary for various groups, including the Taliban, al-Qaeda core (AQ), al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), the Haqqani Network (HQN), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), ISIS-K, East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU).

Terrorist sanctuaries on both sides of the border present security challenges for Afghanistan and Pakistan and pose a threat to regional security and stability, the report said.

The South Asia Strategy, which was announced by Trump in August 2017, has focused on pressuring Pakistan to limit support and safe-haven for proxy terrorist and militant groups and to play a constructive role in facilitating Afghan reconciliation, the Pentagon said.

""Regional efforts in the South Asia Strategy aim to expand burden sharing, neutralize potential spoilers to US and coalition efforts, limit threats to the United States and our allies and partners, and develop and support a durable political settlement in Afghanistan,"" the Pentagon said.

The South Asia strategy prioritises regional engagement to limit hedging against the Afghan government and create an international consensus for peace.

The Pentagon said the existence of more than 20 terrorist or insurgent groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan requires an Afghan-supported US platform in the region to monitor, contain, and respond to these threats.

#MeToo movement: Alok Nath’s lawyer says Vinta Nanda’s allegations are imaginary 

","
It wouldn’t be wrong to say that actress Tanushree Dutta Dutta’s allegations of sexual harassment against Nana Patekar was somewhere the beginning of #MeToo movement in India, especially Bollywood. Many prominent names have come up who have been accused of sexual misconduct. And one of the shocking names has been that of Alok Nath. 

According to reports in India Today, a hearing took place in the Vinta Nanda and Alok Nath case yesterday where the senior actor’s advocate DN Goburdhun, has lashed out at Vinta Nanda and called her a delusional complainant and a woman who drank alcohol, indulged in drugs and had relationships with married men with children. 
He reportedly said that she probably wanted some unrelenquished love from the actor and quashed her complaint as mere publicity. Not just this, the advocate also said that Vinta wanted to create marital discord between Nath and his wife as she forced the veteran actor to shoot a kissing scene in the serial at one point of time two decades ago despite the actor’s objection as his wife did not approve of such scenes.

D N Goburdhun has also reportedly termed the writer-producer's rape allegation an imaginative story and that she did not cooperate with the police during the investigation and was busy attending film festivals.

To all these allegations, Nanda's lawyer Dhruti Kapadia reportedly objected saying that he only wanted to do character assassination of Vinta.

Saturn losing its iconic rings rapidly: Nasa - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: Saturn's iconic rings are being rapidly pulled apart into a dusty rain of ice particles under the influence of the planet's magnetic field, Nasa scientists say.


At this rate, the Saturn's rings are likely to disappear in the next 100 million years.

""We estimate that this 'ring rain' drains an amount of water products that could fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool from Saturn's rings in half an hour,"" said James O'Donoghue of Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in the US.


Researchers found that the rings are draining away toward the planet as a dusty rain of ice particles. https://t.co/HxPXqHlWN5— NASA Goddard (@NASAGoddard) 1545068707000


""From this alone, the entire ring system will be gone in 300 million years, but add to this the Cassini-spacecraft measured ring-material detected falling into Saturn's equator, and the rings have less than 100 million years to live,"" said O'Donoghue, lead author of the study published in the journal Icarus.

""This is relatively short, compared to Saturn's age of over 4 billion years,"" he said.

Scientists have long wondered if Saturn was formed with the rings or if the planet acquired them later in life.

The new research favours the latter scenario, indicating that they are unlikely to be older than 100 million years, as it would take that long for the C-ring to become what it is today assuming it was once as dense as the B-ring.

""We are lucky to be around to see Saturn's ring system, which appears to be in the middle of its lifetime. However, if rings are temporary, perhaps we just missed out on seeing giant ring systems of Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune, which have only thin ringlets today,"" O'Donoghue said.

Various theories have been proposed for the ring's origin. If the planet got them later in life, the rings could have formed when small, icy moons in orbit around Saturn collided, perhaps because their orbits were perturbed by a gravitational tug from a passing asteroid or comet.

Saturn's rings are mostly chunks of water ice ranging in size from microscopic dust grains to boulders several metres across.

Ring particles are caught in a balancing act between the pull of Saturn's gravity, which wants to draw them back into the planet, and their orbital velocity, which wants to fling them outward into space.

Researchers showed that glowing bands in Saturn's northern and southern hemispheres where the magnetic field lines that intersect the ring plane enter the planet. They analysed the light to determine the amount of rain from the ring and its effects on Saturn's ionosphere.

They found that the amount of rain matches remarkably well with the astonishingly high values derived by scientists over three decades earlier, with one region in the south receiving most of it.

Mumbai hospital fire: Food delivery boy joins rescue work, saves 10 lives 

","
MUMBAI: Sidhu Humanabade (20) was out delivering food for Swiggy on Monday evening when he saw 

  smoke billowing out of Kamgar Hospital
 + in Marol. He joined the rescue operations immediately and managed to save 10 patients. “Unfortunately, two patients fell down even as I helped them on to the ladder,” said the youth from his bed in Seven Hills Hospital, Andheri, where he has been admitted for inhaling soot. 
 

“I kept a ladder on the third-floor window ledge for an elderly woman to climb down but the ledge collapsed as soon as she got on to the ladder. I could do nothing as she plunged down,” said the youth. “We have to help others in distress, there is no question of being frightened to help out,” he said, recalling how he scaled five storeys along with firemen to rescue people from the ESIC hospital.

When Sidhu rushed to the Kamgar Hospital, he could hear screams of people seeking help. “I climbed using the fire brigade’s ladder and had to use stones to break the glass facade in order to reach the people.” He stood on window ledges and got on to the floors to help people get on to the ladder even as the smoke made it difficult to see clearly or breathe easily.

It was over three hours after the rescue operation that he told the firemen that he was feeling a pain in his chest. “I had tried to wear a handkerchief on my face but it was lost later,” said Sidhu, who had his first meal in 15 hours on Tuesday. A doctor who attended on Sindhu said he would be fine soon. 

A Class X pass-out, Sidhu grew up in Airoli and had just moved in with his uncle in Andheri for the Swiggy job. His brother Chandrakant told TOI: “When we reached the hospital, we found him on oxygen support and being given fluids via IV.” Chandrakant said their parents weren’t surprised to hear that Sidhu had helped people. “He is always doing this.” 

Meanwhile, the food in Sidhu’s bike was intact. “His chappals were there too, but someone took away our helmet,” added Chandrakant.

BJP rath yatra Bengal: Calcutta high court puts BJP's rath yatra in West Bengal on hold for now 

","
KOLKATA: A division bench of the Calcutta high court on Friday quashed a single bench order that had allowed BJP's 'Rath Yatra' in West Bengal and asked it to hear the case afresh to consider intelligence inputs by state agencies.


The single-judge bench of Tapabrata Chakraborty was asked to dispose the matter expeditiously after considering whether there were adequate materials to arrive at the conclusion to allow the 'yatra' as proposed by the BJP.

The division bench said the order needs to consider afresh with the 36 intelligence inputs submitted by the state government before the single bench.

Advocate General Kishore Dutta, representing the state, said that the single bench had not considered the intelligence inputs submitted to it in a sealed cover and had returned it to him without even opening it.

He had submitted intelligence inputs from 31 police districts and five police commisionerates before the bench, which he said talked about apprehension of communal unrest if the BJP's proposed roadshows were allowed.

The 'Rath Yatra', which was originally scheduled to start on December 7 but was denied permission by the state government, has become the latest political flashpoint between the saffron party and the state's ruling Trinamool Congress.

After hearing an appeal by the BJP, a single-judge bench of the high court had on Thursday allowed the mega event, to be flagged off by BJP president Amit Shah under a re-scheduled programme from December 28 to 31.

The West Bengal government, however, challenged the ruling before a division bench of Chief Justice Debasish Kargupta and Justice Shampa Sarkar, which has now quashed the earlier ruling and sent the case back to the single-judge bench.

In its appeal, the government expressed urgency and sought immediate hearing of the matter.

Setting aside the denial of permission by the state government, the single-judge bench had allowed the 'yatra' while noting that courts can interfere if administrative authorities exercise their discretionary powers in a whimsical manner.

Following the court order, the BJP had come up with tentative new dates for its proposed three-phase programme.

After the new order, there is uncertainty once again over the mega event that was to cover all 42 Lok Sabha constituencies in the state ahead of the 2019 general elections.

Earlier on December 6, the same single-judge bench had refused permission to the BJP to hold the 'Rath Yatra', which was scheduled to be flagged off by Shah from Cooch Behar on December 7. The party had then approached the division bench.

The division bench had then asked the state chief secretary, the home secretary and the director general of police to hold a meeting with representatives of the BJP and take a decision on the 'yatra' by December 14.

After parleys with the BJP team, the three officers refused permission for the rallies on December 15 on grounds that they might lead to communal tensions.

Following this, the state BJP had moved the court of Justice Chakraborty again challenging the government's denial of permission and had got a go-ahead on Thursday.

Indian techie sentenced to nine years in prison for sexual assault inside plane - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: An Indian techie from Tamil Nadu was sentenced to nine years of imprisonment on Thursday on charges of a ""brazen sexual assault"" against a fellow female passenger inside a commercial airplane early this year.


Prabhu Ramamoorthy, 35, who came to the US on a H-1B visa in 2015, will be deported after he serves his sentence, a federal court in Detroit said as it sentenced the Indian national to nine years of imprisonment.

Judge Terrence Berge hoped it would be grave enough to deter others from committing similar crimes. Federal prosecutors had sought 11 years of imprisonment for Ramamoorthy.

""Everyone has the right to be secure and safe when they travel on airplanes. We will not tolerate the behaviour of anyone, who takes advantage of victims who are in a vulnerable position. We appreciate the victim in this case for her courage to speak out,"" US Attorney Matthew Schneider said after the sentencing was announced.

Ramamoorthy was convicted in August after a five-day trial that was conducted before United States District Judge Terrence Berg. The jury deliberated approximately three-and-a-half hours before returning the guilty verdict.

According to the evidence presented at the trial, on January 3, Ramamoorthy had engaged in a sexual act with a female, while she was sleeping on a flight from Las Vegas to Detroit. Ramamoorthy was seated along with his wife, when he sexually assaulted his co-passenger.

During the trial, the government admitted evidence demonstrating that Ramamoorthy had digitally penetrated the woman sleeping next to him during the overnight flight. The sexual assault woke her up, she found her pants unbuttoned and unzipped, and sought help from the flight attendants.

The sentence was proof that the safety and security of all aircraft passengers was a priority for the FBI, said Timothy R Slater, Special Agent in Charge, Detroit Division of the FBI.

In recent years, a number of Indian nationals have been arrested or charged with sexual assaults inside a plane. The FBI says airplane sexual assault is a serious offence that is on the rise. FBI statistics indicate that investigations of mid-air sexual assaults increased by 66 per cent from 2014 to 2017.

That was in part due to increasingly ""cramped, confined spaces; alcohol and drugs; fewer flight attendants; and dark cabins on night flights"" -- factors that ""likely embolden offenders"" -- the FBI said in a recent report.

The cramped style of airplane seating can exacerbate trauma for victims. According to mental health professionals, victims who are violated in confined spaces feel even more helpless, vulnerable and powerless. Victims may also feel intimidated by the person sitting next to them since the seating arrangement means that the perpetrator is effectively blocking the victim from getting up, according to the FBI.

According to court papers, Ramamoorthy is from Tamil Nadu, where he grew up. His parents are farmers. He came to the US in July, 2015 after his graduation to work as an IT professional.

During his trial, Ramamoorthy presented himself to the court as a confused man stranded in America without English language skills despite his sophisticated technological job, federal prosecutors alleged. ""His lack of empathy and remorse should not go unnoticed by this court,"" they argued, seeking nearly 11 years of imprisonment for him.

London's Gatwick airport reopens after drone saboteur sows chaos - Times of India

","
LONDON: London's Gatwick Airport reopened on Friday after a saboteur wrought 36 hours of travel chaos for over a hundred thousand Christmas travellers by using a drone to play cat-and-mouse with police snipers and the army.


After the biggest disruption at Gatwick, Britain's second busiest airport, since a volcanic ash cloud in 2010, Gatwick said 700 planes were due to take off on Friday, although there would still be delays and cancellations.

Britain deployed unidentified military technology to guard the airport against what Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said were thought to be several drones.

""What's happening on the ground is a mix of measures taken to give confidence that aircraft can be safe... Some of those are military capabilities,"" Grayling told BBC television.

Grayling said there was not yet ""a straightforward commercial, off-the-shelf solution that automatically solves all problems.""

There was mystery over the motivation of the drone operator, or operators, and police said there was nothing to suggest the crippling of one of Europe's busiest airports was a terrorist attack.

Gatwick's drone nightmare is thought to be the most disruptive yet at a major airport and indicates a new vulnerability that will be scrutinised by security forces and airport operators across the world.

The army and police snipers were called in to hunt down the drones, thought to be industrial style craft, which flew near the airport every time it tried to reopen on Thursday.

CHAOS

Gatwick's chief operating officer Chris Woodroofe said the perpetrator had not yet been found.

Flights were halted at 2103 GMT on Wednesday after two drones were spotted near the airfield. The disruption affected at least 120,000 people.

It was not immediately clear what the financial impact would be on the main airlines who operate from Gatwick including easyJet and British Airways.

After a boom in drone sales, unmanned aerial vehicles have become a growing menace at airports across the world.

In Britain, the number of near misses between private drones and aircraft more than tripled between 2015 and 2017, with 92 incidents recorded last year.

Flying drones within 1 km (0.6 mile) of a British airport boundary is punishable by five years in prison.

The drone sightings caused misery for tens of thousands of travellers who were stranded at Gatwick, many sleeping on the floor as they searched for alternative routes to holidays and Christmas family gatherings.

""There's no evidence that it is terror-related in the conventional sense,"" Grayling said. ""But it's clearly a kind of disruptive activity that we've not seen before. This kind of incident is unprecedented anywhere in the world.""

He said it was uncertain how many drones were involved but it appeared to be more than one.

""It's thought to be a small number of drones in the plural,"" Grayling said. ""It certainly wasn't a lot, it was the same small number of drones seen many times.""

'Brightest Comet' set to pass by Earth on December 16 - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: Stargazers are in for a treat as the ""brightest comet"" is set to make one of the 10 closest comet flybys of Earth in 70 years, and one may even be able to see it without a telescope on Sunday, Nasa said.


Although the comet known as 46P/Wirtanen will approach at a distant 11.4 million kilometres or 30 lunar distances from Earth, it's still a fairly rare opportunity.

Comet Wirtanen has already been visible in larger amateur telescopes, and while the brightness of comets is notoriously difficult to predict, there is the possibility that during its close approach comet Wirtanen could be visible with binoculars or to the naked eye, Nasa said in a statement on Friday.

""This will be the closest comet Wirtanen has come to Earth for centuries and the closest it will come to Earth for centuries,"" said Paul Chodas, manager of the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.

""This could be one of the brightest comets in years, offering astronomers an important opportunity to study a comet up close with ground-based telescopes, both optical and radar,"" he added.

First discovered by astronomer Carl Wirtanen in 1948, 46P/Wirtanen, with a width of 1.1 kilometres, orbits the Sun fairly quickly for a comet — once every 5.4 years — making it a short-period comet. (Long-period comets, on the other hand, have orbital periods greater than 200 years.)

At the time of closest approach, the comet will appear to be located in the constellation Taurus close to the Pleiades.

In a bid to take advantage of the close approach, astronomers led by the University of Maryland are planning an observation campaign.

The campaign would aid in detailed scientific study of the properties of this ""hyperactive"" comet which emits more water than expected, given its relatively small nucleus.

The comet will even pass through the observing field of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), Nasa said.

Indore doctor saves heart attack patient on plane 

","
INDORE:The paths of Indore doctor Akhilesh Dubey and Chennai’s Ananthraman would have crossed as they waited to board Indigo’s flight to Chennai on the night of December 14. The Tamilian wouldn’t have known then that his life would be in Dr Dubey’s hands only an hour later, 35,000 feet in the air.


Around 9.10pm, Ananthraman suffered a heart attack and slumped unconscious in his seat. His neighbour raised the alarm and the cabin crew immediately made an announcement, asking if there was a doctor on board. Dr. Dubey raised his hand and was taken to the man. “We had crossed Hyderabad and were on our way to Chennai, when the man suddenly fell unconscious,” Dubey, who is a consultant physician in Indore, told TOI. He found that the fellow flier’s pulse was missing and he was not breathing.

Heart patient out of danger after CPR

His body had also turned cold. I unbuckled his seat belt, laid him on the floor and started giving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR),” said the doctor. After about one and a half minutes of CPR, Ananthraman’s pulse returned and he started breathing said Dr Dubey. “As he came to his senses, I asked his name and also if he was diabetic or suffering from any other disease,” he said, adding that Ananthraman had mild fever.

On the doctor’s advice, the pilot sought permission for priority landing at Chennai, which was granted. An ambulance was waiting when the plane touched down and Ananthraman was taken to a hospital, where his condition is said to be out of danger. He had come to Indore to attend a wedding and was on his way back to Chennai. His guardian angel, Dubey, was headed for Tirupati.

PSB officers on strike, protesting merger, seeking wage hike - Times of India

","
MUMBAI: Around 3.20 lakh officers from various state-run banks are a one-day strike on Friday seeking immediate wage revision and opposing the proposed merger of Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank with Bank of Baroda. 


The union also wants the wage revision, which is pending since November 1, 2017, for employees from scale 1-7. 

Bank managements have mandated the industry lobby Indian Bank Association (IBA) to negotiate for scale 1-3. 

""The IBA is also not coming forward to structure the 11th bipartite wage negotiations based on our charter of demands by discussing the wage revision for officers from scale 1-7 and also based on the concept of minimum wages as envisaged in the seventh Central pay commission report,"" All-India Bank Officers Confederation (AIBOC) general secretary Soumya Datta said. 

He said after 13 months of negotiations between the unions and IBA, the latter has offered a wage revision of 8 just percent. In the past wage settlement, which was for the period November 1, 2012 to October 31, 2017, the employees got a 15 percent hike. 

The IBA has also offered a variable pay based on the operating profit and return on assets. 

""Most banks are in losses due to large NPAs but for this an employee can't be held responsible,"" Datta said. 

The union is also opposing the proposed merger Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank with Bank of Baroda, saying this will not help the merged entity to tackle any of the problems it is facing, including the NPA menace. 

Meanwhile, the United Forum of Bank Unions has called for one-day strike on December 26 to protest against the proposed merger. 

This union is an umbrella body of nine unions, including All-India Bank Officers Confederation, All-India Bank Employees Association and the National Organisation of Bank Workers among others.

Banned Steve Smith reveals details of ball-tampering debacle 

","
SYDNEY: Former Australia captain Steve Smith said on Friday he had not been involved in planning to tamper with the ball during the Cape Town Test against South Africa but took responsibility as a leader for failing to put a stop to it.


Smith, along with vice-captain David Warner and opening batsman Cameron Bancroft, was suspended for his part in the ball-tampering incident which shocked the cricket world and torpedoed Australia's sporting reputation.

Facing Australian media for the first time since his teary apology at a news conference at Sydney airport on March 29, Smith said he had learned of the plan when he overheard a conversation in the team's dressing room at Newlands.

""I think it’s been documented pretty heavily, sort of, what went on,"" he told reporters at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

""For me in the room, I walked past something and had the opportunity to stop it and I didn’t do it and that was my leadership failure.""

""It was the potential for something to happen and it went on and happened out in the field.""

""I had the opportunity to stop it at that point rather than say, 'I don’t want to know anything about it' and that was my failure of leadership. And you know I’ve taken responsibility for that.""

Smith declined to name the players involved but reiterated that he had told them, ""I don't want to know about it"", and then walked away.

Smith has kept a low media profile since the scandal, despite playing at Twenty20 tournaments in Canada and the Caribbean, and turning out for his Sydney club side Sutherland.

However, in recent weeks he has made gradual moves to rehabilitate his public image and joined his former Australia team mates at training sessions.


BRAND POWER

Smith has also tested the waters to see how his brand power has fared in the wake of the incident, linking up with the local arm of Britain's Vodafone Group to shoot an advertisement which played on his shame and hopes of redemption.

The commercial, and Smith's involvement in it, was criticised by some media pundits and generated mixed responses on social media.

Smith said he was getting paid for the campaign but also ""putting forward"" funds from it to Gotcha4Life, a local men's mental health charity.

The 29-year-old added that it had been tough at times watching Australia play from the sidelines and said he was determined to break back into the one-day side for the May 30-July 14 World Cup and the test team for the Ashes beyond that.

""I’m just moving forward day to day, doing what I need to do to prepare to hopefully get another opportunity to play for Australia and if that's the World Cup and Ashes, so be it,"" Smith told reporters at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

""No doubt the English crowd will be incredibly hostile. I'm ready for that if that happens.""

""I'll keep working hard and if I get that opportunity again, that'd be great.""

Australia, led by Smith's replacement as captain Tim Paine, are tied 1-1 in a four-Test series with India ahead of the third contest in Melbourne starting on Boxing Day.

Smith and Warner's bans will be lifted at the end of March, with Bancroft's expiring on December 29.

Indian-origin woman jailed for drunken scene on flight to UK - Times of India

","
LONDON: An Indian-origin woman has been jailed for six months in the UK for drunken behaviour on an aeroplane which caused a passenger to have a seizure.


Kiran Jagdev, an executive assistant based in the city of Leicester, had attempted to blame the crew of Jet2 airline for supplying her with alcohol during her flight from Tenerife in Spain back to the UK in January this year. Judge Philip Head “rejected” her excuse and decided to impose what he described as a “deterrent sentence” during a hearing at Leicester Crown Court this week.

The court was told that during a bumpy landing, the 41-year-old had started screaming ""we are all going to die"", causing further distress to passengers.

""The effect you had on other passengers must have been dreadful,"" the judge said.

""As the pilot was unable to put the craft down on the approach, that triggered a further foul-mouthed tirade where you shouted 'we're all going to die' for about 10 minutes,” he said.

According to the prosecutors, Jagdev had consumed between six and eight beers even before boarding the four-hour flight to East Midlands Airport. She then proceeded to drink a further four to six glasses of wine on the plane, using her own supply from her handbag when the crew refused her more drinks.

""She continued to ask cabin crew for a drink and they continued to refuse her and she was issued with an Air Navigation Order,"" Prosecutor Joey Kwong told the court.

After she was moved for kicking seats, causing a passenger to have a seizure, an off-duty police officer on the same flight offered to sit next to her to assist cabin crew but she began making ""vulgar"" comments to him.

She was arrested by police on landing and proceeded to direct abusive remarks at airport immigration authorities.

The air rage incident came days after Jagdev, was convicted of assault in Tenerife and handed down a suspended sentence, which involves a deferred jail term reliant on good behaviour.

""There isn't any excuse. We can't put the blame on anyone other than herself and she accepts that,"" her defence lawyer, Harbinder Lally, told the court.

The judge concluded: ""You are the author of your own and other people's misfortune.

""This demands a deterrent sentence so people who travel by air and get drunk will know there are consequences.""

US charges two Chinese over alleged state-sponsored hacking - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: The United States has charged two Chinese men it says hacked the computer systems of companies and government agencies in a dozen countries, in what Washington says was a wide-reaching state-backed campaign of cyber-espionage.


NASA and the US Navy were among those allegedly targeted in a programme the US Justice Department said also hit a major bank, telecom companies and healthcare providers in 12 countries.

The charges drew a furious response from Beijing, which accused Washington of ""fabricating facts"".

Deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein said China had repeatedly broken President Xi Jinping's 2015 pledge to halt cyberattacks on US companies and commercial infrastructure.

""It is unacceptable that we continue to uncover cybercrime committed by China against other nations,"" he said.

""We want China to cease its illegal cyber activities and honor its commitment to the international community.

""But the evidence suggests that China may not intend to live up to its promises.""

US ally Britain also joined the charge, with Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt saying Beijing continued to hack computer systems for commercial and economic motives.

""These activities must stop. They go against the commitments made to the UK in 2015, and, as part of the G20, not to conduct or support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property or trade secrets,"" he said.

American officials said evidence showed hackers had targeted Managed Service Providers (MSPs)- specialist firms that help companies manage their information technology systems- potentially giving them access to the computer networks of dozens of companies.

Individual firms were not named in the indictment, but the 45 victims in the United States included government agencies- NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the US Navy, from which the personal information of more than 100,000 personnel was stolen.

Internationally, the hackers are alleged to have broken into the computers of a major bank, three telecommunications or consumer electronics companies, mining and healthcare firms, and business consultancies.

Beijing lashed out at the claims, the latest in a roiling dispute over cybersecurity that pits China against the US and its western allies.

""The United States is fabricating facts, creating something from nothing, and unwarrantedly denouncing China on cybersecurity issues,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Friday.

Beijing said it had lodged an official protest over the charges and warned the US to drop the prosecution, ""to avoid serious damage to the relations between the two countries"".

The Justice Department said the two alleged hackers, Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong, worked for the APT10 group, which Washington, London and other allies say is backed by China's Ministry of State Security.

From at least 2006 to 2018, the APT10 Group ""conducted extensive campaigns of intrusions into computer systems around the world"", the Justice Department said.

APT10 stole ""hundreds of gigabytes"" of sensitive data and information from its targets, invading their systems through the hacked MSPs, it added.

The indictments of the two men came less than two months after the US charged 10 Chinese also allegedly linked to APT10- including two intelligence officers- over a five-year scheme to steal aircraft engine technology from US and French aerospace firms.

Those cases involved both hacking and recruiting insiders to steal data and IT system passwords.

Relations between Washington and Beijing are already frayed over trade, hacking and geopolitical issues.

In October, the Department of Justice obtained the unprecedented extradition of a senior Chinese intelligence official from Belgium to stand trial in the United States for running the effort to steal US aviation industry secrets.

In early December, Canada arrested an executive of leading Chinese telecom company Huawei at Washington's request.

The US plans to charge her with fraud related to sanctions-breaking business dealings with Iran.

Since then, China has detained Canadian citizens, in what observers say is an apparent bid to pressure Ottawa into releasing the Huawei executive.

And, according to reports, US officials believe Chinese government-linked hackers were behind the theft of data on some 500 million guests of hotel giant Marriott, first reported on November 30.

Last week, Bill Priestap, head of the FBI's counterintelligence division, told Congress that China's cyberattacks were part of a broad campaign against the US.

""The Chinese government is attempting to acquire or steal not only the plans and intentions of the United States government, but also the ideas and innovations of the very people that make our economy so incredibly successful,"" he said.

","
BEIJING: Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday said 
China-India relations are ""actively"" moving forward with deepening mutual trust and cooperation, as the foreign ministers of the two countries held extensive talks in New Delhi under a newly established framework.


In his message of congratulations to the first meeting of 'High Level Mechanism on Cultural and People-to-People Exchanges' being held in New Delhi, Xi said China and India are both ancient civilisations boasting long history and splendid culture.

Helping people write Instagram captions is now a career - Times of India

","
It may not seem like it, but Instagram is hard work. As soon you have that epic photo, you find yourself on the arduous journey to find the perfect witty/cute/funny caption. Sometimes it’s as easy as “Goa, November 2018, beer emoji” but what goes with a photo of the setting sun on a rare unpolluted Delhi day? You type and delete a hundred versions of the caption, only to save the picture in your drafts and postpone the struggle to tomorrow. Maybe you give over to the group chat — hoping that your friend’s creative juices are flowing more than your own. Or, you can use one of the many Instagram accounts and apps catering to the caption-challenged Instagrammers amongst us — and let them do all the work.

Surat-based entrepreneur Mridul Kothari, 24, started The Perfect Caption as a place to share things he was writing while mending a broken heart two years ago. It took a life of its own and now has a lakh-plus followers who visit the page to borrow captions on themes such as relationships, friendships and broken hearts. Kothari says, “The people following the page are between the ages of 16 and 26 mostly. This is when people are getting into and out of relationships.” Clearly, it’s working — going by the many people who tag the account when using captions such as ‘Your 'typing' gives me goosebumps’.

Over the last year, Indians have developed a number of apps that assist Instagrammers up their caption game. One such app is Nirav Ashara’s Captions for Instagram. Boasting 50,000 daily active users, the app has hundreds of categories, everything from beauty to business. Seventy percent of their expanding user base is Indian. “People struggle with Instagram captions, especially those who don’t know English. It’s for people who have an idea of what they want to say but don’t know quite how to put it,” says Rajkot-based Ashara.

Caption House run by Aniket Manjare stemmed from the 21-year-old student’s frustration with the tedious process of sourcing captions. His aim was to make his app a one-click affair. He says that besides people who are not fluent in English, even those with a good vocabulary are using these services. “They’d much rather look online for a caption because it’s easier and they think they’ll find what is ‘trending’.”

So what’s behind the race to create caption apps? Currently, all these are free and largely rely on advertising to monetise. But there is the promise of big money. A couple of months ago, American writer and ad exec Laura Belgray penned a viral article on how she is making as much as $950 (Rs 67,000) an hour for her Instagram motivational quote writing services. Closer to home, Kothari recently got an offer of Rs 1.5 lakh from a buyer in the US to purchase his Instagram page.

Some developers, including two students of Indian origin in the US, are going beyond templated captions. Issa Caption is a US-based app that uses machine learning to analyse an image, and then matches it with a relevant caption from their database. The brainchild of students Nathan Leung, Samay Shamdasani and Rohan Bhati, the captions they offer are from rap and hip-hop lyrics that correspond to a picture you upload on their app.

Bhati, an 18-year-old second generation Indian-American, says, “We saw the lengths people went to in order to ensure they had a good caption on the spot. Some people even had whole folders in their notes app filled with potential Instagram caption ideas.”

And rap lyrics, they thought, would appeal to youngsters who were looking for something different. They are now looking to include a number of music artistes, including from Bollywood, to cater to the Indian market.

Using similar technology is Auto Caption, an Indian app that uses image recognition technology to determine the various elements in a picture and finds you a relevant caption. Not only that, it also identifies the popular hashtags you can post relating to the image to guarantee more likes. Akash Nidhi, a Bangalore-based app developer, created Auto Caption with a few friends. Nidhi says the app is for those who, like him, post 3 to 4 pictures a week, and don’t always have something interesting to say. “Over the last few years, Instagram has really blown up in India,” he adds. 
Instagram’s user base in India is now 71 million monthly active users according to the latest data. And most of them are desperately searching for Insta-fame. “Users think Instagram can make them famous, and for that they need good captions,” Ashara says.


How to write a good Insta caption
* Don’t make it too long — no one needs every single detail about your cousin's sangeet
* Make it relevant to the photo, no selfies with unrelated motivational quotes
* Don’t use too many hashtags #please #instaplease 
* Use emojis to draw attention
* When in doubt, less is more

Virat Kohli: We wanted Anil Kumble to continue but he wanted to quit after his fallout with skipper Virat Kohli: Laxman 

","
VISAKHAPATNAM: BCCI's Cricket Advisory Committee member and batting legend VVS Laxman Friday said the their panel wanted Anil Kumble to continue as India's coach but the former captain was bent on quitting after his fallout with skipper Virat Kohli last year.


Reflecting on the tumultuous phase that gripped Indian cricket during last year's Champions Trophy, Laxman said the episode left a ""bitter taste in the mouth"".

""I don't think Kohli crossed the line. We at the CAC thought Anil should continue as coach but he thought the right decision was to quit and move ahead. It left a bitter taste in the mouth,"" Laxman said at the 'India Today South Conclave'.

The CAC, comprising Laxman, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly, picked Kumble as national coach in 2016.

However, the appointment didn't quite work out as Kumble and Kohli's difference of opinions spiralled into a full-blown public fallout which culminated into Kumble stepping down.

The former captain went on to say that his relationship with Kohli had become untenable.

""What I did not like was the way he was getting bad press during the Champions Trophy. The CAC wanted Anil to continue and the entire episode was very unfortunate, Laxman said.

""I always tell people CAC are not marriage counsellors. We were tasked with selecting the best possible job. We did a very elaborate process - unfortunately, Virat Kohli and Anil Kumble did not work out,"" he added.

'Justice' named Merriam-Webster's 2018 Word of the Year - Times of India

","
“Justice” is what most people sought on Merriam-Webster, among the world’s most popular dictionaries, as the U.S. publisher named that principle of being fair as the Word of the Year for 2018.

Users looked up the word 74 percent more often than in 2017, said spokeswoman Meghan Lunghi for the website, which claims to be “America’s most trusted dictionary.”

The surge was prompted by specific uses of the word such as “obstruction of justice,” after U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted in August that Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 election, the company said in a statement.

“It’s often familiar words for abstract concepts that are among the most looked up words,” said Emily Brewster, associate editor for Merriam-Webster, in the statement. “When common words like justice are used in contexts that are very specific, technical, or legal, people look them up in the dictionary for the detail and nuance that a definition can provide.”

“Justice” joined Dictionary.com’s “misinformation” and the Oxford English Dictionary’s “toxic” as top words of the year.

Other frontrunners for Merriam-Webster’s distinction, based on frequency of searches, were “nationalism,” “pansexual,” “lodestar,” “epiphany,” “feckless,” “laurel,” “pissant,” “respect,” “maverick” and “excelsior.”

Why RBI blocked Paytm bank’s new business - Times of India

","
BENGALURU: Why did the RBI ban Paytm’s payments bank from opening new accounts and e-wallets in August?


In a response to an RTI filed by TOI, the RBI for the first time has disclosed the reasons — four of them. The apex bank said the Noida-based company was in violation of know-your-customer (KYC) rules while on-boarding users. These precise violations are not clear.

The RBI was also not happy with the close relations between Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma’s One97 Communications and the entity that runs Paytm Payments Bank (PPB). The bank is owned 51% by Sharma, while the rest is owned by One97 Communications and its subsidiaries.

Payments banks are expected to maintain an arm’s length relationship with promoter group entities.

The RBI added that the payments bank failed to maintain the prescribed net worth limit of Rs 100 crore. It said the bank also violated the end-of-the-day Rs 1-lakh limit per account. Payments banks are not allowed to hold more than Rs 1 lakh in each account.

An email sent to the bank’s spokesperson on the RTI responses did not elicit any response. The central bank had first declined to provide this information to TOI, citing certain sections of the RTI Act, but reviewed its position after an appeal by this newspaper. RTIWala helped TOI in the process of filing the appeal.

Following the RBI ban on opening new accounts and ewallets, the bank’s then CEO Renu Satti resigned. In October, the bank announced the appointment of S K Gupta, a former NPCI and SBI executive, as CEO.

Payments banks have remained largely unsuccessful in the country. Despite all the fervour they initially generated, their total deposits were just under Rs 540 crore as of May 2018. Of the four payments banks in India, Airtel Payments Bank had deposits of Rs 307 crore, Paytm Payments Bank had Rs 194 crore, Fino Payments Bank had Rs 37 crore, and India Post Payments Bank had Rs 1.4 crore. The figures were part of an RTI response by the RBI to TOI.

With Serena William and actress Chrissy Teigen having shared their breastfeeding (and breast pumping) pictures earlier, what makes Rachel's 'normalising breastfeeding' unique? Breaking stereotypes and cheering breastfeeding advocates, The Notebook actress Rachel McAdams shot for a glossy magazine and agreed to get her photo with a breast pump published. High five!




        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Claire Rothstein Photographer (@clairerothstein) on Dec 18, 2018 at 1:11am PST


The photographer shared her picture on Instagram with a message: A million reasons why I wanted to post this picture. Obviously #rachelmcadams looks incredible and was quite literally the dream to work with but also this shoot was about 6 months post her giving birth to her son, so between shots she was expressing/pumping as still breastfeeding. We had a mutual appreciation disagreement about who’s idea it was to take this picture but I’m still sure it was hers which makes me love her even more. Breastfeeding is the most normal thing in the world and I can’t for the life of me imagine why or how it is ever frowned upon or scared of. I don’t even think it needs explaining but just wanted to put this out there, as if it even changes one person’s perception of something so natural, so normal, so amazing then that’s great. Besides she’s wearing Versace and @bulgariofficial diamonds and is just fucking major. Big shout out to all the girls

Talking about motherhood, the 40-year-old actress had said, “They say your life is not your own any more. But I had 39 years of me, I was sick of me, I was so happy to put the focus on some other person.""

No leniency to RCom if it defaults on dues, says DoT - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Telecom licence of debt-laden Reliance Communications (RCom) can be cancelled and its spectrum can be withdrawn if the company fails to make statutory and spectrum payments slated for early next year, top government officials have said. 


The buzz resulted in the RCom stock crashing nearly 10% by close of Wednesday's trade on the BSE.

The tough stance comes at a time when the proposed spectrum-trading deal between RCom and Reliance Jio is stuck in a logjam.

Jio is demanding a commitment from the department of telecom (DoT) that it should not be held liable/accountable for any dues that may be raised against RCom in relation to any 'past liabilities', which may arise after its deal. Jio's demand, made through an official letter, comes even as RCom has submitted a guarantee by way of a land parcel to meet any such liability.

Jio has demanded an assurance from DoT, but the latter refused to give any such undertaking. ""While we have given the deal a no-objection certificate, we cannot give any undertaking to Jio that grants them special protection in case RCom's land guarantee is not found to be sufficient. Either of the parties will have to pay, in case the situation so arises,"" an official said. It is estimated that RCom's liabilities towards DoT could be up to Rs 2,900 crore. 

Questions sent to RCom and Jio on the matter remained unanswered.

With troubles for RCom mounting, the government made it clear that no leniency can be accorded to the company in case it defaults on its statutory payments. The company will be required to pay its licence fee in early January for the October-December 2018 quarter.

Swiggy Funding: Swiggy gets $1bn funding, valuation zooms to $3.3bn - Times of India

","
BENGALURU: India's consumer internet companies continue to attract blockbuster funding rounds. On Thursday, online food-delivery platform Swiggy announced it has received $1 billion in a new round led by existing investor Naspers, the South African media giant. 


New investors include China's Tencent, owner of WeChat, and hedge funds Hillhouse Capital and Wellington Management. Existing investors DST Global, Meituan Dianping and Coatue Management also participated in this round, which saw some existing investors sell part of their stake.

The funding is said to have valued Swiggy at $3.3 billion - a sharp jump from the $1.3-billion valuation in June when it raised $210 million, and the $700-million valuation in February when it raised $100 million.




The new capital gives Swiggy more ammunition to take on Zomato, which is backed by Ant Financial, which is affiliated to China's Alibaba. According to industry estimates, Swiggy does about 25 million orders a month, compared to 16-17 million by Zomato. In October, Zomato raised $210 million from Ant Financial at an estimated valuation of $2 billion. Swiggy plans to use the fresh funds to enter new categories, including medicine and grocery delivery. The company said it will also bring more quality food brands closer to consumers and address gaps in supply through delivery-only kitchens for restaurant partners. The company plans to hire top-notch talent, especially for machine learning and engineering roles across mid and senior levels as it looks to focus on building a next-generation, AI-driven platform for hyper-local discovery and on-demand delivery. 

""As we add more firepower to our vision of elevating quality of life for urban consumers by offering unparalleled convenience, we're pleased that visionary global investors share our purpose and have made such a significant investment in our future,"" Swiggy CEO Sriharsha Majety said in a statement. Majety founded the company in 2014 together with his BITS-Pilani colleague Nandan Reddy. The two later got in touch with IIT-Kharagpur alumnus Rahul Jaimini who joined them as co-founder and CTO. 

Leading Indian consumer internet companies - including Paytm, Ola, Oyo, Byju's and PolicyBazaar - have received large funding amounts over the past year or so. Flipkart was bought out by Walmart in a deal that valued the former at $21 billion. Investors clearly believe these companies are fundamentally disrupting their respective markets, or creating large new ones. 

Larry Illg, CEO of food and ventures at Naspers, said Swiggy has grown its monthly orders by 10 times since Naspers first put money in the firm in April 2017. ""Now, nearly two years later, we have even more confidence Swiggy has the winning formula and will continue to build a leading business in the country. Swiggy has expanded throughout India to tier-1, -2 and -3 cities, and most importantly, is the most loved food delivery brand in India, providing the best service to consumers nationwide,"" he added.

Swiggy says it has over 50,000 restaurant partners spread across more than 50 cities with about 120,000 delivery partners. 

Naspers alone put in $660 million in the latest round. The South African company recently led another funding round of $540 million in education technology firm Byju's.

London's Gatwick airport reopens after drone saboteur sows chaos - Times of India

","
LONDON: London's Gatwick Airport reopened on Friday after a saboteur wrought 36 hours of travel chaos for over a hundred thousand Christmas travellers by using a drone to play cat-and-mouse with police snipers and the army.


After the biggest disruption at Gatwick, Britain's second busiest airport, since a volcanic ash cloud in 2010, Gatwick said 700 planes were due to take off on Friday, although there would still be delays and cancellations.

Britain deployed unidentified military technology to guard the airport against what Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said were thought to be several drones.

""What's happening on the ground is a mix of measures taken to give confidence that aircraft can be safe... Some of those are military capabilities,"" Grayling told BBC television.

Grayling said there was not yet ""a straightforward commercial, off-the-shelf solution that automatically solves all problems.""

There was mystery over the motivation of the drone operator, or operators, and police said there was nothing to suggest the crippling of one of Europe's busiest airports was a terrorist attack.

Gatwick's drone nightmare is thought to be the most disruptive yet at a major airport and indicates a new vulnerability that will be scrutinised by security forces and airport operators across the world.

The army and police snipers were called in to hunt down the drones, thought to be industrial style craft, which flew near the airport every time it tried to reopen on Thursday.

CHAOS

Gatwick's chief operating officer Chris Woodroofe said the perpetrator had not yet been found.

Flights were halted at 2103 GMT on Wednesday after two drones were spotted near the airfield. The disruption affected at least 120,000 people.

It was not immediately clear what the financial impact would be on the main airlines who operate from Gatwick including easyJet and British Airways.

After a boom in drone sales, unmanned aerial vehicles have become a growing menace at airports across the world.

In Britain, the number of near misses between private drones and aircraft more than tripled between 2015 and 2017, with 92 incidents recorded last year.

Flying drones within 1 km (0.6 mile) of a British airport boundary is punishable by five years in prison.

The drone sightings caused misery for tens of thousands of travellers who were stranded at Gatwick, many sleeping on the floor as they searched for alternative routes to holidays and Christmas family gatherings.

""There's no evidence that it is terror-related in the conventional sense,"" Grayling said. ""But it's clearly a kind of disruptive activity that we've not seen before. This kind of incident is unprecedented anywhere in the world.""

He said it was uncertain how many drones were involved but it appeared to be more than one.

""It's thought to be a small number of drones in the plural,"" Grayling said. ""It certainly wasn't a lot, it was the same small number of drones seen many times.""

Indian-American arrested in Silicon Valley over visa fraud - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: A 46-year-old Indian-American has been arrested and charged in California on charges of H-1B visa fraud.

Kishore Kumar Kavuru was arrested Friday morning and produced before the US Magistrate Judge Susan van Keulen. He was later released on bond.

Kavuru has been charged with 10 counts of visa fraud and as many counts of mail fraud in connection with a scheme to maintain a pool of foreign workers for the clients of his consulting companies.

The accused faces 10 years in prison and a maximum fine of USD 250,000 for each count of visa fraud and up to 20 years of imprisonment for each count of mail fraud.

Since 2007, Kavuru was the owner and chief executive officer of four consulting companies. He is accused of submitting fraudulent documents to both the Department of Labor and the Department of Homeland Security, containing details of bogus work projects awaiting the foreign workers.

Because many of the applications were ultimately approved, the Indian-American had a pool of unemployed H-1B beneficiaries that were immediately available for legitimate work projects, giving him a competitive advantage over other staffing companies that followed the sometimes-lengthy visa-application process, federal prosecutors said.

As part of the scheme, Kavuru required some prospective workers to pay thousands of dollars in cash before he would prepare and submit the visa applications. He also required some workers to wait unpaid, sometimes for months, to be placed at an end-client's workplace, the Department of Justice said in a statement.

Through his consulting companies, Kavuru submitted and mailed approximately 43 petitions for H-1B software engineers. ""In fact, there were no software engineer positions available at the benefits company,"" federal prosecutors added.

Delhi HC grants AJL two-week time to vacate Herald House 

","
NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court on Friday dismissed the petition filed by Associated Journals Ltd(AJL), publisher of National Herald, challenging the eviction order of October 30. The court has given two weeks time to AJL to vacate the premises at ITO. 


The Centre in its eviction order had mentioned a violation of 56-year-old lease conditions by the publisher. 

Justice Sunil Gaur, who was hearing the matter, had reserved his decision on November 22 on AJL's plea against the government's October 30 notice.

The court on the last date had asked the Centre what was the justification to re-enter the premises now when publication of National Herald has commenced.

The Centre and the Land and Development Office (L&DO) had told the court that re-entry notice was issued as it had initiated the proceedings back in 2016 when no printing or publishing activity was going on.

All the procedures have been followed to the hilt before issuing the notice for re-entry to AJL, it had said.

AJL had opposed the Centre's stand, saying that publication of web editions began in 2016 and the issue of absence of printing press in the premises was not raised then.

It had said the government kept silent till April 2018 when it again sent a notice for inspection and in which it had said that it was coming to check breaches mentioned in notice of October 10, 2016.

Death of cow given more significance than that of the police officer, says Naseeruddin Shah; gets trolled 

","
In an apparent reference to the recent mob violence in Uttar Pradesh, actor Naseeruddin Shah said death of a cow is being given more importance than killing of a policeman and was soon trolled for his remark. The actor said the ""poison has already spread"" and it will be now difficult to contain it. 



Quick Edit: Naseeruddin Shah speaks out on India’s culture of impunity



""It will be very difficult to capture this djinn back into the bottle again. There is complete impunity for those who take law into their own hands. In many areas we are witnessing that the death of a cow is more significance than that of a police officer,"" he said. 

A user commented on the YouTube video shared saying,""I think Gulfam Hasan's character played by him in 'Sarfarosh' is actually his real character. Anti-Indian elements are using social media very shrewdly."" 

The comment was in reference to his character in the 1998 action-drama, in which he played a Pakistani singer who aids cross-border terrorism in the garb of spreading music. 

""This is the same guy who signed mercy petition of Yakub Memon. Problem is within you Mr Gulfam Hassan #Nasiruddinshah,"" another user wrote on Twitter. 

""Criminals and corrupt have to fear in India. Go to Pakistan #NaseeruddinShah,"" another user commented. 

Shah also expressed anxiety over the well-being of his children Imaad and Vivaan with actor Ratna Pathak Shah, saying they have not brought up their sons as followers of any particular religion. 

""I feel anxious for my children because tomorrow if a mob surrounds them and asks, 'Are you a Hindu or a Muslim?' they will have no answer. It worries me that I don't see the situation improving anytime soon. 

""These matters don't scare me, they make me angry. And I feel every right-thinking man should feel angry, not scared. This is our home, who dare evict us from here?"" he said in the interview. 

A user said if that is the case, ""why doesn't he get out of here?"" 

The actor was also trolled recently for his comment on cricketer Virat Kohli where he called the Indian skipper ""world's worst behaved player."" 

Interestingly, the actor posted an update on Facebook, hours after his criticism of Kohli, writing, ""Patriotism is often the cry extolled when morally questionable acts are advocated by those in power. - Chelsea Manning, activist."" 










Shah, in his Facebook criticism against Kohli, had also written that he has ""no intention of leaving the country.""

India vs New Zealand: Mithali Raj, Harmanpreet Kaur remain ODI and T20I captains 

","
NEW DELHI: Mithali Raj and Harmanpreet Kaur were on Friday retained as captains for the Indian women's ODI and T20 team respectively while out-of-form Veda Krishnamurthy was dropped from both the squads picked for the New Zealand tour beginning next month.


India will play three ODIs in New Zealand beginning January 24 as part of the ICC Women's Championship before playing three T20 Internationals.

The New Zealand tour will be the team's first assignment after its controversial exit from the World T20 last month when it lost to England in the semi-finals. The 15-member squad for ODIs and T20s was announced a day after WV Raman was appointed as the head coach.

Gary Kirsten was ahead of Raman in the pecking order but the former India men's coach was not ready to give up on his role with Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL. The BCCI had invited fresh applications after Ramesh Powar's term ended on November 30, following the World T20 loss in which he and Harmanpreet had collectively decided to drop senior player Mithali for the all-important semifinal, triggering a massive controversy.

The women's team stood divided with Harmanpreet and her T20 deputy Smriti Mandhana backing Powar for an extension while Mithali was against such a move. However, both Harmanpreet and Mithali had agreed on sorting out their differences going forward.

While Mithali turned up for the selection committee meeting here on Friday, Harmanpreet, who is playing the Women's Big Bash in Australia, joined via Skype. Selection panel chief Hemlata Kala announced the squads in the presence of BCCI CEO Rahul Johri and acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary.

Veda was dropped from both the teams following her lean run, Hemlata told PTI. Mona Meshram replaced Veda in the ODI squad while two changes were made in the squad that went to the West Indies for the World T20.

Shikha Pandey replaced injured pacer Pooja Vastrakar in the T20 squad while uncapped Priya Punia was picked in place of Veda.


ODI Squad: Mithali Raj (captain), Poonam Raut, Smriti Mandhana, Jemimah Rodrigues, Harmanpreet Kaur, Deepti Sharma, Tanya Bhatia (wk), Mona Meshram, Ekta Bist, Mansi Joshi, Dayalan Hemlatha, Poonam Yadav, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Jhulan Goswami, Shikha Pandey.


T20 Squad: Harmanpreet Kaur (captain), Smriti Mandhana (vc), Mithali Raj, Deepti Sharma, Jemimah Rodrigues, Anuja Patil, Dayalan Hemlatha, Mansi Joshi, Shikha Pandey, Tanya Bhatia (wk), Poonam Yadav, Ekta Bist, Radha Yadav, Arundhati Reddy, Priya Punia.

Education has been used to maintain power equation in society: Actress Ratna Pathak Shah - Times of India

","
MUMBAI: Veteran actress Ratna Pathak Shah, who plays a school principal in the upcoming Netflix original ""Selection Day"", has looked at the education system critically and says it has been used to maintain the power equation in society.


""Education is a very potent force that gives you power. In our country, for centuries we believed that education should be kept for the personal purview of a few. The 'shastra' attitude, where we have treated education as a sign of power, knowledge as a sign of power that we all want to hold on to…and that is how the caste system in our country has survived for ages. Education has been used to maintain the power equation in society,"" Ratna told IANS in an interview here.

""We have someone to clean our lavatory, otherwise we have to do it by ourselves. So we have controlled and kept a group of people away from education... but this is practiced in many countries. We are not the first ones, and we won't be the last either.""

The acclaimed theatre and film veteran said it is important to raise questions on the value of education.

""Is the system actually providing education to make a good human being out of a child, or preparing them to become just an employee? In the show, (my character) Neli Weinberg is questioning that.""

The story of ""Selection Day"" revolves around two young boys who are forced to become cricketers to fulfill the dream of their father, who is obsessed with the game.

Ratna's character runs a school that is trying to balance children to dream and not get forced to get into a system.

""A lot of young talent of our country, who do not get a chance to grow up like normal human beings, think about Sachin Tendulkar, who had to grow up faster when he played international cricket as young as 17 years old. This school of Neli is trying to make these two budding crickets grounded for their holistic development,"" she said.

The mother of two sons - Vivaan Shah and Imaad Shah - said parents being less involved in the upbringing of children is also a negative thing.

The ""Sarabhai vs Sarabhai"" fame actress said: ""Due to the commercialisation of education, parents (have) washed their hands off from children, they send them to school and for various courses for them to become someone. Kids are losing their individuality that way. Parents also believe that children are living in a state of idiocy and they should be told how to live life.""

Produced by Anil Kapoor, ""Selection Day"" also features Rajesh Tailang, Mahesh Manjrekar and Shiv Pandit. It will stream on Netflix on December 28.

Organ donation: In her death, Indore woman gives new lease of life to six 

","
INDORE: Emerging as the centre of organ donation, Indore on Wednesday witnessed 36th green corridor. It was for the first time in the state when the donor’s lungs were transplanted. 

Family members of Harshita Kaushal, 36, who died due to brain haemorrhage, agreed for organ donation to fulfil her wish and gave new lease of life to six people. 

Doctors were able to transplant her five organs including eyes, liver, heart, kidneys and lungs. Lungs and heart were sent to Mumbai through air taxi.

Among the beneficiaries, a 27-year-old woman got heart and lungs in Mumbai, a 57-year-old man suffering from NASH got liver in CHL, a 30-year-old man received kidney in Choithram and the other kidney has been donated to 66-year-old woman in Bombay Hospital. Eyes have been donated to MK International Eye Hospital, said NGO Indore Organ Donation Society member Jitu Bagani.

Harshita suffered brain haemorrhage while she was taking her elder brother to hospital. “On Sunday night, I suffered chest pain. Thinking it to be a cardiac arrest, I called Harshita to take me to hospital. She called ambulance. She asked me about my condition, when I told her that I am fine, she collapsed on the floor,” Harshita’s elder brother Abhishek told to TOI.

He added, “We rushed her to Bombay Hospital where doctors informed us about brain haemorrhage. They were going to operate her, but on Tuesday afternoon, they declared her brain dead and then confirmed again on evening.”

Harshita wanted to donate her organs. “My father died around 10 years ago due to kidney failure. At that time, organ donation was rare, due to unavailability of kidney he died. While reading newsprints on organ donation, she used to say that she also want her organs to be donated,” said Anuj, brother of Harshita.

Three green corridors including one till the airport, CHL and Choithram were formed. The first green corridor was formed from Bombay Hospital to airport which started at 3:48pm and ambulance reached airport by 4:05pm. For CHL the ambulance left at 4:10 pm, and reached around 4:15 pm. While for Choithram hospital, the ambulance left Bombay Hospital at 5:29 pm and reached at 5:42 pm.

Sonu Nigam on Sona Mohapatra: She's vomiting on Twitter, but I'd like to maintain decorum 

","
Singer Sonu Nigam has responded to Sona Mohapatra's tweets against him, saying that though she is ""vomiting"" on Twitter, he would like to maintain decorum.



#MeToo movement: Sona Mohapatra hits out at Sonu Nigam for supporting Anu MalikSonu Nigam recently lent his support to singer-composer Anu Malik who is allegedly accused of sexual misconduct. Following this, singer Sona Mohapatra has lashed out against Nigam in her recent Twitter post. 


Mohapatra had voiced her disapproval with Nigam for his reported comment in support of Anu Malik, who is facing #MeToo allegations. She had earlier called the music composer a ""serial predator"".


Nigam was quoted as saying at a media summit over the weekend that Malik, his longtime friend, was accused without any proof and had maintained a dignified silence on the #MeToo allegations



In a statement on Thursday, the singer said, ""The respectable lady vomiting on Twitter, is the wife of someone who I consider very close to me, so although she's has forgotten the relationship, I'd like to maintain the decorum."" 

Nigam said women with courage shaming their oppressors is a ""refreshing"" change.

""Only an animal will not support #MeToo movement. Women with frankness and courage, shaming their oppressors, is a refreshing sign of changing times.

""Women have been long oppressed throughout the course of history and it's high time to end this Tribal mindset of treating them like properties or trophies, and now they walk hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder with men,"" he added.

Malik has repeatedly denied all the allegations. His lawyer told at the time that the #MeToo movement was being used for his client's ""character assassination"".

Following the allegations, the music composer stepped down as a jury member from a singing show, a singing reality show of which he was part since its inception in 2004.

Mohapatra was quick to hit back at Nigam.

""So, now, my identity has become 'wife'. Not only does your reporter refer to me as that, so does the defender of a serial sexual predator. Big hurray for the boys club & big hurrah to patriarchy, not,"" she wrote while tagging news report on the matter.

India vs Australia: Perth pitch rated 'average': Reports 

","
MELBOURNE: The Perth Stadium pitch, which hosted India's second Test against Australia, has been rated ""average"" by the ICC match referee Ranjan Madugalle.


Australia beat India by 146 runs to square the four-match series 1-1.

According to a report in Cricket Australia website, ""It is understood that match referee Ranjan Madugalle rated the pitch at the new Perth Stadium as 'average', which is the lowest pass mark provided by the ICC when they rate the pitch and outfield of Test grounds.""

""The Perth verdict is presumably related to the uneven bounce that resulted in a couple of nasty blows,"" it stated.

The global body introduced a rating system at the start of the year in its bid to improve the standard of pitches – very good, good, average, below average and poor – when rating Test venues.

""It is understood the Adelaide Oval pitch used in the first Test received a 'very good' rating,"" the website claimed in its report.

Incidentally, Madugalle had rated MCG pitch ""poor"" when Australia and England battled out a draw, while two of the past four Boxing Day Tests have ended in a draw.

Madugalle was in charge for the first two Tests in the ongoing series while Zimbabwe's Andy Pycroft will be match referee at Melbourne and Sydney.

LONDON: Up to 93 per cent of green turtle hatchlings could be female by 2100, as climate change causes ""feminisation"" of the species, according to a study.


The sex of turtle hatchlings is determined by temperature, and at present about 52 per cent of hatching green turtles -- one of seven species of sea turtle — are female.

Researchers at the University of Exeter in the UK and the Marine and Environmental Sciences Centre in Portugal found that in warmer temperatures predicted by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios, 76-93 per cent of hatchlings would be female.

The figures are specific to the study site in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, but researchers say they expect a similar picture globally.

They said the changing gender ratio would initially lead to more females nesting, increasing the population, before a decline ""as incubation temperatures approach lethal levels"".

They also predict rising sea levels will submerge 33-43 per cent of current nesting areas used by green turtles on the beaches where the study was carried out.

""Green turtles are facing trouble in the future due to loss of habitats and increasing temperatures,"" said Rita Patricio from the University of Exeter.

""Our results suggest the nesting population of green turtles the Bijagos Archipelago, Guinea-Bissau, will cope with the effects of climate change until 2100,"" said Patricio.

""Cooler temperatures, both at the end of the nesting season and in shaded areas, will guarantee some hatchlings are male.

""Although rising temperatures will lead to more female hatchlings — and 32-64 per cent more nesting females by 2120 — mortality in eggs will also be higher in these warmer conditions,"" she said.

""As temperatures continue to rise, it may become impossible for unhatched turtles to survive,"" said Rita.

Donald Trump throws Kabul, New Delhi under the bus with Afghan withdrawal move 

","
WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump is ordering an American drawdown in Afghanistan, bringing home some 50 per cent of the 15,000 US troops over the next two months. The move will effectively throw the Afghan government under the bus, and beyond that, endanger Indian presence, investment, and stakes in the country, since it is expected to open the floodgates for the return of Taliban and other Pakistani terrorist proxies. 


Trump’s decision to start withdrawing from Afghanistan, which even some American experts described as a defeat, comes on the heels of a similar 

  departure from Syria he announced abruptly over Twitter
 + on Tuesday. The twin disengagements, which are in keeping with the non-interventionist outlook he often expressed during his Presidential campaign and after, led to the resignation on Thursday of Defense Secretary James Mattis. 




US defence secretary Jim Mattis quits as Trump announces Syria withdrawalUS defence secretary Jim Mattis quit Thursday as President Donald Trump weathered an escalating backlash at home and abroad over his sudden decision to pull all troops from Syria. Trump steadfastly defended the withdrawal of the 2,000-strong force from Syria, vowing that the United States would no longer be the ""policeman of the Middle East"".


Trump falsely tweeted that Mattis was “retiring,” but the General, who was sometimes referred to as the only adult in cabinet who could counsel the mercurial President, sent a resignation letter that laid bare their differences, including the broader issue of treatment of allies and the real threats to the United States.



General Jim Mattis will be retiring, with distinction, at the end of February, after having served my Administratio… https://t.co/PqB9L51hvN— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1545344467000

“My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues,” Mattis wrote. “We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances,” he added, clearly implying Trump was not doing it. 

“Because you have the right to a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position,” the departing Defense Secretary, who met his Indian counterpart Nirmala Sitharaman four times this year for talks, said. 

The US President remained unconcerned even as the foreign policy and strategic establishments had a meltdown in the hours after announcement, as he battled to secure funding for a border wall from the Congress in the face of a looming government shutdown, engendering jokes that the greatest military in the world was good for only tackling refugees and asylum-seekers. 

“Getting out of Syria was no surprise. I’ve been campaigning on it for years, and six months ago, when I very publicly wanted to do it, I agreed to stay longer. Russia, Iran, Syria & other are the local enemy of ISIS. We were doing [their] work. Time to come home & rebuild,” he explained over Twitter, as he was excoriated by even Republican lawmakers and many conservative talking heads, save a few isolationists. 

Trump did not refer to the Afghanistan drawndown, but he asked, “Does the USA want to be the Policeman of the Middle East, getting NOTHING but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who, in almost all cases, do not appreciate what we are doing? Do we want to be there forever?”



Does the USA want to be the Policeman of the Middle East, getting NOTHING but spending precious lives and trillions… https://t.co/fNDrsdz1RJ— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1545307014000

The US involvement in Afghanistan has lasted 17 years and Trump has often expressed doubts about the utility of American troops there, evidently untutored over the 1990s vacuum that led to the rise of the Al Qaida and the 9/11 catastrophe, which has been the basis for the interventionist argument espoused by the likes of Mattis and other top US Generals, as also many leading US Senators, including Republicans. 

“The conditions in Afghanistan – at the present moment – make American troop withdrawals a high risk strategy. If we continue on our present course we are setting in motion the loss of all our gains and paving the way toward a second 9/11,” warned Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a key Trump ally on the domestic front.

The Afghan drawdown became imminent the moment Trump announced the Syria withdrawal with many analysts turning their attention to the fertile ground that gave rise to Al Qaeda and 9/11 much before ISIS appeared on the scene.

“How do you think the US precipitous withdrawal in Syria is viewed by the Taliban? The Taliban must smell blood in the water. Why would it compromise when it sees the US so eager to leave? Since when is negotiating from a position of weakness (the US) considered a clever tactic?” asked Bill Roggio of the Long War Journal, referring to recent US efforts to negotiate with the Taliban often without keeping Kabul in the loop.

Others recorded yet another episode of American inconsistency and unreliability. “If stories about US drawdown from #Afghanistan are true, Pres Trump will have done exactly what Pres Obama did: Send troops in, only to withdraw them prematurely, thereby proving the #Taliban’s maxim: Americans have watches, we have time,” Husain Haqqani, Pakistan’s former ambassador to the US, noted sagely.

Sajjan Kumar: Delhi HC dismisses Sajjan Kumar's plea for extension of time to surrender 

","
NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Friday dismissed Sajjan Kumar's plea seeking an extension of time to surrender in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case, saying it found no ground for granting the relief.


The former Congress leader had on December 20 ( Thursday) 

  sought time from the court till January 30
 + to surrender after being recently sentenced to life imprisonment, saying he had to settle family affairs, including those related to property. The convicted ex-member of parliament is married and has three children and eight grandchildren.

The high court had earlier this week directed the 73-year-old to surrender before authorities by December 31 after holding him guilty.




Sajjan Kumar convicted in 1984 anti-Sikh riots case: What the Delhi HC said in its verdictThe Delhi high court on Monday sentenced Congress leader Sajjan Kumar to life in the first conviction of a politician in the deadly anti-Sikh riots in 1984, holding it was perpetrated by those with ""political patronage"" and pushed for a new law for speedy prosecution of genocide and mass killings.


""The applicant is at present under shock and surprise in view of the order of acquittal being set aside and him being convicted, although the applicant believes he in innocent,"" the plea stated.

In his plea, Kumar also said he wants to approach the Supreme Court through a senior lawyer, but as the apex court is on vacation, most senior advocates are on holiday.

“The applicant is the best person to brief his counsel and inform them about the facts. The applicant prays that he be granted further extension of 30 days so as to enable him to settle his family affairs to meet his close relatives, near and dear ones including friends who have been associated with him over a period of 73 years,” it said.

The Delhi high court convicted and awarded life term “till the remainder of his life” to Kumar in a case relating to the killing of five Sikhs in Raj Nagar part-I in Palam Colony in southwest Delhi on November 1-2, 1984, and burning down of a gurdwara in Raj Nagar part II during that period.

The riots had broken out after the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984 by her two Sikh bodyguards.

Donald joins list of worst passwords - Times of India

","
Have we learned nothing from the numerous hacks and leaks in recent memory? Apparently not.

In a world where every service requires one to have a password, it’s hard not to be lazy. We assume that the chance that someone is looking to hack the most inconsequential of accounts must be slim.

Password management company Splash Data released its annual list of the 100 worst passwords of the year based on 5 million leaked passwords on the internet. The eighth iteration of the list, it seems that despite the many data breaches in the recent past, we have still not learnt our lesson. The top worst passwords continue to be ‘123456’ and ‘password’ for the fifth year in a row.

Some of you have switched things up, as there are several new entries to this year’s list, like ‘donald’ ranked at number 23, presumably inspired by President Donald Trump.

If you have committed the grave error of opting for one of the easy passwords on the list, don’t worry because you’re in esteemed company. The Pentagon didn’t change the password to their weapon’s system from the default password. According to an audit by the Government Accountability Office, officers were able to guess admin passwords in just nine seconds.

Rapper Kanye West is also guilty of taking the easy way out when it comes to passwords. During a meeting with US president Donald Trump in October, West took out his iPhone and unlocked it using the not-soclever code ‘000000’, paying no heed to the many cameras witnessing the affair.

Splash Data has also offered solutions for those who have passwords featured on the list. They recommend using passphrases of twelve characters or more with a mixed types of characters. Having unique passwords for each account was also recommended. That way, even if a hacker accesses one of your accounts, they will not be able to use it to access other sites.

How do you keep track of all these unique passwords? Splash Data suggests using a password manager. This allows you to protect your identity by organizing your many passwords, generating secure random passwords and lets you log into websites automatically.

Infographic: The internet lacks language diversity - Times of India

","
Ten languages account for nearly 90 per cent of the top 10 million websites -- a tiny fraction of the world’s 7,097 languages.

For native English speakers – around 5% of the global population – there isn’t much difference between real life and online life, since more than half of the web is in their language. But those who cannot speak or understand English, much of the internet is out of reach. 

Clearly, the absence of so many languages creates a so-called digital divide, that may restrict access to data and information. So while in one sense, the internet opens the door for anyone to create content in any language, many languages are just not present in the online space.

Former South African President Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.” The internet needs to a cue from this.

Rupee rallies 69 paise, settles below 70-mark - Times of India

","
MUMBAI: The rupee strengthened further by 69 paise to close at 69.70 against the US dollar Thursday as the Fed raised the interest rate but lowered its projection for future hikes.


Tumbling crude oil prices and sustained selling of the greenback by exporters and banks gave further impetus to the local unit, forex dealers said.

This is the fourth straight session of gains for the rupee, during which it has rallied by a hefty 220 paise.

At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (forex) market, the local unit opened lower at 70.63. It touched a high of 69.65 on robust dollar selling, before finally finishing at 69.70, up 69 paise from its previous close.

The US Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate for the fourth time this year, and signalled more next year, albeit at a slower pace than expected. The quarter-point increase, to 2.25-2.5 per cent, lifted the Fed's key rate to its highest point since 2008.

""Fed slashed the interest rate hike trajectory for CY19 to two from four in 2018, which is positive for emerging market to attract liquidity,"" said Vinod Nair, head of research, Geojit Financial Services Ltd.

Globally, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, was trading at USD 55.45 per barrel, down 3.13 per cent.

The Financial Benchmark India Private Ltd (FBIL) set the reference rate for the rupee/dollar at 70.2835 and for rupee/euro at 80.0548. The reference rate for rupee/British pound was fixed at 88.8454 and for rupee/100 Japanese yen at 62.79.

Virat Kohli: We wanted Anil Kumble to continue but he wanted to quit after his fallout with skipper Virat Kohli: Laxman 

","
VISAKHAPATNAM: BCCI's Cricket Advisory Committee member and batting legend VVS Laxman Friday said the their panel wanted Anil Kumble to continue as India's coach but the former captain was bent on quitting after his fallout with skipper Virat Kohli last year.


Reflecting on the tumultuous phase that gripped Indian cricket during last year's Champions Trophy, Laxman said the episode left a ""bitter taste in the mouth"".

""I don't think Kohli crossed the line. We at the CAC thought Anil should continue as coach but he thought the right decision was to quit and move ahead. It left a bitter taste in the mouth,"" Laxman said at the 'India Today South Conclave'.

The CAC, comprising Laxman, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly, picked Kumble as national coach in 2016.

However, the appointment didn't quite work out as Kumble and Kohli's difference of opinions spiralled into a full-blown public fallout which culminated into Kumble stepping down.

The former captain went on to say that his relationship with Kohli had become untenable.

""What I did not like was the way he was getting bad press during the Champions Trophy. The CAC wanted Anil to continue and the entire episode was very unfortunate, Laxman said.

""I always tell people CAC are not marriage counsellors. We were tasked with selecting the best possible job. We did a very elaborate process - unfortunately, Virat Kohli and Anil Kumble did not work out,"" he added.

LJP to contest on 6 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar; announcement on Saturday 

","
NEW DELHI: After some hard bargaining by the Lok Janshakti Party, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar is understood to have sealed a seat-sharing deal for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls with the BJP and the Janata Dal-United contesting an equal number of 17 seats each leaving the rest of the six seats to the party headed by Ram Vilas Paswan.


In a bid to retain the LJP in its fold, the BJP is also believed to have agreed to give a Rajya Sabha seat from its quota to the party.

The seat-sharing arrangement is likely to be made public on Saturday in the presence of BJP chief Amit Shah, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and LJP supremo Ram Vilas Paswan. 

The LJP national spokesperson Sanjay Saraf told IANS, ""It has been decided that our party would contest six Lok Sabha seats in Bihar and get one Rajya Sabha berth."" 

Earlier in the day, Union Minister Arun Jaitley held discussions with Ramvilas Paswan and his son Chirag Paswan over seat sharing arrangements in Bihar for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

The discussion came a day after LJP leaders met BJP President Amit Shah and shared their concerns over the delay in holding talks over the seat sharing issue.

After the meeting with Jaitley, LJP Parliamentary Board Chairman Chirag Paswan expressed the hope that talks would move in the right direction.

""Talks are going on. An announcement will be made at an appropriate time. We have put our points before the BJP leadership and the important thing is that we are being heard. Hope everything will be fine,"" he told reporters.

His uncle, Ram Chandra Paswan, who also attended the meeting said that the LJP would remain part of the NDA.

""We are and will remain in the NDA. Seat sharing will be announced this week,"" Ram Chandra Paswan said. 

""The party, which is having strongholds in any specific area, should be respected. We are a small party. We need adequate time for preparation. That's why we wanted the issue to be resolved at the earliest,"" he told reporters.

Sources in the BJP said a final arrangement of seats would be formalised after a meeting of the BJP and LJP leaders with Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who is in Delhi.

A Bharatiya Janata Party leader also claimed that talks were going in the right direction and everything will be finalised soon.

In the last Lok Sabha polls, the BJP had contested from 30 seats and won 22, while the LJP won six seats and lost one. The Rashtriya Lok Samta Party (RLSP), which is now a part of the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan (Grand Alliance) in Bihar, bagged three. 

In 2014, the Janata Dal-United (JD-U) had contested on its own but performed poorly. It had won only two seats.

On Thursday, BJP leader and Bihar in-charge Bhupendra Yadav first went to meet Chirag and Ram Vilas Paswan and the three leaders later went to the residence of Amit Shah. They were joined there by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.

The BJP and the Nitish Kumar-led JD-U had declared earlier that they would contest an equal number of seats in Bihar in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

Life term: Tandoor murder case: Delhi HC orders release of Sushil Sharma 

","
NEW DELHI: Observing that even convicted prisoners have fundamental rights, the Delhi high court on Friday released former Youth Congress leader Sushil Kumar Sharma, who killed his wife Naina Sahni in 1995 and tried to dispose of her body by burning it in a tandoor.


A bench of justices Siddharth Mridul and Sangita Dhingra Sehgal set aside the order of Lt Governor and the Sentence Review Board of Delhi govt refusing to release Sharma on remission.

He has spent continuous 23 and half years in jail since the murder and the court noted that Delhi Police failed to show a single cogent reason why he shouldn't be reformed and allowed to integrate back with society.

HC also took into account his good conduct in jail and a thumbs up from govt's social welfare department and his chief probation officer - all of whom had recommended his premature release from jail.

The court noted that Sharma's aged and infirm parents need him in their twilight years and he can be rehabilitated.

As per prosecution, the convict had shot his wife Naina with his licensed revolver on the night of July 2, 1995, taken her body to a restaurant, chopped it into pieces and tried to burn them in the restaurant's oven, leading the case to be popularly called 'tandoor murder case'.

The Supreme Court had commuted to life imprisonment the death penalty awarded to Sharma by a trial court in 2003 and upheld by the high court in 2007, saying the murder was the outcome of ""strained personal relationship"" and the convict was ""not a confirmed criminal"".

While reducing the sentence awarded to him, the apex court had said that ""life sentence is for the whole of remaining life of Sharma subject to remission granted by the appropriate government under the Code of Criminal Procedure.

BJP rath yatra Bengal: Calcutta high court puts BJP's rath yatra in West Bengal on hold for now 

","
KOLKATA: A division bench of the Calcutta high court on Friday quashed a single bench order that had allowed BJP's 'Rath Yatra' in West Bengal and asked it to hear the case afresh to consider intelligence inputs by state agencies.


The single-judge bench of Tapabrata Chakraborty was asked to dispose the matter expeditiously after considering whether there were adequate materials to arrive at the conclusion to allow the 'yatra' as proposed by the BJP.

The division bench said the order needs to consider afresh with the 36 intelligence inputs submitted by the state government before the single bench.

Advocate General Kishore Dutta, representing the state, said that the single bench had not considered the intelligence inputs submitted to it in a sealed cover and had returned it to him without even opening it.

He had submitted intelligence inputs from 31 police districts and five police commisionerates before the bench, which he said talked about apprehension of communal unrest if the BJP's proposed roadshows were allowed.

The 'Rath Yatra', which was originally scheduled to start on December 7 but was denied permission by the state government, has become the latest political flashpoint between the saffron party and the state's ruling Trinamool Congress.

After hearing an appeal by the BJP, a single-judge bench of the high court had on Thursday allowed the mega event, to be flagged off by BJP president Amit Shah under a re-scheduled programme from December 28 to 31.

The West Bengal government, however, challenged the ruling before a division bench of Chief Justice Debasish Kargupta and Justice Shampa Sarkar, which has now quashed the earlier ruling and sent the case back to the single-judge bench.

In its appeal, the government expressed urgency and sought immediate hearing of the matter.

Setting aside the denial of permission by the state government, the single-judge bench had allowed the 'yatra' while noting that courts can interfere if administrative authorities exercise their discretionary powers in a whimsical manner.

Following the court order, the BJP had come up with tentative new dates for its proposed three-phase programme.

After the new order, there is uncertainty once again over the mega event that was to cover all 42 Lok Sabha constituencies in the state ahead of the 2019 general elections.

Earlier on December 6, the same single-judge bench had refused permission to the BJP to hold the 'Rath Yatra', which was scheduled to be flagged off by Shah from Cooch Behar on December 7. The party had then approached the division bench.

The division bench had then asked the state chief secretary, the home secretary and the director general of police to hold a meeting with representatives of the BJP and take a decision on the 'yatra' by December 14.

After parleys with the BJP team, the three officers refused permission for the rallies on December 15 on grounds that they might lead to communal tensions.

Following this, the state BJP had moved the court of Justice Chakraborty again challenging the government's denial of permission and had got a go-ahead on Thursday.

DU planning online entrance exams - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: The Delhi University is planning to introduce online entrance exams from next session onwards, officials said here.


They said the modalities would be worked out after the admissions committee is constituted.

""Currently, suggestions are being sought on the members to be appointed to the Admissions Committee. The admissions committee is likely to be formed in the next two weeks,"" said an official.

The previous Admissions Committee of the varsity had met in January this year and it was decided that the varsity would have online entrance examinations to ensure that students who have not secured high percentage also stand a chance to study in Delhi University.

It was decided that a pilot project would be started for the 2018-2020 session for two-three courses, but it was not done and the admissions to courses happened on the basis of cut-offs.

""The proposal to have online entrance examinations was made by the Department of Commerce. Some members said the online mode would be difficult for students from far-flung areas who are not well-versed with computers,"" said an official.

The official said it was decided that there would be an offline as well as an online entrance exam to the varsity.

It was decided that candidates meeting the minimum eligibility criteria would have to go through a screening test and those who score more than 50 per cent would be shortlisted.

""This was done because there are many education boards across India and each board has different difficult levels and different marking system. The entrance test was thought as a way to ensure that all students can be on par and get a shot at getting through the DU,"" he said.

The Delhi University is also mulling whether the entrance exam can be outsourced to the National Testing Agency.

""It is yet to be decided whether it can be done. The varsity will bring out a notification and subsequently the process will begin after the admissions committee members are finalised,"" he added.

Some faculty members have expressed reservations about the plan saying it will lead to increase in cost of conducting exams and will also put students who are not well-versed with computers at a disadvantage.

A former member of the Admission Committee of the varsity said the time is quite less for working out the modules of online entrance examinations.

""The office of the Dean, Students' Welfare has got new members this year in place of members who had been there for close to 10 years. They should at least be given time to understand the process of admission for a year,"" he added.

However, some faculty members have supported the move saying it will help those students who do not meet the cut-offs to realise their dream of studying in the varsity.

Currently, the varsity holds entrance examinations for nine undergraduate professional courses and for postgraduate courses.

A teachers' group Academics For Action and Development (AAD) condemned the decision of the varsity to hold entrance exams and called it part of the larger design of ""privatisation"".

""It is a conspiracy to deprive students from the SC/ST/OBC, rural and underprivileged segments of society who are not in a position for various reasons to perform well at these examinations. Multiplicity of entrance exams will increase stress levels of students, who are already overburdened,"" said AAD's chairman Aditya Narayan Mishra.

He also said there was no discussion about holding the entrance tests in statutory bodies like the Academic and Executive Councils.

The Jawaharlal Nehru University will be holding online entrance exams in May 2019, a move criticised by the students' union which called it a ""scam"". The JNU students union has alleged that the varsity will have to spend more for the exam at a time when it is having shortage of funds.

Rare albino orangutan released back into the wild - Times of India

","
JAKARTA: The world's only known albino orangutan has been released back into the jungle more than a year after she was found emaciated and bloody in a remote corner of Borneo, an Indonesian NGO said Friday.


Environmentalists rescued ""Alba"" from a cage where she was being kept as a pet by villagers in Central Kalimantan in April last year.

She was found with dry blood smeared around her nose -- the result of her violent capture -- and weighed just 8 kilogrammes, the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation (BOSF) said.

The blue-eyed primate, covered in fuzzy white hair, was on Wednesday returned to the wild with her best friend, Kika, after leaving their rehabilitation centre.

""So far she's showing good signs of adapting,"" Nico Hermanu, a BOSF spokesman, told AFP.

""She's been climbing trees as high as 35 metres (about 115 feet) and has been eating fruit from the forest.""

Kika and Alba -- who is six years old and now 28 kilos -- will be monitored by conservation teams at Bukit Baka Bukit Raya National Park.

The rescue is a rare spot of bright news for the critically endangered species, which has seen its habitat shrink drastically over the past few decades largely due to the destruction of forests for logging, paper, palm oil and mining.

The population of orangutans in Borneo has plummeted from about 288,500 in 1973 to about 100,000 today, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

A string of fatal attacks on the great apes this year have been blamed on farmers and hunters.

Four Indonesian men were arrested over the killing of an orangutan shot some 130 times with an 
airrifle in February.

Borneo police have also arrested two rubber plantation workers and accused them of shooting an orangutan multiple times before decapitating it.

Plantation workers and villagers are sometimes known to attack the animal because they see it as a pest, while poachers also capture them to sell as pets.

I was born in the same state as you in India: Congresswoman Jayapal tells Google CEO - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: For Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, it was an occasion to celebrate as Indian American Sunder Pichai, the Google CEO, appeared before a Congressional committee for a grilling by lawmakers on the search engine's data privacy.


The two, now holding reputable positions in different spheres of lives -- one in politics and the other in the corporate world -- were born in the same Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Jayapal, the first ever Indian American Congresswoman made this point during the Congressional hearing.

""Let me just take a point of personal privilege to say that I was born in the same state as you in India and I am excited to see you leading a company and continuing to show that immigrants to this country contribute great value, in spite of some of the rhetoric we hear. Thank you Mr Pichai,"" she told the Google CEO.

Pichai, 46, was born in Chennai. A graduate from the IIT Kharagpur, he joined Google in 2004 and in 2015, was appointed the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the company.

Jayapal, 53, too was born in Chennai and came to the US as a student. Both passed through a similar immigration pathway, involving H-1B visa and Green Card, before becoming US citizens.

During the hearing, Jayapal asked questions to Pichai on sexual harassment and hate speech.

""Do you agree with the UN high commissioner for human rights assessment that social media played a role, for example, in perpetuating genocide against the Rohingya and what is Google's response ability to moderate hate speech on your platforms?,"" she asked.

""We feel a tremendous sense of responsibility to moderate hate speech. You know, we have defined hate speech clearly as inciting violence or hatred towards groups of people,"" Pichai said.

""It is absolutely something which I think we need to take a very strict line on and we have stated our policies clearly and we are working hard to make our enforcement better and we have gotten a lot better. But it is not enough and so, we are committed to doing more here,"" he added.

In her remarks, Jayapal expressed her deep concerns about employers mandating forced arbitration rather than allowing for people to pursue justice.

""Forcing people into arbitration when they have already experienced a violation of their basic rights I think is a deep injustice and it subjects people who have already been victimised to further victimisation and we have seen research that shows that it discourages people from coming forward to report abuses to begin with,"" she said.

Pichai said Google's arbitration agreements did not require any confidentiality provisions.

""That is how we have done it. But for sexual harassment, we agreed that it should be up to the employees and we give them a choice,"" he said.

""We are definitely looking into this further. It is an area where I have gotten feedback personally from our employees, so we are definitely reviewing what we could do and you know, I am looking forward to consulting and happy to think about more changes here,"" Pichai said.

Following Jayapal's remarks, Congressman Keith Rothfus said both the Indian Americans were success stories of immigrants.

""I just want to echo what my colleague Ms Pramila Jayapal had said. I am glad you are here at the committee but I am glad you are here in our country. You are a success story and I can just think of you sitting as a teenager in India, thinking that this was probably never even on your radar,"" he said.

""But you came to this country, because this country had that promise out there and I want to thank you for being here today and encourage you to continue collaborating with this committee,"" Rothfus said.

Bacterial protein could help find materials for your next smartphone - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: Scientists have discovered a new bacterial protein that could help detect and collect the rare-earth metals from the environment used in making smartphones.


The protein is 100 million times better at binding to lanthanides or the rare-earth metals than to other metals like calcium, said researchers from Pennsylvania State University(Penn State) in the US.

Two studies, which appears in the Journal of the American Chemical Society and the journal Biochemistry, describe the unique structure of the protein, which likely plays a role in its remarkable selectivity for lanthanides.

""Recently, there has been a lot of interest in increasing accessibility of rare-earth elements like lanthanides, which are used in the screens and electronics of smartphones, batteries of hybrid cars, lasers, and other technologies,"" said Joseph Cotruvo, an assistant professor at Penn State.

""Because the physical properties of rare-earth elements are so similar, it can be difficult to target and collect one in particular,"" Cotruvo said.

""Understanding how this protein binds lanthanides with such incredibly high selectivity could reveal ways to detect and target these important metals,"" he said.

The team discovered the protein, which they named lanmodulin, within the bacterium Methylobacterium extorquens, which grows on plant leaves and in soil and plays an important role in how carbon moves through the environment.

The bacteria require lanthanides for the proper function of some of their enzymes, including one that helps the bacteria to process carbon, which is required for its growth.

""These bacteria need lanthanides and other metals like calcium to grow,"" said Cotruvo.

""It appears that these bacteria have developed a unique way to target lanthanides in the environment, where they are much less abundant than other metals like calcium,"" he said.

The protein's unique structure, which Cotruvo determined in collaboration with the lab of Scott Showalter, an associate professor at Penn State, may explain why it is 100 million times better at binding lanthanides over calcium.

In the absence of metal, Cotruvo said, the protein is mostly unstructured, but when metal is present, it changes conformation into a compact, well-defined structure.

The new compact form contains four structures called ""EF hands.""

Human cells contain many proteins with EF hands, which are involved in using calcium for functions like neurons firing and muscles contracting.

These proteins also bind lanthanides, though lanthanides are not physiologically relevant in humans and the proteins are only 10 or 100 times more likely to bind lanthanides than they are to bind calcium.

The compact structure of the lanmodulin protein also contains an amino acid called proline in a unique position in each of the EF hands, which may contribute to the protein's lanthanide selectivity.

""The mechanism of lanmodulin's selectivity for lanthanides is not yet clear, but we think it comes down to the structural change that occurs in the presence of metals,"" said Cotruvo.

Understanding how the protein is so selective may provide insights for the collection of lanthanides for industrial purposes, including extraction from mining waste streams.

Rangaswamy feels women's cricket being used to target me: Diana Edulji says in mail to Vinod Rai 

","
NEW DELHI: India's first women's cricket captain and member of the panel that picked the new coach, Shantha Rangaswamy feels the issue of women's cricket has been used to attack her former teammate Diana Edulji, the dissenting CoA member has said.



READ ALSO: Process of appointing coach a sham: Diana Edulji
The 64-year-old Rangaswamy, who played 16 Tests and 19 ODIs for India, was part of the three-member committee that chose WV Raman as the new women's coach on Thursday.

The entire process was marred by a war of words between Committee of Administrators (COA) chief Vinod Rai and Edulji. While Edulji wanted incumbent Ramesh Powar to continue, Rai advocated the initiation of a fresh process as Powar's interim tenure had ended last month.

Edulji, who was accused of bias by ODI captain Mithali Raj following a bitter fallout with Powar, said Rangaswamy has backed her in an email that was sent to the CoA as well as BCCI secretary Amitabh Choudhary.

""Shantha Rangaswamy has also on an e-mail addressed to us and the acting secretary mentioned that the issue of women's cricket was used to attack the CoA member because of the stand she took against the CEO,"" she alleged.

Edulji said the entire issue of women's cricket has been raised in a manner to divert attention from the alleged sexual harassment case involving BCCI CEO Rahul Johri.

Johri resumed charge last month after two members of the three-strong probe panel ruled the sexual harassment matter in Johri's favour.

While Rai was satisfied with the report submitted by the the probe panel, Edulji remains firm on her stance that Johri should step down.

Two days after Johri was cleared, the Indian women's team lost to England in the semifinals of the World T20 with senior player Mithali Raj dropped for the crucial knockout fixture.

A month later, the CoA is divided more than ever after Raman was appointed as the new coach, replacing Powar.

""...you have used the women's cricket as a diversionary (sic) tactic to take the heat off the CEO's sexual harassment allegations and made a big deal out of a non issue. This is once again a big dent on women's cricket in particular and BCCI at large,"" wrote Edulji to Rai after Raman was appointed in a late-night development on Thursday.

Solar system's most distant object is 'Farout' pink dwarf planet - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: Scientists have discovered the most distant object known in our solar system, so remote and unusual they chose the nickname ""Farout"" for the slow-moving, icy, pinkish dwarf planet about 120 to 130 times further from the sun than Earth.


Astronomer Scott Sheppard of the carnegie institution for science in Washington said on Tuesday the dwarf planet, officially designated as 2018 VG18, is estimated to have a diameter of 310 to 375 miles (500 to 600 km).

There are roughly 50 dwarf planets in the solar system. The biggest are Pluto, with a diameter of about 1,470 miles (2,370 km), and Eris, with a diameter of about 1,445 miles (2,325 km).

""When I saw the object for the first time, it was moving so slowly, it was the slowest thing I had ever seen. So I kind of muttered to myself, 'Far out,"" kind of like, 'That's cool.' But it's also a very-far-out object in distance, so that's why I went with calling it 'Farout,'"" Sheppard said.

Its discovery was announced on Monday by the international astronomical union's minor planet centre.

""We don't know too much about it,"" Sheppard added. ""We only detected it last month. From its brightness, we can determine its size. We know its color. It has a pinkish, reddish hue to it. If you put ices out there and you irradiate them from the solar radiation over time, ices turn kind of a reddish, pinkish color. So we think its surface is probably ice-covered.""

Sheppard and other scientists spotted Farout during their search for extremely distant solar system objects including a potential Planet X that he said could be five to 10 times the size of Earth. In 2014, these researchers proposed the existence of a ninth major planet at the outer reaches of the solar system.

They said Farout is moving so slowly that it might need more than 1,000 years for a single orbit of the sun.

The second-most-distant observed solar system object is Eris, which orbits at about 96 times the distance of the Sun to the Earth. Pluto orbits at about 34 times the distance of Earth from the Sun.

2019 Lok Sabha polls: Ram Vilas Paswan holds talks with Jaitley over seat sharing in Bihar 

","
NEW DELHI: LJP president Ram Vilas Paswan on Friday met BJP leader Arun Jaitley amid indications that the two parties may soon arrive at a seat-sharing agreement in Bihar for the Lok Sabha polls.


Paswan's son Chirag, who has been vocal in airing his party's differences with the BJP, told reporters that talks were on and claimed there were other issues besides sharing of seats.

Another Lok Janshakti Party leader, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that talks have been positive and they were hopeful of an early solution.

""If all goes well, we will contest six of the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar,"" he said.

There is speculation that the regional party has also sought a Rajya Sabha berth.

If the LJP is given six seats, as many as it had won in 2014, then the BJP and its another ally Janata Dal (United), which is headed by Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, will contest 17 seats each.

BJP president Amit Shah had earlier announced that his party and the JD(U) will be contesting equal number of seats in the politically crucial state where the BJP-led NDA had won 31 seats in 2014.

The deployment of Jaitley, an old Bihar hand in the party with friendly relations with leaders of different parties, by the BJP to buy truce with the LJP underscores the importance the saffron party has attached to continuing its alliance with Paswan's party, which enjoys strong influence among Dalits.

Top BJP leaders, including its president Amit Shah and Jaitley, had held an hour-long meeting with LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan and his son Thursday to resolved their differences.

Chirag Paswan had earlier written a letter to Jaitley asking him to explain what benefits demonetisation brought to the country.

He had also tweeted that a delay in seat-sharing announcement may harm the ruling alliance.

The SUV, previously codenamed as S201, is built on the X-100 platform, which has produced SsangYong Tivoli. According to Mahindra's Korean subsidiary SsangYong, the company has sold over 2.6 lakh Tivoli in over 50 countries since its launch in 2015.

Mahindra XUV 300's body characteristics are said to be inspired by a 'Cheetah', a silhoutte that also underpins its elder sibling, the XUV500.

The compact SUV segment currently accounts for about 60 per cent in the over all SUV volumes, M&M managing director Pawan Goenka said, adding, the company looks to corner about 15 per cent market share of the segment with the new vehicle.

""We have given some very advanced and unique features in our XUV300. So, within the compact SUV segment, we are going to position it as the premium product,"" added Goenka.

He said as of now the company does not have a very strong product in the compact SUV segment and XUV300 will fill this gap.

The compact SUV segment has been growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 44 per cent over the last five years while the current market size its stands at around 35-40,000 vehicles per month.

""It is a fast growing market and we want to capture a sizable markets share out of the segment,"" said Rajan Wadhera, President Automotive Sector, M&M Ltd.

The 5-seater XUV300 will be manufactured at M&M's Nashik facility, the company said in an official statement.

Goenka said that the company plans to launch the new vehicle in one two overseas markets as well along with its roll out in the domestic market.

He also said that the company is working on the an electric version of the new compact SUV, which is expected to hit the market in 2020. It will rival the likes of Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza, Tata Nexon and the upcoming Nissan Kicks.

Elon Musk's SpaceX set to raise $500 million: Report - Times of India

","
New YORK: Elon Musk's rocket company SpaceX plans to raise $500 million to help launch its satellite internet service, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday.


SpaceX will garner the funds from existing shareholders and a new investor, Baillie Gifford & Co, a Scottish money management firm that is also a major shareholder in the Musk-led Tesla Motors.

The new funding round lifts SpaceX's valuation to $30.5 billion, the newspaper reported. SpaceX could announce the deal by the end of the year.

SpaceX in November won authorization from US officials for a total of nearly 12,000 satellites into orbit in order to boost cheap, wireless internet access by the 2020s.

Serial entrepreneur Musk has risen to prominence with a series of ambitious ventures, especially Tesla, which has boosted production of its Model 3 electric car and has continued to enjoy strong demand for the vehicle.

Other Musk ventures include OpenAI, Neuralink and the Boring Company. But Musk has also drawn plenty of criticism over unconventional and at times erratic behaviour.

In an interview broadcast earlier this month, Musk openly mocked the US Securities and Exchange Commission after agreeing to a $20 million fine to settle fraud charges the agency had brought over Musk's quickly aborted effort to take Tesla private.

No chaos or snags: Tech helps test pass muster 

","
NEW DELHI: After two unsuccessful attempts and following the incessant push of friends and family, I decided to reappear for the National Eligibility Test, which qualifies one for lectureship in colleges and universities. Even as I was mulling over the decision, the National Testing Agency, holding the exam for the first time after taking over from the University Grants Commission and CBSE, announced that it was opting for the online format this year. 


As a reporter who had covered the protest against the lacunae in the Staff Selection Committee’s online exams earlier this year, I had severe misgivings about whether a government agency could successfully conduct such a mass exam online.



It was with such thoughts that I travelled an hour and half on Tuesday to my allotted centre in outer Delhi. My nerves were on edge, having received a flurry of reminders on email and text messaging about what to carry to the exam hall. I reached the centre to find officials at the main gate guiding the candidates, one of whom glanced at my admit card and informed me what I had to do next. It was a pleasant surprise that the exam centre in outer Delhi had proper monitoring via CCTV cameras on the front entry gate.

I was frisked through to another room, where the official there helped me find the computer lab where I was supposed to sit for the exam. No one had ever helped me in this manner in earlier years — in the NET conducted by UGC and CBSE, I had struggled to find the room where I was to sit and write the test.

There was no queue or a rush of candidates as I quietly walked up for the biometric attendance — I pressed my thumb on the fingerprint reader and had a photograph taken. Then I was allotted a seat by the online system among the rows equipped with CCTV cameras. I realised that the computerised allocation of seating prevented the possibility of foul play.

So far so good. But would the system work fine and allow me to finish my exam without a hassle or would technical glitches mar my effort? I had my answer after three hours, one hour for Paper I and two for Paper II. Neither I nor the 100 others in the room had any complaints about the entire system. The navigation from one question to the other was seamless. We even had the option of putting our answers on review and returning to them for completion later. The experience was at par with the TOEFL I sat for a few years ago.

The quality of questions was another pleasant change. Paper I, focusing on research, was totally oriented towards this objective. Paper II comprised subject-specific questions. As for the questions, it was obvious some quality thought had gone into formulating them. This year, the questions expected you, as someone supposed to have close knowledge of a subject you are going to teach, to know both the intrinsic aspects of that subject as well as its importance in daily life. My subject was mass communication and journalism, so the reasoning and assertion question related to the different practical aspects of the media, unlike in the earlier years when they were more about theory and less to do with everyday journalism. Similarly, the comprehension passage was on press freedom.

In the end, it was a satisfying experience finishing the exam on a computerised system. Besides, as I left the exam hall, I also had the rewarding sense of having avoided the environmental wastage involved in printing a 16-page booklet.

Australian Open to have 10-point tiebreakers in deciding set 

","
MELBOURNE (Australia): The Australian Open in January will play a 10-point tiebreaker in deciding sets, no longer playing advantage in the final sets.

The tournament said Friday that the decision, reported widely a month ago but denied by Australian Open officials, came after consultation with current and former players and tennis officials.

Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley says ""We asked the players - both past and present, commentators, agents and TV analysts - whether they wanted to play an advantage final set or not, and went from there.

""We went with a 10-point tiebreak at six-games-all in the final set to ensure the fans still get a special finale to these often epic contests, with the longer tiebreak still then allowing for that one final twist or change of momentum in the contest. This longer tiebreak also can lessen some of the serving dominance that can prevail in the shorter tiebreak.""

In the men's singles draw, the first four sets will feature a seven-point tiebreaker at 6-6, with the final set going to a 10-point tiebreaker at 6-6. In women's singles play and men's and women's doubles and mixed doubles, the deciding set of three sets will be played with a 10-point tiebreaker if level at 6-6.

Wimbledon announced in October that it will next year have a standard first-to-seven points tiebreaker when the deciding set reaches 12-12.

The U.S. Open was the first Grand Slam tournament to introduce final-set tiebreakers, with a first-to-seven points game played at 6-6.

The French Open is now the only Grand Sam event still decided by a long deciding set by advantage.

The Australian Open begins Jan. 14.

Three Indian-origin students among Time's 25 most influential teens of 2018 - Times of India

","
HOUSTON: Three Indian-origin students have been named among the 25 most influential teens of 2018 by Time magazine for making a mark across numerous fields.



Indian-American Kavya Kopparapu, Rishab Jain, and British-Indian Amika George are among the group who have become inspirations for youngsters across the world due to their spectacular achievements through their work and passion.

Rishabh, an eighth grader, who has developed an algorithm that can possibly be a cure to pancreatic cancer.

Kavya Kopparapu is a freshman at the Harvard University. She developed a deep-learning computer system that can scan slides of tissue from brain cancer patients looking for differences in density, colour, texture and cellular alignment that are unique to that particular person's case.

She developed the system after learning how the survival rate of glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer, has not improved from the past 30 years.

According to Time magazine, her goal is ""to develop targeted therapies that are also unique to the person.""

Amika George's goal is to convince policymakers to end ""period poverty,"" as she calls it, by funding the distribution of menstrual products to girls and women who cannot afford them.

""It really upsets me,"" she tells the magazine of learning that many girls in the UK were routinely missing school during their periods because they could not afford to buy menstrual products.

""The government knew this was happening on their watch, but they were refusing to find a solution,"" she said.

She launched the #FreePeriods campaign as a response, gathering nearly 200,000 signatures on her petition to help eradicate period poverty; the movement eventually garnered the support of over a dozen UK policymakers, galvanising the government to allocate funds to the issue for the first time.

There are not many gay and brown folks in food. But hey, we can cook too: Nik Sharma - Times of India

","
Nik's debut cookbook Seasons: Big Flavors, Beautiful Food, which has won praise from none other than Nigella Lawson, is a nod to his Indian roots and his home in the US, with dishes like chat masala grilled pork chops and apple masala chai cake. Sonam Joshi talks to the award-winning food blogger



You went to the US to study molecular genetics. How did the shift to food happen?
I got my love for cooking from my mom’s family, especially my grandmother. On holidays, each of my grandmother’s kids were tasked with bringing one dish to a family event, and sometimes, everyone got together to make sweets. As a kid, learning how to cook was fun. It is a very experimental process — that’s what drew me. Both my parents were working so I was left to my own devices. I remember putting Rooh Afza into rice thinking it’d be an interesting combination, but it was terrible.
I started cooking for myself when I moved to Cincinnati in 2002. By the time I got a job in Washington DC, I’d eaten different kinds of food. I began taking cooking more seriously and started the blog in 2011. When I moved to California, I decided to work in a kitchen and called up 12-13 pastry shops. Only one called me back. I’d go to work at the pastry shop at 4.30am, and then to my pharmaceutical job. After two weeks, I quit my job.



Did studying science influence your cooking?
Science helps me to be a better cook. Even the way we write recipes or an experiment are almost identical, listing ingredients and steps to be taken in a logical flow. I find myself paying attention to things like textures, taste and aromas and I observe how food changes as it cooks or comes into contact with other ingredients. 



Your mom is Goan, while your dad is north Indian. How did this early exposure to two vastly different food traditions help?
My dad is from Mathura, so his cuisine was more vegetarian. I learnt the use of dairy, ingredients like heeng and that there is a sense to the way spices are approached. On my mom’s side, the food was more Portuguese-centric, with meat, vinegar and a lot of coconuts. Growing up in a household where you had these two disparate elements served on the dinner table at the same time seemed normal. I thought everybody had that. You had things that didn’t make sense together (but worked). 



Your blog is called ‘A Brown Table’ and has photos featuring your brown hands. Did negative comments to your brownness shock you?
My hands became a part of the photos because I like to showcase the instructional aspects of how food comes together. It was this process of cooking that I fell in love with and why I quit my job to go into food. Also, having worked in a kitchen, I noticed that people who prepared the food rarely came to the front of the restaurant. This was my way of representing them. 
A couple of years after starting the blog, I started getting anonymous comments about my skin being too dark and ashy. It is one thing to be critiqued on your work, and a different matter to be judged for things out of your control. I thought I’d give up but realised that I’m really passionate about food and that it would have meant these people had won. The comments subsided eventually.



What inspired you to tweak the traditional recipes you’d grown up eating?
The food I cook is from an immigrant’s perspective. I grew up in India, live in America and travel around the world. I’m trying to connect my past in India with my present in America, weaving all of that through food.



You write that “being openly gay in India was out of the question”. Was the US better?
I always knew I was gay but I couldn’t talk about it to anyone in India. America felt like a safer space. At the University of Cincinnati, I found a support group for students who were gay. That gave me the friendship that was needed. The hardest part was accepting that I was gay to myself. It took a little bit of time for my parents but they came around.



“Mine is the story of a gay immigrant, told through food”, you write. How do you view your work given the current debate on immigration?
Immigrants don’t have to cook with notions of traditional and authentic. There is no such thing as authentic food — you’re making a recipe that was handed down by someone in your family and to them by someone else. The other factor is being brown and gay —there aren’t many people in food media like me. We have to say hey, we can cook different things and we can cook them well.

Armaan Kohli secures bail in illegal alcohol possession case - Times of India

","
Actor Armaan Kohli, who was arrested on Thursday evening for allegedly stocking alcohol beyond permissible limit, secured bail in the case on Friday. 
A team of excise police officials raided Armaan’s Juhu home on Thursday and found Scotch whisky stocked beyond permissible limit. According to law, a person cannot possess more than 12 units of hard liquor in a month. The actor was taken to the excise department Q division’s Bandra office for further questioning later in the evening. He appeared before the Bandra court yesterday and was granted bail in the case. 

An official from the excise police department informed BT, “We raided Armaan Kohli’s home and seized 41 unopened bottles and 35 empty bottles of Scotch whisky, which is beyond the permissible limit. He was taken for further questioning and appeared before the court yesterday around 11 am.”

After securing bail, Armaan told BT, “I have secured bail for a bond of `20,000. I returned from Dubai on Tuesday and, along with six friends, bought 12 bottles of whisky from duty free, as I was planning to host a party a few days later. I have the required liquor permit and duty-free license. Unlike what has been claimed, I just had around 40 bottles, of which 19 were unopened. I spent the night at the Bandra excise office. I appeared before the court on Friday around 11.30 am and was granted bail on the basis of the proof I produced.” He adds, “Clearly, someone is after my life and wants to tarnish my image.”

This is not the first time Armaan has landed himself in a legal tangle. He was earlier accused of assaulting his ex-girlfriend Neeru Randhawa, and later, a family friend Nadia Hayat had lodged an FIR against him for threatening and verbally abusing her.

Sohrabuddin case: All 22 accused acquitted in Sohrabuddin encounter case 

","
MUMBAI: A special CBI court on Friday acquitted all 22 accused of the 

  2005 alleged fake encounters
 + of gangster Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife Kauser Bi. While 21 accused were junior-level police officials from Gujarat, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, one was the owner of the farmhouse where Sheikh and his wife were held before the alleged murders.


The accused were additionally also acquitted on charges of being involved in the 2006 alleged staged encounter of Tulsiram Prajapati, Sheikh’s associate and a witness to his alleged abduction. 

According to special CBI Judge S J Sharma, the prosecution failed to put forth any ""documentary and substantive evidence"" to suggest or establish the alleged conspiracy.

According to the CBI’s case, on November 23, 2005, Shaekh was allegedly abducted from a bus near Hyderabad while he was on his way to Sangli (Maharashtra) with his wife Kausar Bi. He was allegedly abducted by police personnel of ATS, Gujarat. The couple was then taken to Ahmedabad, and on November 26, 2005, Sohrabuddin was killed in a fake encounter by cops from the Gujarat and Rajasthan police. The CBI alleged that a few days later, Kausar Bi was killed and her body disposed of by burning it at a river bed near village Illol in Gujarat. Prajapati an alleged eyewitness and believed to be an associate of Sohrabuddin, was taken to Udaipur, Rajasthan. A year later, in December 2006, he too was killed in an alleged fake encounter near Chapri on the Gujarat-Rajasthan border, the CBI said.

The trial in the case commenced last December. Over the last year, 210 witnesses deposed, among whom 92 turned hostile. 

The case was transferred to a city court in 2012 following a Supreme Court order in 2010. Over the years, of the 38 accused booked initially, 16 including BJP president Amit Shah were discharged in the case.

Rare albino orangutan released back into the wild - Times of India

","
JAKARTA: The world's only known albino orangutan has been released back into the jungle more than a year after she was found emaciated and bloody in a remote corner of Borneo, an Indonesian NGO said Friday.


Environmentalists rescued ""Alba"" from a cage where she was being kept as a pet by villagers in Central Kalimantan in April last year.

She was found with dry blood smeared around her nose -- the result of her violent capture -- and weighed just 8 kilogrammes, the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation (BOSF) said.

The blue-eyed primate, covered in fuzzy white hair, was on Wednesday returned to the wild with her best friend, Kika, after leaving their rehabilitation centre.

""So far she's showing good signs of adapting,"" Nico Hermanu, a BOSF spokesman, told AFP.

""She's been climbing trees as high as 35 metres (about 115 feet) and has been eating fruit from the forest.""

Kika and Alba -- who is six years old and now 28 kilos -- will be monitored by conservation teams at Bukit Baka Bukit Raya National Park.

The rescue is a rare spot of bright news for the critically endangered species, which has seen its habitat shrink drastically over the past few decades largely due to the destruction of forests for logging, paper, palm oil and mining.

The population of orangutans in Borneo has plummeted from about 288,500 in 1973 to about 100,000 today, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

A string of fatal attacks on the great apes this year have been blamed on farmers and hunters.

Four Indonesian men were arrested over the killing of an orangutan shot some 130 times with an 
airrifle in February.

Borneo police have also arrested two rubber plantation workers and accused them of shooting an orangutan multiple times before decapitating it.

Plantation workers and villagers are sometimes known to attack the animal because they see it as a pest, while poachers also capture them to sell as pets.

Indian techie sentenced to nine years in prison for sexual assault inside plane - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: An Indian techie from Tamil Nadu was sentenced to nine years of imprisonment on Thursday on charges of a ""brazen sexual assault"" against a fellow female passenger inside a commercial airplane early this year.


Prabhu Ramamoorthy, 35, who came to the US on a H-1B visa in 2015, will be deported after he serves his sentence, a federal court in Detroit said as it sentenced the Indian national to nine years of imprisonment.

Judge Terrence Berge hoped it would be grave enough to deter others from committing similar crimes. Federal prosecutors had sought 11 years of imprisonment for Ramamoorthy.

""Everyone has the right to be secure and safe when they travel on airplanes. We will not tolerate the behaviour of anyone, who takes advantage of victims who are in a vulnerable position. We appreciate the victim in this case for her courage to speak out,"" US Attorney Matthew Schneider said after the sentencing was announced.

Ramamoorthy was convicted in August after a five-day trial that was conducted before United States District Judge Terrence Berg. The jury deliberated approximately three-and-a-half hours before returning the guilty verdict.

According to the evidence presented at the trial, on January 3, Ramamoorthy had engaged in a sexual act with a female, while she was sleeping on a flight from Las Vegas to Detroit. Ramamoorthy was seated along with his wife, when he sexually assaulted his co-passenger.

During the trial, the government admitted evidence demonstrating that Ramamoorthy had digitally penetrated the woman sleeping next to him during the overnight flight. The sexual assault woke her up, she found her pants unbuttoned and unzipped, and sought help from the flight attendants.

The sentence was proof that the safety and security of all aircraft passengers was a priority for the FBI, said Timothy R Slater, Special Agent in Charge, Detroit Division of the FBI.

In recent years, a number of Indian nationals have been arrested or charged with sexual assaults inside a plane. The FBI says airplane sexual assault is a serious offence that is on the rise. FBI statistics indicate that investigations of mid-air sexual assaults increased by 66 per cent from 2014 to 2017.

That was in part due to increasingly ""cramped, confined spaces; alcohol and drugs; fewer flight attendants; and dark cabins on night flights"" -- factors that ""likely embolden offenders"" -- the FBI said in a recent report.

The cramped style of airplane seating can exacerbate trauma for victims. According to mental health professionals, victims who are violated in confined spaces feel even more helpless, vulnerable and powerless. Victims may also feel intimidated by the person sitting next to them since the seating arrangement means that the perpetrator is effectively blocking the victim from getting up, according to the FBI.

According to court papers, Ramamoorthy is from Tamil Nadu, where he grew up. His parents are farmers. He came to the US in July, 2015 after his graduation to work as an IT professional.

During his trial, Ramamoorthy presented himself to the court as a confused man stranded in America without English language skills despite his sophisticated technological job, federal prosecutors alleged. ""His lack of empathy and remorse should not go unnoticed by this court,"" they argued, seeking nearly 11 years of imprisonment for him.

Delhi HC grants AJL two-week time to vacate Herald House 

","
NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court on Friday dismissed the petition filed by Associated Journals Ltd(AJL), publisher of National Herald, challenging the eviction order of October 30. The court has given two weeks time to AJL to vacate the premises at ITO. 


The Centre in its eviction order had mentioned a violation of 56-year-old lease conditions by the publisher. 

Justice Sunil Gaur, who was hearing the matter, had reserved his decision on November 22 on AJL's plea against the government's October 30 notice.

The court on the last date had asked the Centre what was the justification to re-enter the premises now when publication of National Herald has commenced.

The Centre and the Land and Development Office (L&DO) had told the court that re-entry notice was issued as it had initiated the proceedings back in 2016 when no printing or publishing activity was going on.

All the procedures have been followed to the hilt before issuing the notice for re-entry to AJL, it had said.

AJL had opposed the Centre's stand, saying that publication of web editions began in 2016 and the issue of absence of printing press in the premises was not raised then.

It had said the government kept silent till April 2018 when it again sent a notice for inspection and in which it had said that it was coming to check breaches mentioned in notice of October 10, 2016.

Merry Christmas 2018: How to Decorate Christmas Tree 

","
It is that time of the year again when we paint the town red with Christmas spirit. Gifts, reindeer, Christmas tree, lights and rum cakes, everything makes the environment cheerful setting the mood right for parties. It is just a week before we welcome Christmas 2018 and we all are doing our bits for decorating the house and the tree. Here are few ideas that might help you to decorate the tree and cheer up your friends and family. 


Red ribbon
Nothing beats the attractiveness of a traditional Christmas tree. It is very easy to go traditional. After decorating the tree with the ornaments, just wrap the tree with a broad red ribbon.


Lights
LED lights definitely adds a lot of spunk to the Christmas tree. You can choose from red lights to white, pink or yellow, whichever suits best with your interiors and tree decorations.


Decide a colour palette
Another interesting way to decorate the tree this year could be deciding a colour theme. You can choose from a blue and white, red and gold or pink and green theme or you can create your own colour palette. Once you decide the theme, choose all decorations according to the theme colour. It definitely looks striking.


White Christmas tree
 
You can also ditch the regular tree and get a white Christmas tree. It looks brilliant and striking and the decorations on the tree stand out too.


Ditch red, make it pink
Try to ditch regular red decorations and instead pick pink. Pink makes the tree look a little younger and the monotone decorations look very striking too.


Monogram

Infographic: The internet lacks language diversity - Times of India

","
Ten languages account for nearly 90 per cent of the top 10 million websites -- a tiny fraction of the world’s 7,097 languages.

For native English speakers – around 5% of the global population – there isn’t much difference between real life and online life, since more than half of the web is in their language. But those who cannot speak or understand English, much of the internet is out of reach. 

Clearly, the absence of so many languages creates a so-called digital divide, that may restrict access to data and information. So while in one sense, the internet opens the door for anyone to create content in any language, many languages are just not present in the online space.

Former South African President Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.” The internet needs to a cue from this.

#MeToo movement: Alok Nath’s lawyer says Vinta Nanda’s allegations are imaginary 

","
It wouldn’t be wrong to say that actress Tanushree Dutta Dutta’s allegations of sexual harassment against Nana Patekar was somewhere the beginning of #MeToo movement in India, especially Bollywood. Many prominent names have come up who have been accused of sexual misconduct. And one of the shocking names has been that of Alok Nath. 

According to reports in India Today, a hearing took place in the Vinta Nanda and Alok Nath case yesterday where the senior actor’s advocate DN Goburdhun, has lashed out at Vinta Nanda and called her a delusional complainant and a woman who drank alcohol, indulged in drugs and had relationships with married men with children. 
He reportedly said that she probably wanted some unrelenquished love from the actor and quashed her complaint as mere publicity. Not just this, the advocate also said that Vinta wanted to create marital discord between Nath and his wife as she forced the veteran actor to shoot a kissing scene in the serial at one point of time two decades ago despite the actor’s objection as his wife did not approve of such scenes.

D N Goburdhun has also reportedly termed the writer-producer's rape allegation an imaginative story and that she did not cooperate with the police during the investigation and was busy attending film festivals.

To all these allegations, Nanda's lawyer Dhruti Kapadia reportedly objected saying that he only wanted to do character assassination of Vinta.

North Korea says it won’t denuclearize unless US removes threat - Times of India

","
SEOUL: North Korea said on Thursday it will never unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons unless the United States removes its nuclear threat first, a statement that raises further doubts on whether leader Kim Jong Un will ever relinquish an arsenal he may see as his greatest guarantee of survival.


The statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency came amid a deadlock in nuclear negotiations between the United States and North Korea over the sequencing of the denuclearization process and removal of international sanctions.

Kim and President Donald Trump met June 12 in Singapore where they issued a vague goal for the ""complete denuclearization"" of the Korean Peninsula without describing when and how it would occur.

But North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of denuclearization that bears no resemblance to the American definition, vowing to pursue nuclear development until the United States removes its troops and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan. In Thursday's statement, the North reiterated its traditional stance on denuclearization and accused Washington of misleading what had been agreed on in Singapore.

""The United States must now recognize the accurate meaning of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and especially, must study geography the right way,"" the statement said.

""When we talk about the Korean Peninsula, it includes the territory of our republic and also the entire region of (South Korea) where the United States has placed its invasive force, including nuclear weapons. When we talk about the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it means the removal of all sources of nuclear threat, not only from the South and North but also from areas neighboring the Korean Peninsula,"" the statement said.

The US removed its tactical nuclear weapons from South Korea in the 1990s.

The nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang stalled since the Trump-Kim meeting. The United States wants North Korea to provide a detailed account of nuclear and missile facilities that would be inspected and dismantled under a potential deal, while the North is insisting that sanctions be lifted first.

The North Korean statement came a day after Stephen Biegun, the Trump's administration's special envoy on North Korea, told reporters in South Korea that Washington was reviewing easing travel restrictions on North Korea to facilitate humanitarian shipments to help resolve the impasse in nuclear negotiations.

Bird flu: Culling of birds ordered in Bihar's Munger 

","
MUNGER: Culling of birds had been ordered in four villages of Munger district as outbreak of bird flu had been confirmed in those areas, a senior state government official said on Friday.

Divisional commissioner, Munger, Pankaj Kumar Pal said though bird flu had been confirmed in some areas of Munger district, no case of avian influenza in any person had been reported so far.


Following reports of birds dying in some villages under Ghoraho Panchayat, samples were sent to a medical lab in Kolkata for tests wherein strains of the H5N1 virus were confirmed, he said.

""Culling of birds has, therefore, been ordered in four villages falling under the panchayat Chakhand, Amaiya, Belsira and Aphroj. A central team has reached the villages with the necessary paraphernalia. Besides, those in the poultry business are being compensated,"" Pal told mediapersons.

""Although no humans have so far been found to be afflicted by the virus, antiviral drug Tamiflu is being made available in the affected region as a precautionary measure. An advisory has also been issued asking the people to avoid coming into contact with any migratory wild birds or consumption of their meat,"" the commissioner added.

Maharashtra Snooping row: Govt defends order allowing 10 central agencies to monitor, decrypt 'any' computers, opposition slams move 

","
NEW DELHI: The government on Friday defended its recent order to authorise 10 central agencies

  to intercept ""any information"" on computers
 + , saying the authorisation was given under old rules. The opposition was, however, up in arms over the issue.




Responding to Congress leader Anand Sharma's charge in the Rajya Sabha, finance minister Arun Jaitley said it would have been better if the opposition had obtained all the information before raising the issue. ""On December 20, same order of authorisation was repeated that was existing since 2009. You are make a mountain where a molehill does not exist,"" Jaitley said.

""When senior members from opposition raise an issue every word spoken by them has precious value and therefore they must know facts,"" Jaitley told the House.

He said the rules under which agencies have been authorised to intercept were framed in 2009 when the Congress-led UPA government was in power. The authorisation has been issued under the same rules. Since the Act has been in place these orders of authorisation are repeated from time to time, he stated.

The order issued late on Thursday night authorises 10 agencies such as the Intelligence Bureau, Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate to intercept, monitor, and decrypt “any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer resource under the said Act (section 69 of the IT Act, 2000).” The order was passed by the 'cyber and information security' division of the Union home ministry under the authority of home secretary Rajiv Gauba.

According to the order, the subscriber or service provider or any person in charge of the computer resource will be bound to extend all facilities and technical assistance to the agencies. Failing to do so will invite seven-year imprisonment and fine.


OPPOSITION CALLS ORDER 'UNCONSITUTIONAL'
The opposition has called the order 'unconstitutional, undemocratic and an assault on fundamental rights'. Parties including the CPM, Samajwadi Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Trinamool Congress said they would collectively oppose the home ministry's order, adding that the BJP government was converting the country into a surveillance state.

""From Modi Sarkar to stalker sarkar, clearly the string of losses has left the BJP government desperate for information,"" the Congress said on its official Twitter handle.



The Congress president alleged that the government is trying to convert the country into a ""police state"".



But the government was quick to hit back.

BJP president Amit Shah immediately hit back at Rahul's barb. In a series of tweets, he accused the Congress president of ""fear mongering"" and playing politics with national security.


Yet again Rahul does fear-mongering and plays politics with national security. UPA put no barriers on unlawful sur… https://t.co/ceZVeJIjUd— Amit Shah (@AmitShah) 1545398506000

There were only 2 insecure dictators in the history of India. One imposed emergency and the other wanted unrestric… https://t.co/qj5loiYYYI— Amit Shah (@AmitShah) 1545398480000
Section 69 of the IT Act deals with the ""power to issue directions for interception or monitoring or decryption of any information through any computer resource"". It provides that the central government or a state government or any of its officers can direct any agency to intercept or decrypt any information for the purpose of national security.

According to the government, the recent notification does not confer any new powers. Adequate provisions are provided in the IT Act 2000. Similar provisions and procedures already exist in the Telegraph Act along with identical safeguards. The present notification is analogous to the authorisation issued under the Telegraph Act. The entire process is also subject to a robust review mechanism as in case of the Telegraph Act.

In 2009, the UPA government had brought the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption of Information) Rules, 2009 to define the procedure and safeguards for such interception. 

According to these rules, ‘no person shall carry out the interception or decryption of any information except by an order issued by the competent authority’. It also states that‘the competent authority may authorise an agency of the government to intercept or decrypt information.

However, although the UPA government made it compulsory that only authorised agencies can carry out surveillance, it did not specifically name the authorised agencies, which left the ruling open to misuse for unlawful and illegal surveillance.

In its recent order, the present Modi government has made the ruling more specific - authorising 10 agencies for the purpose of surveillance for national security -- the Intelligence Bureau, Narcotics Control Bureau, Enforcement Directorate, Central Board of Direct Taxes, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Central Bureau of Investigation, National Investigation Agency, Cabinet Secretariat (R&AW), Directorate of Signal Intelligence (For service areas of Jammu & Kashmir, North-East and Assam only) and Commissioner of Police, Delhi.

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said this will ensure that any interception, monitoring or decryption of any information through any computer resource is done as according to the law. Every individual case will continue to require prior approval of the home ministry or the state government, the MHA stated, also clarifying that it has not delegated its powers to any law enforcement or security.

Taxing conventional cars to promote electric vehicles will not serve purpose: Maruti Suzuki Chairman - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: Imposing cess on conventional vehicles to promote electric cars will not serve the purpose as only the rich would end up receiving subsidies, Maruti Suzuki Chairman R C Bhargava said Wednesday. 


Also read: 

  New cars may face Rs 12,000 levy in govt bid to push e-vehicles
 +

 Insisting that only cars should not be levied cess to promote electric vehicles (EVs), he also said two-wheelers, which consume two-thirds of petrol in the country, must not be left out in the electrification drive as these are much easier to be charged at homes. 

 ""The biggest problem in India is the large number of small cars. Around 70 per cent of these cars could not be parked at homes and thus cannot be charged. I don't think that small car electrification can happen on the basis of subsidies. We need technology for that,"" Bhargava told reporters here. 

 The chairman of the country's largest car maker was commenting on a report of a proposal to impose cess of Rs 500-Rs 25,000 on conventional vehicles to promote clean energy vehicles in the country.

 Bhargava said all around the globe, including the US and Europe, electrification of cars has met with little success so far. 

 He said if a cess has to be there then two-wheelers also need to be taxed. 

 ""If the principle is that a polluter pays then two-wheelers are also polluters. Why not a cess on two-wheelers also, so that the cess of petrol two-wheelers is utilised to subsidise electric two-wheelers,"" Bhargava said. 

 Two-thirds of petrol in the country is consumed by two-wheelers, and electrification of two-wheelers becomes, so far, more practical in terms of infrastructure than electrification of cars, he added. 

 Bhargava stated that with 85-87 per cent car parc in India between now and 2030 set to be non electric cars, it is important to look at the problem in a holistic manner. 

 Parc refers to the total number of registered vehicles plying in the country. 

 ""By then (2030), if you like to reduce oil import and pollution, what are your options? Your options are CNG, hybrid and biofuels. All these three technologies are required,"" Bhargava said. 

 He said the better way to achieve target of having a lower fuel import bill and reduction in air pollution is by supporting CNG vehicles. 

 ""If at all there is a cess on internal combustion vehicles, why not use this fund to build CNG infrastructure? It will happen quickly and give results quickly as well...even with infrastructure shortage, sales of CNG cars have been going up,"" Bhargava noted. 

 Bhargava also sought a lower goods and services tax for a hybrid vehicle which is a ""very eco-friendly technology"". 

 ""EV is not the only technology. It is a means to an end and not an end in itself,"" he said urging policymakers to consider other technologies as well. 

 Commenting on the company's plans, he said Maruti Suzuki India is looking to introduce a strong hybrid technology in its petrol cars that would help increase fuel efficiency by as much as 30 per cent. 

 The company would get the technology as part of the Toyota-Suzuki collaboration. 

 ""By April 2020, when BS-VI emission norm is implemented, the cost of a diesel vehicle is expected to be around Rs 2.5 lakh more expensive than a petrol variant. Customers will then decide whether to go for diesel or petrol...our production will have to be naturally adjusted with customer demand,"" he said.

UK doctors sceptical that AI could replace them: Study - Times of India

","
LONDON: Although artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to disrupt health care, doctors in the UK are sceptical of the technology entirely replacing them, according to a survey.


The study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, investigated primary care physicians' views on AI's looming impact on health professions.

When it came to predictions about the future of medicine, British general physicians (GPs) were generally sceptical that they could be entirely replaced by AI.

""To our knowledge this is the first national survey that explores medical professionals' opinions about how AI will impact the future of a medical specialty,"" said Charlotte Blease, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Harvard Medical School in the US.

""The results suggest a disconnection between the views of experts in medical AI and practicing physicians: the overwhelming majority of general practitioners were unconvinced about the potential for technology to replace them especially when it comes to empathetic patient care,"" said Blease.

The researchers asked physicians about the likelihood that future technology would be able to fully replace the average GP in performing six different medical tasks.

These tasks include diagnostics, prognostics or evaluating when to refer patients to specialists, formulating personalised treatment plans for patients, providing empathic care, and updating patient documentation.

About half of GPs surveyed believed it likely or very likely that AI would be able to replace them in making patient prognoses in the future.

Eighty per cent of respondents believed it likely or very likely that future technology would be able to fully undertake duties related to patient documentation, such as updating medical records.

However, the overwhelming majority of UK GPs studied (94 per cent) believed it was unlikely or extremely unlikely that technology will be able to provide empathic care to patients as well as or better than the average GP.

Nearly seven in 10 UK GPs surveyed believed that it was unlikely or very unlikely that future technology would be able to outperform the average GP when it came to diagnosing patients.

Over 60 per cent of GPs believed it is unlikely or very unlikely that technology would ever be able to replace doctors in decisions about when to refer patients to specialists.

A similar number of GPs was cynical about replacement when it comes to formulating personal treatment plans for patients.

Against their general scepticism about AI, the study found that GPs appeared optimistic that future technology could undertake certain automated tasks, such as paper work.

""Overwhelmingly, general practitioners also believed that artificial intelligence could never replace them on empathy -- yet this is a skill that does not require special medical expertise,"" said Blease.

""Our findings raise important questions about how current and future physicians integrate and harness the power of artificial intelligence, which could ultimately improve the delivery of care to patients,"" he said.

Dawood: IIT-Bombay scores record number of offers, salaries up too 

","
MUMBAI: With the first phase of placement season at IIT-Bombay coming to an end this week, the institute has secured an all-time high in the number of offers. A total of 1,270 offers were received at the campus this year, of which 1,122 were accepted. The number of international offers, too, went up from 65 last year to 89 this year. The institute saw international offers pouring in from US, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea. 


Not only is there a steep rise in the total number of offers at the institute, the average salary package offered in the first phase of placements has also jumped from last year's Rs 12-13 lakh/annum to Rs 17.75 lakh/annum this year, indicating an upbeat season. Of the total students registered, 70% have already been placed in this phase. However, students claimed not all registered opt for placements. Some pursue higher studies too, they added.

The highest international offer remained from Microsoft which offered Rs 1.5 crore for positions at their Redmond, Washington, office. Samsung made 27 offers- the highest by a single company - for positions in Korea, Bengaluru, Noida and Delhi. Sector-wise, engineering and technology firms picked the maximum students. The average pay package was the best in IT/software sectors with a CTC of Rs21.29 lakh/annum.

""Statistics this year have proved IIT-Bombay was the most preferred destination for recruiters. The steep rise in the numbers of offers is made possible due to adoption of new placement policies respecting both students and companies, allowing alumni mentoring and common aptitude test,"" said an official statement issued by the placement cell.

The next placement phase will commence in January. While the 1,270 offers were made by 361 companies, the institute is expecting more to join in the second phase. Three PSUs offered 13 jobs in the first phase, while more are expected to line up in the next phase.

Sohrabuddin case: All 22 accused acquitted in Sohrabuddin encounter case

MUMBAI: A special CBI court on Friday acquitted all 22 accused of the 

  2005 alleged fake encounters
 + of gangster Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife Kauser Bi. While 21 accused were junior-level police officials from Gujarat, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, one was the owner of the farmhouse where Sheikh and his wife were held before the alleged murders.


The accused were additionally also acquitted on charges of being involved in the 2006 alleged staged encounter of Tulsiram Prajapati, Sheikh’s associate and a witness to his alleged abduction. 

According to special CBI Judge S J Sharma, the prosecution failed to put forth any ""documentary and substantive evidence"" to suggest or establish the alleged conspiracy.

According to the CBI’s case, on November 23, 2005, Shaekh was allegedly abducted from a bus near Hyderabad while he was on his way to Sangli (Maharashtra) with his wife Kausar Bi. He was allegedly abducted by police personnel of ATS, Gujarat. The couple was then taken to Ahmedabad, and on November 26, 2005, Sohrabuddin was killed in a fake encounter by cops from the Gujarat and Rajasthan police. The CBI alleged that a few days later, Kausar Bi was killed and her body disposed of by burning it at a river bed near village Illol in Gujarat. Prajapati an alleged eyewitness and believed to be an associate of Sohrabuddin, was taken to Udaipur, Rajasthan. A year later, in December 2006, he too was killed in an alleged fake encounter near Chapri on the Gujarat-Rajasthan border, the CBI said.

The trial in the case commenced last December. Over the last year, 210 witnesses deposed, among whom 92 turned hostile. 

The case was transferred to a city court in 2012 following a Supreme Court order in 2010. Over the years, of the 38 accused booked initially, 16 including BJP president Amit Shah were discharged in the case.

FIFA World Cup final drew global audience of 1.12 billion

ZURICH: A combined global audience of 1.12 billion watched the World Cup final between France and Croatia in July, FIFA, the governing body of world football, said on Friday.


In total, FIFA said, a ""combined 3.572 billion viewers - more than half of the global population aged four and over - tuned in to world football's ultimate competition"" for at least a minute, over the course of the World Cup's from June 14 to July 15.

A survey it had commissioned by FIFA found that 3.04 billion viewers caught at least three minutes, a 10.9 per cent increase on Brazil 2014, and 2.49 billion watched at least 30 minutes, or one third of one match, up on 2014's 1.95 billion.

FIFA calculated that the average live audience for each of the 64 matches was 191 million.

The survey estimated that 9.5 per cent of that audience, or 309.7 million people, watched no coverage at home but ""caught the action on digital platforms, in public viewing areas or in bars and restaurants.""

That proportion was higher for the final between France and Croatia. FIFA said 884.37 million viewers tuning in to traditional TV coverage and a further 231.82 million watching outside the home or digitally.

""It's not the same as a tournament. It is a team event. You enjoy playing a team event. For us it's sometimes like a festival. We see so many matches. Youngsters also benefit. Badminton is growing now because of the performances (of the top shuttlers) and because of the league,"" insisted the 2012 London Olympic Games women's singles bronze medallist.

Reigning Olympic and world women's singles champion Carolina Marin agreed with Saina.

""The pressure is much different. For us, we have to think about team not ourselves,"" said Marin who is to captain league debutantes Pune 7 Aces.

National badminton coach Pullela Gopichand said the league has helped someone like Kidambi Srikanth over the last three years to improve his game at the international level.

""Take for example Srikanth -- the league has helped him. It has helped even (doubles players) Satviksairaj Rankireddy and Ashwini (Ponappa) who got a lot of confidence after playing in it.

""There has been a huge positive response from junior players who have travelled with the teams. So many have benefited from being part of the teams - playing or not playing,"" said Gopi.

Atul Pande of the franchise league organisers Sportzlive (under the aegis of the Badminton Association of India) said the only window the Badminton World Federation provides them was now (in December).

""In Super Series events they (players) have to play a match every day but here it's usually once every third day. It's easier on the body,"" he explained.

He conceded that the franchises were yet to make a profit.

""Generally speaking, no. Without prize money no, they are not making money. It's like so many other leagues. At this point of time the central revenue pool is not enough for the franchises to break even. It takes time to increase the pool,"" he said.

Sajjan Kumar: Delhi HC dismisses Sajjan Kumar's plea for extension of time to surrender 

","
NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Friday dismissed Sajjan Kumar's plea seeking an extension of time to surrender in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case, saying it found no ground for granting the relief.


The former Congress leader had on December 20 ( Thursday) 

  sought time from the court till January 30
 + to surrender after being recently sentenced to life imprisonment, saying he had to settle family affairs, including those related to property. The convicted ex-member of parliament is married and has three children and eight grandchildren.

The high court had earlier this week directed the 73-year-old to surrender before authorities by December 31 after holding him guilty.




Sajjan Kumar convicted in 1984 anti-Sikh riots case: What the Delhi HC said in its verdictThe Delhi high court on Monday sentenced Congress leader Sajjan Kumar to life in the first conviction of a politician in the deadly anti-Sikh riots in 1984, holding it was perpetrated by those with ""political patronage"" and pushed for a new law for speedy prosecution of genocide and mass killings.


""The applicant is at present under shock and surprise in view of the order of acquittal being set aside and him being convicted, although the applicant believes he in innocent,"" the plea stated.

In his plea, Kumar also said he wants to approach the Supreme Court through a senior lawyer, but as the apex court is on vacation, most senior advocates are on holiday.

“The applicant is the best person to brief his counsel and inform them about the facts. The applicant prays that he be granted further extension of 30 days so as to enable him to settle his family affairs to meet his close relatives, near and dear ones including friends who have been associated with him over a period of 73 years,” it said.

The Delhi high court convicted and awarded life term “till the remainder of his life” to Kumar in a case relating to the killing of five Sikhs in Raj Nagar part-I in Palam Colony in southwest Delhi on November 1-2, 1984, and burning down of a gurdwara in Raj Nagar part II during that period.

The riots had broken out after the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984 by her two Sikh bodyguards.

BJP rath yatra Bengal: Calcutta high court puts BJP's rath yatra in West Bengal on hold for now 

","
KOLKATA: A division bench of the Calcutta high court on Friday quashed a single bench order that had allowed BJP's 'Rath Yatra' in West Bengal and asked it to hear the case afresh to consider intelligence inputs by state agencies.


The single-judge bench of Tapabrata Chakraborty was asked to dispose the matter expeditiously after considering whether there were adequate materials to arrive at the conclusion to allow the 'yatra' as proposed by the BJP.

The division bench said the order needs to consider afresh with the 36 intelligence inputs submitted by the state government before the single bench.

Advocate General Kishore Dutta, representing the state, said that the single bench had not considered the intelligence inputs submitted to it in a sealed cover and had returned it to him without even opening it.

He had submitted intelligence inputs from 31 police districts and five police commisionerates before the bench, which he said talked about apprehension of communal unrest if the BJP's proposed roadshows were allowed.

The 'Rath Yatra', which was originally scheduled to start on December 7 but was denied permission by the state government, has become the latest political flashpoint between the saffron party and the state's ruling Trinamool Congress.

After hearing an appeal by the BJP, a single-judge bench of the high court had on Thursday allowed the mega event, to be flagged off by BJP president Amit Shah under a re-scheduled programme from December 28 to 31.

The West Bengal government, however, challenged the ruling before a division bench of Chief Justice Debasish Kargupta and Justice Shampa Sarkar, which has now quashed the earlier ruling and sent the case back to the single-judge bench.

In its appeal, the government expressed urgency and sought immediate hearing of the matter.

Setting aside the denial of permission by the state government, the single-judge bench had allowed the 'yatra' while noting that courts can interfere if administrative authorities exercise their discretionary powers in a whimsical manner.

Following the court order, the BJP had come up with tentative new dates for its proposed three-phase programme.

After the new order, there is uncertainty once again over the mega event that was to cover all 42 Lok Sabha constituencies in the state ahead of the 2019 general elections.

Earlier on December 6, the same single-judge bench had refused permission to the BJP to hold the 'Rath Yatra', which was scheduled to be flagged off by Shah from Cooch Behar on December 7. The party had then approached the division bench.

The division bench had then asked the state chief secretary, the home secretary and the director general of police to hold a meeting with representatives of the BJP and take a decision on the 'yatra' by December 14.

After parleys with the BJP team, the three officers refused permission for the rallies on December 15 on grounds that they might lead to communal tensions.

Following this, the state BJP had moved the court of Justice Chakraborty again challenging the government's denial of permission and had got a go-ahead on Thursday.

‘I used to be Shashi Tharoor from Churchgate’ 

","
It was an interesting evening recently, at Fr. Agnel Institute, Bandra, as Dr Shashi Tharoor, author and Member of Parliament, launched his latest tome, ‘The Paradoxical Prime Minister’, to a packed hall. Students, book lovers and others attended the event that saw Tharoor throw light on his book in a discussion with Sanjay Jha, laced with humour, wit and a few anecdotes.


‘Write whenever you can, read whenever you can and think even if you can’t’
After a handshake, Sanjay welcomed Tharoor to the stage, to which the latter quipped, “As long as I don’t have to play Sambit Patra this evening,” as everyone joined in with laughter at the light-hearted remark. Sanjay started by saying that a lot of folks called him the, ‘Shashi Tharoor of Ghatkopar’, and that it may have something to do with his predilection for using abstruse words. To that Tharoor said, “I used to be Shashi Tharoor from Churchgate’. I grew up bang opposite a neon ‘SO’ sign on road heading towards the Bandstand. The building opposite that, Kasturi Buildings, is where I lived on the fourth floor for 10 years.” He also spoke about his writing mantra. Sanjay remarked how Shashi’s books were well-researched, they were vastly entertaining and that the humour in them came across so well. “Three books in the course of the last two-and-a-half-years, how do you do it.? he asked him. Replied Shashi, “The short answer was given by an American humourist in the 1940s who said, ‘I write faster than anybody who writes better and I write better than anybody who writes faster. That’s my motto as well. Another thing is, I also honestly feel that those who claim they can’t find time, you never find time if you’ve lost it in the first place.” 

Tharoor added a few words of advice. He said, “I’ve written paragraphs by a resting a page against a steering wheel of a car. Those paragraphs have survived and found their way into a novel. I’ve done bits on a laptop and on a mobile phone on a moving aircraft, so it depends, but the thing is, write whenever you can, read whenever you can and think even if you can’t.” 
He shared a few more stories and anecdotes of his meetings with the Prime Minister. The evening ended with book signing.

US fed rake hike: US Fed raises interest rates, 4th time this year - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: After weeks of market volatility and calls by President Donald Trump for the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates, the US central bank instead did it again, and stuck by a plan to keep withdrawing support from an economy it views as strong.

US stocks and bond yields fell hard. With the Fed signaling ""some further gradual"" rate hikes and no break from cutting its massive bond portfolio, traders fretted that policymakers could choke off economic growth.

""Maybe they have already committed their policy error,"" said Fritz Folts, chief investment strategist at 3Edge Asset Management. ""We would be in the camp that they have already raised rates too much.""

Interest rate futures show traders are currently betting the Fed won't raise rates at all next year.

Wednesday's rate increase, the fourth of the year, pushed the central bank's key overnight lending rate to a range of 2.25 percent to 2.50 percent.

In a news conference after the release of the policy statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank would continue trimming its balance sheet by $50 billion each month, and left open the possibility that continued strong data could force it to raise rates to the point where they start to brake the economy's momentum.

Powell did bow to what he called recent ""softening"" in global growth, tighter financial conditions, and expectations the US economy will slow next year, and said that with inflation expected to remain a touch below the Fed's 2 percent target next year, policymakers can be ""patient.""

Fresh economic forecasts showed officials at the median now see only two more rate hikes next year compared to the three projected in September.

But another message was clear in the statement issued after the Fed's last policy meeting of the year as well as in Powell's comments: The US economy continues to perform well and no longer needs the Fed's support either through lower-than-normal interest rates or by maintaining of a massive balance sheet.

""Policy does not need to be accommodative,"" he said.

In its statement, the Fed said risks to the economy were ""roughly balanced"" but that it would ""continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook.""

The Fed also made a widely expected technical adjustment, raising the rate it pays on banks' excess reserves by just 20 basis points to give it better control over the policy rate and keep it within the targeted range.


Choppy waters

The decision to raise borrowing costs again is likely to anger Trump, who has repeatedly attacked the central bank's tightening this year as damaging to the economy.

The Fed has been raising rates to reduce the boost that monetary policy gives to the economy, which is growing faster than what central bank policymakers view as a sustainable rate.

There are worries, however, that the economy could enter choppy waters next year as the fiscal boost from the Trump administration's spending and $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades and the global economy slows.

""I think that markets were looking for more in terms of the pause,"" said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia.

""It's not as dovish as expected, but I do believe the Fed will ultimately back off even further as we move into the new year.""

The benchmark S&P 500 index tumbled to a 15-month low, extending a streak of volatility that has dogged the market since late September. The index is down nearly 15 percent from its record high.

Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields fell as low as 2.75 percent, the lowest since April 4.


Economic projections

Fed policymakers' median forecast puts the federal funds rate at 3.1 percent at the end of 2020 and 2021, according to the projections.

That would leave borrowing costs just above policymakers' newly downgraded median view of a 2.8 percent neutral rate that neither brakes nor boosts a healthy economy, but still within the 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent range of Fed estimates for that rate.

Powell parried three questions about whether the Fed intended to restrict the economy with its rate policy, but gave little away.

""There would be circumstances in which it would be appropriate for us to go past neutral, and there would be circumstances in which it would be wholly inappropriate to do so.""

Gross domestic product is forecast to grow 2.3 percent next year and 2.0 percent in 2020, slightly weaker than the Fed previously anticipated. The unemployment rate, currently at a 49-year low of 3.7 percent, is expected to fall to 3.5 percent next year and rise slightly in 2020 and 2021.

Inflation, which hit the central bank's 2 percent target this year, is expected to be 1.9 percent next year, a bit lower than the 2.0 percent forecast three months ago.

There were no dissents in the Fed's policy decision.

Not just Vijay Mallya, govt trying to get back 58 looters & scooters 

","
NEW DELHI: The government informed Parliament on Wednesday that Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi, Nitin and Chetan Sandesara, Lalit Modi and European middlemen Guido Ralph Haschke and Carlo Gerosa are among 58 economic offenders living abroad who are being pursued through look out circulars (LoCs), Interpol red notices and extradition requests. 


Out of these 58, the government and investigation agencies — CBI, ED and DRI — are currently pursuing at least 16 extradition requests in the UAE, UK, Belgium, Egypt, the US and Antigua and Barbuda. The detailed reply filed by the ministry of external affairs in Lok Sabha on Wednesday reveals that government has sent fresh extradition requests for VVIP chopper scam middlemen —Guido Haschke and Carlo Gerosa — to Italy in October. 

Earlier, CBI had sent extradition requests for Gerosa in November 2017 and Haschke in January 2018, which were returned by Italian authorities. Investigators say that Haschke and Gerosa are important to connect the missing link in VVIP chopper scam as Christian Michel has already been extradited recently from the UAE. About Nirav Modi, the MEA reply said that while a red notice has already been issued against him, the UK has been approached with two separate extradition requests against him in August while separate extradition requests have been sent to the UAE against the diamantaire, his brother Neeshal and close aide Subhash Parab, since they may visit there. For Neeshal, separate extradition request has also been sent to Belgium and for Parab, a request has been sent to Egypt. 

Similarly, two extradition requests have been sent for Choksi to Antigua and a red notice has recently been issued against him by the Interpol, making him an international fugitive. Gujarat-based businessman Ashish Jobanputra and his wife Priti are being pursued through extradition requests to the US. About Lalit Modi, former IPL commissioner, the government said that his “money trail” was being pursued through LRs sent to Singapore, Hong Kong, the UAE and Mauritius while hunt is also on for middlemen Deepak Talwar (said to be in the UAE) and Sanjay Bhandari (in London). Talwar specifically is being sought from the UAE through the mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT). 

About the Sandesaras, accused of cheating banks of Rs 5,000 crore through their company Sterling Biotech, the government said red corner notice against Chetan, Nitin, Dipti Sandesaras and one Hiteshkumar Patel are under process. Former liquor baron Vijay Mallya’s extradition has already been ordered by a UK court last week. “Efforts are being made for securing presence of these accused in the country by way of issuance of LOC (Look Out Circulars), RCN (Red Corner Notice) and extradition requests,” said minister of state Gen (retired) V K Singh.

UN climate talks run into overtime, but deal 'in reach' - Times of India

","
KATOWICE (POLAND): United Nations' climate talks to agree on the rules of the 2015 Paris Agreement dragged on into an extra day on Saturday as ministers tried to overcome the last political hurdles after working through the night.


The schedule for the closing plenary, when sparks could fly among nations if there are issues in the text still open to opposition, has been repeatedly pushed back to later in the day - a sign a more diplomacy work needs to be done.

Some exhausted negotiators were seen leaving the conference venue in Katowice, Poland, in the early hours of Saturday morning to get a few hours' rest but many ministers worked through the night to try and iron out differences.

Despite this, European climate commissioner Miguel Arias Canete seemed optimistic on Saturday morning.

""UN climate talks go into overtime. Latest version of the draft agreement just out...A deal to make the Paris Agreement operational is within reach,"" he tweeted.

The last stumbling blocks have been around the ambition of developed countries' emissions cut pledges which countries more vulnerable to climate change are trying to increase.

Another sticking point remains over accounting rules for future carbon market mechanisms. A senior negotiator said Brazil still had concerns over the rules aimed at avoiding double counting emissions cuts.

""There are still a range of possible outcomes and Brazil continues to work constructively with other parties to find a workable pathway forward,"" Antonio Marcondes, Brazil's chief negotiator, told Reuters.

Countries are on a self-imposed deadline to produce a ""rulebook"" to flesh out details of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to limit the global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius and which comes into force in 2020.

Talks in Katowice have been going on for two weeks and were due to end on Dec. 14 but they have been clouded by political divisions.

A rift last week over how to express the importance of a UN commissioned report on keeping global warming within a 1.5 degrees Celsius limit appears to have been calmed, with language changed to ""note"" rather than ""welcome"" the report.

Talks have also faltered over increasing finance for climate adaptation for poorer countries. Governments have already agreed to raise $100 billion a year by 2020, but developing countries wanted more.

The latest text says a meeting in 2020 will start ""deliberations"" to increase that amount.

Niti Aayog: Cap civil services entry age at 27 years 

","
NEW DELHI: Government think tank Niti Aayog has prescribed reducing upper age limit to join the civil services to 27 years from the present 30 years for general category candidates by 2022-23 in a phased manner and also to have one integrated exam for all civil services. 


It has recommended creation of a central talent pool of all recruits, which would subsequently allocate candidates by matching their competencies and the job description of the posts. In the “Strategy for New India @75” report, the think tank has suggested the roadmap to reduce the number of civil services through rationalisation and harmonisation of services. 

Currently, there are more than 60 plus separate civil services at central and state levels. Sources said currently the average age of recruits for civil services is about 25-and-a-half years and the recommendation goes well with the reality that more than one-third of India’s population is below 35 years. The report has also recommended encouraging lateral entry of specialists at higher levels of government, which will provide much needed expertise. 

“The key to reform in the civil services is encouraging officers to cultivate specialisations based on their education and skills early on in their careers. Wherever possible, longer tenure postings need to be made based on the officers’ expertise. However, it is also necessary to ensure cross-sector mobility for civil servants from areas where they have become surplus to areas of emerging importance,” the report said.

Maharashtra BJP survey finds 2014 Lok Sabha wave ebbing, Sena crucial to success 

","
MUMBAI: According to an assessment based on a recent internal BJP survey, even if the party contests the 2019 Lok Sabha election in alliance with the Shiv Sena, a repeat of the 2014 performance is not likely in the state. The BJP-Shiv-Sena combine had secured 41 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in the state in the 2014 election. After a bypoll loss, BJP has 22 of the 48 seats, the Sena has 18, the Congress holds two, the NCP has 5, and one seat is held by the Swabhimani Paksha. 


""If we contest the Lok Sabha polls jointly, we will win fewer than 30 to 34 seats and if we contest separately, the BJP may win 15 to 18 seats, while the Shiv Sena will be able to secure five to eight seats. In that event, the Congress-NCP combine will win 22 to 28 seats,"" a former BJP minister said. The survey was conducted among the rank and file of the party across the state. The former BJP minister said party president Amit Shah was insistent on an alliance with the Sena to boost the tally for both parties. ""Shah felt that all-out efforts should be made to reach out to Shiv Sena and ensure that BJP-Shiv-Sena repeats the 2014 performance.""



Sena MP Sanjay Raut declined to comment on the tie-up. The BJP leadership has of late expressed optimism that the alliance is on course.

The former BJP minister said one of the Sena’s conditions for the alliance may be the appointment of a chief minister from its fold after the state assembly election irrespective of its seat numbers. “I am told that the Shiv Sena has asked the BJP leadership to accept the Karnataka formula in Maharashtra,” the former minister said. “In Karnataka, while the Congress secured more seats, still it accepted the leadership of the Janata Dal.”

NCP spokesman Nawab Malik said the recent debacle of BJP in the Hindi heartland was a pointer. “Whether there is an alliance between the BJP and the Shiv Sena or not, we are sure the Congress-NCP combine will secure 38 seats, while the Shiv-Sena-BJP combine will secure 10 seats,” he said. State Congress chief Ashok Chavan endorsed the view. “There is no Modi wave; I’m sure it’ll be the best performance by the Congress-NCP,” he said.

Laxman's 281 is the greatest innings played by an Indian cricketer: Dravid 

","
BENGALURU: Rahul Dravid had the ""best seat"" in the house when VVS Laxman scored his epic 281 against Australia at the Eden Gardens, an innings that the former captain termed as the ""greatest innings by an Indian"".


""Without a doubt, I think, the 281 was probably one of the most significant and greatest innings played by an Indian cricketer, in terms of the context, the consequence, the innings was played in,"" Dravid said at the launch of Laxman's autobiography ""281 and Beyond"" late Thursday evening.

""I really had the best seat in the house for the greatest Indian innings ever played,"" he added.

Dravid also lavished praise at his stroke-making capabilities during the epic knock.

""I was still imagining him and visualising him, stepping outside the leg-stump and hitting Shane Warne through the covers, for a ball that is pitched yards outside the legs-stump. Or to be able to flick a ball on the middle and off-stump on a turning track in Kolkata, across the line, against a great bowler like Shane Warne,"" he said.

""Or driving Glenn McGrath or Jason Gillespie. The way he did it, I think, for me, it was an incredible experience, watching him bat,"" he added.

Dravid also said he does not like watching lot of cricket but when he enjoyed Laxman's 281 runs innings, sitting in his house.

""It was absolutely phenomenal to watch. Sometimes, I don't like watching a lot of cricket. I really hate watching myself bat again when sometimes they show these old matches. If I am playing in that, I actually change the channel,"" he said.

Dravid, who smashed 180 and stitched 376-run partnership for fifth wicket with Laxman, said he was not in greatest of form, but he gained confidence after watching Laxman bat, who was already in the 90s.

""To be honest, I was not in the greatest of form leading into that particular innings. By the time, I went into bat (at No 6), Laxman was batting at 90-odd. I was not playing well in that series and watching him play gave me a lot of confidence. It was a magical day,"" he said.

""I am truly grateful and blessed to have had that opportunity and to have experienced that, with someone who I knew when I was a kid. In lot of ways, it (281) defines Laxman more than me.""

Laxman said both he and Dravid played according to the merit of the balls and hardly conversed, but punched each others gloves to stay on the wicket.

""It was a terrible situation for all of us to be in. We were thinking of the present. We are 274 runs behind (after following on). All we did was, playing according to the merit of the ball.

""And we did not have too much of conversation. All we did was punch the gloves and said 'one more over'. We broke it down into small goals,"" Laxman said.

Asked about the conversation they both had in the middle of the pitch, Dravid said he was keen on striking a conversation with Laxman, but was busy marking lines round the batting crease.

""He had so many of his routines, like, he will tap the gloves, then he will go to the crease, mark seven times this side and six times the other side.

""Then Laxman will come and stand. He was in such a rush to do all his lines that there was no time to have a conversation. I am waiting there to talk to Laxman and he is busy marking lines. I always used to pull his leg about it,"" Dravid recollected.

Gundappa Viswanath, Roger Binny, EAS Prasanna, Syed Kirmani, Javagal Srinath, Anil Kumble, Dodda Ganesh, Robin Uthappa and several other former cricketers, graced the occasion.

Elon Musk unveils underground tunnels, offers rides to VIPs - Times of India

LOS ANGELES: Elon Musk unveiled his underground transportation tunnel on Tuesday, allowing reporters and invited guests to take some of the first rides in the revolutionary albeit bumpy subterranean tube, the tech entrepreneur's answer to what he calls ""soul-destroying traffic.""

Guests boarded Musk's Tesla Model S and rode along Los Angeles-area surface streets about a mile away to what's known as O'Leary Station. The station, smack dab in the middle of a residential neighborhood, ""basically in someone's backyard,"" Musk says consists of a wall-less elevator that slowly took the car down a wide shaft, roughly 30 feet (9 meters) below the surface.



The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator a… https://t.co/2p4rmTnYt9— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) 1545190334000

The sky slowly fell away and the surprisingly narrow tunnel emerged.
""We're clear,"" said the driver, who sped up and zipped into the tunnel when a red track light turned green, making the tube look like something from space or a dance club.

The car jostled significantly during the ride, which was bumpy enough to give one reporter motion sickness while another yelled, ""Woo!""

Musk described his first ride as ""epic.""

""For me it was a eureka moment,"" he told a room full of reporters. ""I was like, this thing is going to damn well work.""

He said the rides are bumpy now because ""we kind of ran out of time"" and there were some problems with the speed of his paving machine.

""It'll be smooth as glass,"" he said of future systems. ""This is just a prototype. That's why it's a little rough around the edges.""



All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians & cyclists— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) 1545189714000

The demo rides were also considerably slower 40 mph (64 kph) than what Musk says the future system will run at: 150 mph (241 kph). Still, it took only three minutes to go just over a mile from the beginning to the end of the tunnel, the same amount of time it took to accomplish a right-hand turn out of the parking lot and onto a surface street even before the height of Los Angeles' notorious rush-hour traffic.



Capable of traveling safely at over 150mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) 1545189604000

The tunnel is just a test to prove the technology works and could one day cure traffic.

Tuesday's reveal comes almost two years to the day since Musk announced on Twitter that ""traffic is driving me nuts"" and he was ""going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging.""

""I am actually going to do this,"" he added in response to initial skepticism, a tweet that was blown up and posted near the entrance to the tunnel for Tuesday's event, along with other Musk tweets like, ""Defeating traffic is the ultimate boss battle.""



Defeating traffic is the ultimate boss battle— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) 1534391381000

The tweets were a nod to Musk's sense of humor. Just after announcing he was creating a tunnel, he began The Boring Company, tongue in cheek intentional. Since his announcement, Musk has only revealed a handful of photos and videos of the tunnel's progress.

On Tuesday, he explained for the first time in minute detail just how the system, which he simply calls ""loop,"" could work on a larger scale beneath cities across the globe. Autonomous, electric vehicles could be lowered into the system on wall-less elevators the size of two cars. Such elevators could be placed almost anywhere cars can go.

A number of autonomous cars would remain inside the system just for pedestrians and bicyclists. Once on the main arteries of the system, every car could run at top speed except when entering and exiting.

""It's much more like an underground highway than it is a subway,"" he said. ""It's not like you're going through a whole series of stops. Nope, the main arteries will be going super fast, and it's only when you want to get off the loop system that you slow down.""



This can be applied to any autonomous, electric vehicle, not just Tesla— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) 1545189240000

Musk said he scrapped his previous plan to run the cars on platforms called skates. Instead, the cars would have to be fitted with specially designed side wheels that pop out perpendicular to the car's regular tires and run along the tunnel's track. The cost for such wheels would be about $200 or $300 a car, Musk said.

He said tunnels are the safest place to be in earthquakes sort of like a submarine during a hurricane is safest beneath the surface and addressed other concerns such as the noise and disruption of building the tunnels, which he completely dismissed. When workers bored through the end of the test tunnel, for instance, the people in the home 20 feet (6 meters) away ""didn't even stop watching TV.""

""The footsteps of someone walking past your house will be more noticeable than a tunnel being dug under your house,"" he said,

Musk said it took about $10 million to build the test tunnel, a far cry from the $1 billion per mile his company says most tunnels take to build.

Musk explained just how he's cutting costs. Measures include improving the speed of construction with smarter tools, eliminating middlemen, building more powerful boring machines, and instead of hauling out all the dirt being excavated, Musk is turning them into bricks and selling them for 10 cents.

He reiterated the simplicity of all his ideas.

""No Nobel Prize is needed here,"" he said. ""It's very simple.""

And he's not doing it for the money, he said, adding that it's for the greater good.

""Traffic is a blight on everyone's life in all cities,"" he said. ""I really think this is incredibly profound. Hopefully that is coming across.""

Steve Davis, head of The Boring Company, said the interest in the tunnel systems has been significant anywhere from five to 20 calls a week from various municipalities and stakeholders.

One project Musk is planning on, known as the Dugout Loop, would take Los Angeles baseball fans to Dodger Stadium from one of three subway stations. Another would take travelers from downtown Chicago to O'Hare International Airport. Both projects are in the environmental review phase.

The Boring Company canceled its plans for another test tunnel on Los Angeles' west side last month after a neighborhood coalition filed a lawsuit expressing concerns about traffic and disruptions from trucks hauling out dirt during the boring process.

For the privately funded test tunnel, Musk acquired a tunnel-boring machine that had been used in a San Francisco Bay Area project and put it down a shaft in a parking lot at the SpaceX headquarters.

Already on Tuesday, Musk's representatives unveiled a new tunnel-boring machine they say they hope to have online soon, one that can bore four times faster than the one they've been using.

Musk's vision for the underground tunnels is not the same as another of his transportation concepts known as hyperloop. That would involve a network of nearly airless tubes that would speed special capsules over long distances at up to 750 mph (1,200 kph), using a thin cushion of air, magnetism and solar power.

The loop system is designed for shorter routes that wouldn't require the elimination of air friction, according to The Boring Company.

India vs Australia: Michael Hussey advises India to consider playing Hardik Pandya in Melbourne Test 

","
MELBOURNE: Former Australia batsman Michael Hussey Friday said that conditions for the third Test in Melbourne will be a lot different from those in Perth and India should consider drafting in all-rounder Hardik Pandya to bring balance to their attack.


The third Test begins in Melbourne on December 26 and the MCG pitch has come under sharp focus after it hosted a drab draw against England during last year's Ashes and the ground received a warning from the ICC.

""Conditions in Perth were quite unique and in Melbourne conditions will be totally different. I thought the Indian fast bowling unit has bowled beautifully in this series. They bowled a lot of overs in Adelaide and Perth in hot conditions, but had to work hard (for Australian wickets).""

""He (Pandya) is a bit like Mitchell Marsh, when he is in form. You get an extra bowling option that can take a little load away from the pacers particularly as the four-match series wears on. So this (bowling all-rounder) is something for both sides to look at,"" Hussey said.

Hussey said bowlers of both sides have really worked hard so far in this series and a lot will depend on how the two attacks recover.

India used a four-bowler attack in both the Adelaide and Perth Tests. While they won the first Test by 31 runs with a well-balanced bowling unit, including a spinner, the four-pacer plan backfired in Perth as Australia levelled the series with a 146-run win.

Hussey said that India missed Ravichandran Ashwin in Perth while Nathan Lyon bowled his side to victory, but also added that the four-pacer strategy was not totally wrong given the state of the pitch pre-match. Instead, he credited Australia for making good use of best batting conditions on day one.

""Looking at the conditions, you cannot really say anything against it (four pacers). At the start, you just thought there was plenty in it for the pacers and there were lots of cracks. I just think it was a good toss to win and in the first innings, on day one, the pitch played at its best and enabled Australia to get a decent first innings score. Then, we saw that the score came down as the match went on.

""So it was not necessarily what India did wrong. It was just good quality Test cricket in difficult conditions. India certainly missed Ashwin (as the game went on) and this is something for them to look into. Lyon is a quality bowler and he bowled from one end, allowing Tim Paine to rotate his pacers from the other end. India could have done that as well,"" Hussey said.

The 43-year-old Hussey, who played 79 Tests between 2005 and 2013 with 6235 runs to his kitty, also said that Indian batting was imbalanced with too many tail-enders, and the poor form of their openers was starting to show in contrast with what the Australian openers were able to achieve.

He said if the if poor starts of the openers continue, then Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane need to take on more responsibility to balance the reliance on Virat Kohli.

""Day one was the easiest time to bat but the Australian openers did a great job. And they were under pressure as well. Certainly with Aaron Finch, there was a lot of talk whether he should be opening and I thought he played brilliantly. Australia getting off to that 100-run opening partnership certainly did put them in the box seat and a strong position to win the game.

""Both the Indian openers are fine players, but they are obviously not getting going. Sometimes it happens and things are not just going your way,"" he said.

Asked if India were relying too much on the performance of Kohli, Hussey said, ""Kohli is the best player in the world, so India do rely on him and that is not wrong. For Australia, when Steve Smith and David Warner were playing, there was a heavy reliance (on them).

""For India, Pujara was outstanding in Adelaide, and Rahane is looking good in patches. You always rely on your best batsmen, but in this second Test, with that extra fast bowler the Indian tail was too long and it upset the batting balance,"" he said.

Sea level projected to rise by 3.5 to 34.6 inches between 1990 and 2100: Union Minister 

","
NEW DELHI: Sea level is projected to rise by 3.5 to 34.6 inches between 1990 and 2100 leading to inundation of valuable land, India has told a UN body, while stating regions in the country's western coast including Khambat and Kutch in Gujarat and Mumbai are among the most ""vulnerable"" areas. Minister of state for environment Mahesh Sharma, in a written reply in Lok Sabha, said the deltas of the Ganga, Krishna, Godavari, Cauvery, and Mahanadi on the east coast may be threatened due to this rise in sea level. 


 ""Sea levels are changing at different rates along the Indian coast as per the studies carried out by the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services. 

 ""The Second National Communication submitted by India to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change projects sea level rise by 3.5 to 34.6 inches between 1990 and 2100, which may result in saline coastal groundwater, endangering wetlands and inundating valuable land and coastal communities"" Sharma said. 

 He was asked whether rise in sea level owing to global warming was posing a threat to the coastal villages of the country. 

 ""The most vulnerable stretches along the western Indian coast are Khambat and Kutch in Gujarat, Mumbai, and parts of the Konkan coast and south Kerala. The deltas of the Ganga, Krishna, Godavari, Cauvery, and Mahanadi on the East Coast may be threatened, along with irrigated land and a number of urban and other settlements that are situated in them,"" Sharma said. 

 He asserted that the government is committed to take proactive steps for protecting country's coastal areas and communities. 

 He said the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification, 2011 and Island Protection Zone (IPZ) Notification, 2011 are enforced and implemented by the concerned Coastal Zone Management Authorities (CZMAs) of states and UTs. 

 Under the extant regulations, theses CZMAs have been empowered to enquire into the cases of alleged violation of the provisions of the notifications and take appropriate action under the law. 

 ""As per State of Forest Report 2017, there has been a net increase of 181 sqkm in the mangrove cover of the country as compared to 2015 assessment,"" he said. 

 The other steps taken by the government target protection of livelihoods of fisher folk communities, preservation of coastal ecology, initiation of an integrated coastal zone management project with objectives of building capacity for implementation of comprehensive coastal management, delineation of erosion line over the entire coast line covering the mainland coastal states/UTs as a part of hazard line mapping exercise carried out by Survey of India among others.

Sajjan Kumar: Delhi HC dismisses Sajjan Kumar's plea for extension of time to surrender 

","
NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Friday dismissed Sajjan Kumar's plea seeking an extension of time to surrender in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case, saying it found no ground for granting the relief.


The former Congress leader had on December 20 ( Thursday) 

  sought time from the court till January 30
 + to surrender after being recently sentenced to life imprisonment, saying he had to settle family affairs, including those related to property. The convicted ex-member of parliament is married and has three children and eight grandchildren.

The high court had earlier this week directed the 73-year-old to surrender before authorities by December 31 after holding him guilty.




Sajjan Kumar convicted in 1984 anti-Sikh riots case: What the Delhi HC said in its verdictThe Delhi high court on Monday sentenced Congress leader Sajjan Kumar to life in the first conviction of a politician in the deadly anti-Sikh riots in 1984, holding it was perpetrated by those with ""political patronage"" and pushed for a new law for speedy prosecution of genocide and mass killings.


""The applicant is at present under shock and surprise in view of the order of acquittal being set aside and him being convicted, although the applicant believes he in innocent,"" the plea stated.

In his plea, Kumar also said he wants to approach the Supreme Court through a senior lawyer, but as the apex court is on vacation, most senior advocates are on holiday.

“The applicant is the best person to brief his counsel and inform them about the facts. The applicant prays that he be granted further extension of 30 days so as to enable him to settle his family affairs to meet his close relatives, near and dear ones including friends who have been associated with him over a period of 73 years,” it said.

The Delhi high court convicted and awarded life term “till the remainder of his life” to Kumar in a case relating to the killing of five Sikhs in Raj Nagar part-I in Palam Colony in southwest Delhi on November 1-2, 1984, and burning down of a gurdwara in Raj Nagar part II during that period.

The riots had broken out after the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984 by her two Sikh bodyguards.

Govt has launched national plan for conservation of migratory birds: Minister 

","
NEW DELHI: The government has launched a national action plan for conservation of migratory birds along the Central Asian Flyway which emphasizes on coordinated efforts by all relevant stakeholders in conservation of the winged species, the Lok Sabha was told Friday. Minister of State for Environment Mahesh Sharma said the plan has been developed to ensure healthy populations of the migratory species in India. 


Replying to another question, he said studies have indicated that some migratory bird were showing a decreasing trend. 

According to reports, the Central Asian Flyway (CAF) covers a large continental area of Eurasia between the Arctic and Indian Oceans and the associated island chains. 

The flyway comprises several important migration routes of waterbirds, most of which extend from the northernmost breeding grounds in the Russian Federation (Siberia) to the southernmost non-breeding (wintering) grounds in west and south Asia, the Maldives and the British Indian Ocean Territory. 

""The Environment Ministry has launched the 'National Action Plan for conservation of migratory birds along the Central Asian Flyway'. The Action Plan emphasizes on coordinated efforts of all relevant stakeholders in conservation of migratory birds,"" Sharma said. 

India provides a critical stopover as well as a wintering habitat to more than 370 species of migratory birds, he said, adding that the action plan has been prepared for a period of five years. 

The 20 species of migratory birds which have been prioritised under the National Central Asian Flyway Action Plan include the Eurasian Curlew, Crab Plover, Black-tailed Godwit, Bar-tailed Godwit and the Red Knot, among others, Sharma said. 

Replying to another question, the minister said migratory species were omnipotent in nature and were found in protected as well as non-protected areas, both urban and rural. 

The winter visitors arrive in India by October and stay till March or April. The summer migrants start coming from mid-March and stay till August. 

""Although there is no specific assessment conducted by the ministry with respect to population of migratory birds visiting India recently, assessments by Wetlands International in the past indicated that some migratory bird showed a decreasing trend, whereas some species indicated a stable population,"" he said.

Sushma Swaraj meets Chinese counterpart in Delhi, discussion held under 'new framework' 

","
NEW DELHI: In yet another step towards improving ties, external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi Friday held extensive talks under a newly established framework to enhance cultural and people-to-people exchanges between the two nations.


The Chinese foreign minister arrived here early Friday on a four-day visit primarily to attend the first meeting of the new mechanism which was agreed to in the informal summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping in Wuhan in April.

In his written message, Modi expressed happiness over talks between the two sides under the 'High Level Mechanism on Cultural and People-to-People Exchanges, which was pushed by him during the Wuhan summit.

He also hoped that the new mechanism will help in further deepening cultural exchanges and engagement between people of the two countries.

""Age old links have been reinforced with increased contacts & exchanges between our peoples in contemporary times,"" Modi said.

External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said the new mechanism is aimed at building synergies in people-to-people ties.

In a tweet, he said the two sides discussed ways to enhance cooperation in tourism, art, films, media, culture, yoga, sports, academic and youth exchanges.

After the over two-month face-off between their militaries at the Doklam tri-junction last year, the two countries have been initiating series of measures to reset ties.

Last month, Modi and Xi had met on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Argentina during which they concurred that there had been a ""perceptible improvement"" in bilateral ties after their Wuhan summit and both sides are optimistic that 2019 would be an even better year for India-China relations.

They also discussed joint efforts to further enhance mutual trust and friendship between the two neighbours.

Earlier this month, foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale held talks here with Chinese vice foreign minister Kong Xuanyou and reviewed the progress made in the bilateral ties since the Wuhan summit.

In their informal summit in the Chinese city of Wuhan in April, Modi and Xi decided to issue ""strategic guidance"" to their militaries to strengthen communications so that they can build trust and understanding.

The informal summit had taken place seven months after the Doklam standoff.

Troops of India and China were locked in a 73-day face-off in Doklam from June 16 last year after the Indian side stopped the building of a road in the disputed area by the Chinese Army. The impasse ended on August 28.

BJP goading officers to make political remarks: Congress 

","
Hours after accusing IAF chief B S Dhanoa of lying on the Rafale deal, former oil minister M Veerappa Moily partially retracted his statement. 

 Speaking to the media in Hyderabad, Moily had initially said the IAF chief was ""suppressing the truth"", Moily claimed that Dhanoa, along with Rafale manufacturers, had visited Indian defence public sector HAL headquarters days before India and France announced in Paris that there will be an inter-governmental agreement and found the PSU a ""competent body with necessary expertise"". 

The comment alluded to Congress's allegation that the government ousted HAL from the Rafale deal to give the offset contracts to Anil Ambani's firm as ""cronyism"".

 Later, referring to the IAF chief, Moily said, ""The question is, is he justifying it on the basis of the Supreme Court judgment which is flawed? In the light of this, whether the IAF chief can again certify that this is fine. I am asking him that question. I never called him a liar. If this HAL is fine... Both of them cannot be fine."" 

 The government has said that the deal, as under negotiation during the UPA tenure, failed to resolve differences between HAL and manufacturer Dassault over the man-hours needed for maintenance, significantly impacting pricing. 

 In a statement, Dhanoa on Wednesday backed the apex court judgment which recently cleared the Rafale deal challenged before it and slammed the criticism as political. tnn

Over 20,000 bicyclists died in road crashes; one tiny fix could have saved them 

","
NEW DELHI: If Faridabad-based PP Singh has his way, bicycles wouldn’t be out on roads without retro reflective tape affixed on them. Singh sees it as an effective tool on bicycles that can help motorists identify them and prevent a crash from taking place. 


It all started when he had a narrow escape with an accident on a foggy winter night six years ago. “It was coming back from my work. The bicycle in front of me not only lacked illumination but was also black in colour, making it completely impossible for me to spot it,” says Singh, an IT manager and founder of the NGO, ‘I love my city’.


The incident shook Singh. The following day, he started counting the bicycles with reflectors on his way to work and back. He continued the exercise for a month and was shocked to find that a whopping 80 per cent cycles on roads did not have reflectors. Since then, he and his NGO team have fixed reflective tapes on more than 1 lakh bicycles in and around Faridabad. 


Bicyclists are one of the most vulnerable road users in the country. According to data by ministry of road transport and highways, bicyclists’ fatalities surged by a whopping 37.7 per cent in 2017. In fact, in the six years between 2012 and 2017, as many as 24,755 bicyclists lost their lives in road crashes.





Passionate about his cause, Singh followed it up with a letter to the WHO suggesting reflective tapes as a long-lasting solution for safety of bicycles. The effectiveness of retro reflective tapes was also recognised by Union minister for transport and highways, Nitin Gadkari who wrote a letter regarding the same to the minister for consumer affairs, food and public distribution, Ram Vilas Paswan in 2014. Sadly, the idea hasn’t yet picked up.




PP Singh affixing retro reflective tape on cycles and rickshaws 


POOR VISIBILITY, THE KEY REASON BEHIND CRASHES

One of the major reasons for crashes involving cyclists is poor visibility. To ensure bicycles remain conspicuous to other road users, especially in the dark, many cycles have a reflector on the rear mudguard. Sadly, the safety tool on the bicycle has never been taken seriously by the riders. “A damaged reflector doesn’t hamper the movement of a cycle, so it not replaced by most cyclists. Even an educated bicyclist doesn’t appreciate its utility and bother replacing it,” adds Singh. 


PRESENT REGULATIONS 
In 2015, the Supreme Court committee on road safety mandated a set of 10 reflectors conforming to ISO 6742-2 standards on different spots on bicycles. The good news is that cycle manufacturers have begun complying with it. Says Abhishek Munjal, director, Hero Cycles, “A set of 10 reflectors are installed across all ranges since 2016 as cyclist safety is of paramount importance for us.”

However, road safety experts aren’t happy. “BIS recommends equipping bicycles with retro-reflective tapes too. This is very much-needed as reflectors aren't that effective,"" says KK Kapila, chairman, International Road Federation.



 A cycle with a retro reflective tape
In India, bicycles are the most popular transport for commuting to work. A whopping 13 per cent or 2.62 crore Indians cycle to work, according to Census 2011. 





Retro reflective tape is a simple and effective solution for a vast chunk of population riding old bicycles. It comes with many benefits:

One, unlike reflectors, retro reflective tape is not susceptible to breaking and therefore does not need replacement. 

Two, it offers good visibility. A bicycle with a retro reflective tape is easily visible from 100-200 meters, a good enough distance to be spotted by a motorist. However, for increasing the conspicuity of bicycle, BIS recommends tapes at specific locations on bicycles. It also specifies the colours and sizes for each of these locations. “The brand one buys should conform to BIS specifications. The one that I experimented with, on a patch of road, washed away with just one rain but another one survived extreme weather conditions, has a good hold and even after six years is intact on all bicycles,” says Singh.


Three, it is cost-effective. A high intensity reflective sticker of size measuring 2’’x 2” costs anywhere around Rs 12-15 against Rs 25-30 for a reflector. Also, reflective tapes are now available in smaller sizes, taking away the pain of buying a complete roll of tape and cutting it proportionately. 


With India just two years away from meeting its target of reducing road crashes and fatalities by 50 per cent, solutions like retro reflective tapes can go a long way in making roads safer. What it needs is a concerted last mile effort that will make reflective tape easily accessible to cyclists.

Maharashtra Snooping row: Govt defends order allowing 10 central agencies to monitor, decrypt 'any' computers, opposition slams move 

","
NEW DELHI: The government on Friday defended its recent order to authorise 10 central agencies

  to intercept ""any information"" on computers
 + , saying the authorisation was given under old rules. The opposition was, however, up in arms over the issue.




Responding to Congress leader Anand Sharma's charge in the Rajya Sabha, finance minister Arun Jaitley said it would have been better if the opposition had obtained all the information before raising the issue. ""On December 20, same order of authorisation was repeated that was existing since 2009. You are make a mountain where a molehill does not exist,"" Jaitley said.

""When senior members from opposition raise an issue every word spoken by them has precious value and therefore they must know facts,"" Jaitley told the House.

He said the rules under which agencies have been authorised to intercept were framed in 2009 when the Congress-led UPA government was in power. The authorisation has been issued under the same rules. Since the Act has been in place these orders of authorisation are repeated from time to time, he stated.

The order issued late on Thursday night authorises 10 agencies such as the Intelligence Bureau, Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate to intercept, monitor, and decrypt “any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer resource under the said Act (section 69 of the IT Act, 2000).” The order was passed by the 'cyber and information security' division of the Union home ministry under the authority of home secretary Rajiv Gauba.

According to the order, the subscriber or service provider or any person in charge of the computer resource will be bound to extend all facilities and technical assistance to the agencies. Failing to do so will invite seven-year imprisonment and fine.


OPPOSITION CALLS ORDER 'UNCONSITUTIONAL'
The opposition has called the order 'unconstitutional, undemocratic and an assault on fundamental rights'. Parties including the CPM, Samajwadi Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Trinamool Congress said they would collectively oppose the home ministry's order, adding that the BJP government was converting the country into a surveillance state.

""From Modi Sarkar to stalker sarkar, clearly the string of losses has left the BJP government desperate for information,"" the Congress said on its official Twitter handle.



The Congress president alleged that the government is trying to convert the country into a ""police state"".



But the government was quick to hit back.

BJP president Amit Shah immediately hit back at Rahul's barb. In a series of tweets, he accused the Congress president of ""fear mongering"" and playing politics with national security.


Yet again Rahul does fear-mongering and plays politics with national security. UPA put no barriers on unlawful sur… https://t.co/ceZVeJIjUd— Amit Shah (@AmitShah) 1545398506000

Section 69 of the IT Act deals with the ""power to issue directions for interception or monitoring or decryption of any information through any computer resource"". It provides that the central government or a state government or any of its officers can direct any agency to intercept or decrypt any information for the purpose of national security.

According to the government, the recent notification does not confer any new powers. Adequate provisions are provided in the IT Act 2000. Similar provisions and procedures already exist in the Telegraph Act along with identical safeguards. The present notification is analogous to the authorisation issued under the Telegraph Act. The entire process is also subject to a robust review mechanism as in case of the Telegraph Act.

In 2009, the UPA government had brought the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption of Information) Rules, 2009 to define the procedure and safeguards for such interception. 

According to these rules, ‘no person shall carry out the interception or decryption of any information except by an order issued by the competent authority’. It also states that‘the competent authority may authorise an agency of the government to intercept or decrypt information.

However, although the UPA government made it compulsory that only authorised agencies can carry out surveillance, it did not specifically name the authorised agencies, which left the ruling open to misuse for unlawful and illegal surveillance.

In its recent order, the present Modi government has made the ruling more specific - authorising 10 agencies for the purpose of surveillance for national security -- the Intelligence Bureau, Narcotics Control Bureau, Enforcement Directorate, Central Board of Direct Taxes, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Central Bureau of Investigation, National Investigation Agency, Cabinet Secretariat (R&AW), Directorate of Signal Intelligence (For service areas of Jammu & Kashmir, North-East and Assam only) and Commissioner of Police, Delhi.

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said this will ensure that any interception, monitoring or decryption of any information through any computer resource is done as according to the law. Every individual case will continue to require prior approval of the home ministry or the state government, the MHA stated, also clarifying that it has not delegated its powers to any law enforcement or security.

Veerappa Moily: Moily accuses IAF chief of lying, retracts after furore 

","
NEW DELHI: Senior Congress functionary and former oil minister M Veerappa Moily triggered a fresh controversy over the Rafale deal on Thursday when he accused IAF chief B S Dhanoa of “lying” after the Air Force commander hailed the Supreme Court order upholding the defence deal. After his remarks triggered a furore, Moily said he had never called the officer a liar. 


The chief of air staff had said that the SC had delivered a “fine judgment” and warned against politicisation of defence purchases, pointing to the delays in acquisition that followed the Bofors howitzer scandal. Reacting to the IAF chief ’s remarks, Moily lashed out, saying: “Today, to say it is fine (the SC judgement)... I think that IAF chief is not fine... he is not fine, he is lying. He is suppressing the truth. He is a party to suppressing the truth.” 

The Congress leader’s comments reflected the ire in the party over several senior IAF officers vouching for the suitability of Rafale and also backing the selection process. Congress backed Moily, saying the government is using service chiefs for political warfare. Moily’s statement predictably set off a row between BJP and Congress. 

“Veerappa Moily of Congress just now called the IAF chief ‘a LIAR’ all because he said that India needs Rafale jets! Till now they have called the SC, the government, French government and president and Dassault CEO liars,” tweeted Amit Malviya, head of BJP’s IT cell.

Public sector banks go on strike: Only one day to get bank tasks done between Dec 21-26 

","
NEW DELHI: Public sector banks will be open only for a day between December 21 to December 26, due to a strike called by the union on Friday. During the strike, Monday is the only day customers will be able to get their tasks done at public sector banks until the strike ends on Wednesday. Private sector banks will not be participating in the strike.


The bank officers called the strike to demand immediate wage revision and to protest merger of the state-owned banks.

The strike call given by the All India Bank Officers' Confederation (AIBOC) expected to hit banking operations across the country. However, private sector banks would continue their usual business as they are not part of the strike.

Most of the banks have already informed their customers about the strike and its impact on their normal banking operation.

The United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), an umbrella body of the top nine bank unions, has also decided to observe a strike on December 26.

Taking into account these two days of unions' strike and other holidays, banks would be closed for most of the extended Christmas weekend. So, most bank branches will be open only for a day between this Friday and next Wednesday. Till December 26, there are three holidays -- fourth Saturday on December 22, then Sunday and then Christmas on Tuesday.

AIBOC joint general secretary Ravinder Gupta said, ""We have demanded wage revision based on the minimum wages formula without linking to profits or paying capacity.""

Besides, the union has also opposed the proposed merger Bank of Baroda, Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank.

As of now many major banks have not given the mandate, few banks have given mandate to IBA for negotiating only upto Scale III officers, said Charanjit deputy general secretary Canara Bank Officers' Association, an affiliate of AIBOC said.

Such fractured mandate will be resulting in deep cut of allocated funds meant for distributing among the various heads of pay slip components, Gupta said.

As the allocated funds would be the agreed percentage of total pay slip components of up to scale III in respect of those banks which have given mandate and not the pay slip components of the entire industry of all the cadres including workmen, he added. 


Bank schedule

Friday (Dec 21): Public sector banks to stay close due to the strike called by AIBOC


Saturday (Dec 22): Fourth Saturday off


Sunday (Dec 23): Weekly off


Monday (Dec 24): All banks to remain open


Tuesday (Dec 25): Christmas holiday


Wednesday (Dec26): Public sector banks to continue strike

J&J's baby shampoo and soap too come under lens 

","
NEW DELHI: Tightening its noose on Johnson & Johnson, the country’s drug regulator on Thursday expanded the scope of its investigation to cover the company’s iconic brands of shampoo and baby soap, apart from powder which is already under the scanner for alleged presence of cancer-causing asbestos. The regulator also ordered J&J’s Mumbai factory to immediately stop using the available raw material to produce talc, a top official told TOI. 


A similar order was issued to the company's plant in Baddi (Himachal Pradesh) on Wednesday. Initial findings of the investigation showed that J&J was “not complying with testing norms” for raw material as per mandated under Drugs & Cosmetics Rules, the official said. 

“As per norms, the company is supposed to test each batch of raw material for all specifications, including for presence of asbestos. During the probe, inspectors found the company was not testing every batch but only randomly checking some batches,” the official said, adding it would take action against the company once the inspections were over. 

J&J did not respond till the time of going to press. TOI had first reported on Wednesday that J&J’s factories, distributors and wholesalers making or selling any brand of its body powder — for both children and adults — across the country would be raided by the central drug regulator. While inspections are on at the American pharmaceutical company’s facilities across the country, the regulator has issued prohibitory orders to two plants so far — Baddi and Mumbai. 

According to the regulator, drug inspectors found around 200 tonnes of talc raw material stored in the Mumbai factory, which the company has been prohibited from using till further orders from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI). In Baddi, the plant had around 80 tonnes of talc stored during the inspection. Samples of the raw material were collected and sent for testing. 

Talc has come under the scanner in the US for allegedly containing cancer-causing asbestos. The collected samples will be tested primarily on three parameters — compliance with regulatory and manufacturing standards, for presence of asbestos in any brand of its powder and raw material used, and whether J&J’s products comply with the cosmetics standards in India, the official said. 

In July, a Missouri court had ordered J&J to pay $4.7 billion as compensation and damages to 22 women in the US who claimed asbestos in its talc had caused them ovarian cancer.

China FM lands in India today, track II on menu 

","
BEIJING: China’s state councilor and foreign minister Wang Yi is expected to arrive on Friday in New Delhi on a two-day visit during which he will co-chair a meeting on developing people-to-people relations between the two countries.


The government recently invited Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, to start 5G trails in India. Huawei is desperately seeking new markets at a time it faces stiff resistance in the Western world over allegations that it poses security risks.

The Indian move amounts to extending a hand of friendship at a crucial time when the US and Chinese governments are engaged in a bitter quarrel over the recent detention of a top Huawei official in Canada at the instance of the US. The official was later released on bail but has not yet been cleared of the charge of selling components to Iran in defiance of a US ban.

But China is unlikely to be satisfied with the Huawei gesture and New Delhi’s decision to relax visa rules for Chinese who visit India to attend conferences and wants India to accept its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). New Delhi is opposed to it because one stretch of the BRI passes through disputed Pakistanoccupied Kashmir. But China has stepped up efforts to persuade Myanmar and Nepal to implement the programme and build indirect pressure on India to accept it.

Besides meeting external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and possibly PM Narendra Modi, Wang will attend an India-China Film Festival in New Delhi on Friday . The effort is to leave behind the shadow of the 73-day Doklam border dispute which ended in August 2017.

Efforts to build people-topeople relationships picked up momentum after the informal summit between PM Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Wuhan last summer.

Opposition hits out at MHA order giving snooping powers to investigative agencies 

","
NEW DELHI: The opposition parties on Friday said the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) order authorising 10 Central agencies to intercept, monitor, and decrypt “any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer” is unconstitutional and against fundamental rights.


The Congress, the CPM, the Samajwadi Party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Trinamool Congress spoke out against the order, which they said was issued on Thursday.

Congress leader Anand Sharma said the order was against the right to privacy, which was a fundamental right.

""The government has done it by stealth and we collectively oppose it. This gives unlimited powers to all these agencies to monitor every information that interest them and complete surveillance which is unacceptable in democracy,"" he said.




Samajwadi Party's Ram Gopal Yadav termed the order unconstitutional and said the present government should refrain from making such moves with just a few month left for the general elections.

""This government has only a few months left and it should not dig potholes for itself as a new government will be installed in the centre soon,"" he said.

TMC's Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said the move was 'draconian while RJD's Manoj Jha said that it was a cause of concern for not just parliamentarians, but for every Indian.

CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury voiced his opposition on Twitter.

""Why is every Indian being treated like a criminal? This order by a govt wanting to snoop on every citizen is unconstitutional and in breach of the telephone tapping guidelines, the Privacy Judgement and the Aadhaar judgement,""he said.

Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram compared the order to a situation in an ""Orwellian state"".

""Not studied the matter, but if anybody is going to monitor computers then it is an Orwellian state,"" said Chidambaram.

According to the order, the subscriber or service provider or any person in charge of the computer resource will be bound to extend all facilities and technical assistance to the agencies. Failing to do so will invite seven-year imprisonment and fine.

The agencies are the Intelligence Bureau, Narcotics Control Bureau, Enforcement Directorate, Central Board of Direct Taxes, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Central Bureau of Investigation; National Investigation Agency, Cabinet Secretariat (R&AW), Directorate of Signal Intelligence (For service areas of Jammu & Kashmir, North-East and Assam only) and Commissioner of Police, Delhi.

No religion greater than other, creator is one: Farooq Abdullah 

","
KOLKATA: Expressing concern over the prevailing atmosphere of ""fear and hatred"" in the country, former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah on Friday said no religion was greater than the other.


Abdullah, while speaking at a programme here, said people must strive to build a country where all religions were equally revered.

""No religion is greater than the other. When I look into your eyes, I see my God, when you look into my eyes, you see your God. Because there is no difference. The creator is the same,"" the veteran politician said at the 11th edition of 'World Confluence of Humanity, Power and Spirituality' here.

The National Conference (NC) leader urged people to understand and respect people of other communities.

""Have we been able to build that India where we can survive together in happiness? No. We have created an India where there is fear and hatred... Please love each other and understand each other's pains,"" he said.

Observing that no one cared about religion during blood transfusion in hospitals, Abdullah said, ""Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians have the same blood flowing through their veins.""

He apprehended that a day might arrive when the oppressed class revolts against the politicians and privileged sections for not giving them their due.

""As a nation, we must try and remove class and communal disparities and treat our neighbours with kindness and love,"" he added.

LJP to contest on 6 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar; announcement on Saturday 

","
NEW DELHI: After some hard bargaining by the Lok Janshakti Party, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar is understood to have sealed a seat-sharing deal for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls with the BJP and the Janata Dal-United contesting an equal number of 17 seats each leaving the rest of the six seats to the party headed by Ram Vilas Paswan.


In a bid to retain the LJP in its fold, the BJP is also believed to have agreed to give a Rajya Sabha seat from its quota to the party.

The seat-sharing arrangement is likely to be made public on Saturday in the presence of BJP chief Amit Shah, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and LJP supremo Ram Vilas Paswan. 

The LJP national spokesperson Sanjay Saraf told IANS, ""It has been decided that our party would contest six Lok Sabha seats in Bihar and get one Rajya Sabha berth."" 

Earlier in the day, Union Minister Arun Jaitley held discussions with Ramvilas Paswan and his son Chirag Paswan over seat sharing arrangements in Bihar for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

The discussion came a day after LJP leaders met BJP President Amit Shah and shared their concerns over the delay in holding talks over the seat sharing issue.

After the meeting with Jaitley, LJP Parliamentary Board Chairman Chirag Paswan expressed the hope that talks would move in the right direction.

""Talks are going on. An announcement will be made at an appropriate time. We have put our points before the BJP leadership and the important thing is that we are being heard. Hope everything will be fine,"" he told reporters.

His uncle, Ram Chandra Paswan, who also attended the meeting said that the LJP would remain part of the NDA.

""We are and will remain in the NDA. Seat sharing will be announced this week,"" Ram Chandra Paswan said. 

""The party, which is having strongholds in any specific area, should be respected. We are a small party. We need adequate time for preparation. That's why we wanted the issue to be resolved at the earliest,"" he told reporters.

Sources in the BJP said a final arrangement of seats would be formalised after a meeting of the BJP and LJP leaders with Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who is in Delhi.

A Bharatiya Janata Party leader also claimed that talks were going in the right direction and everything will be finalised soon.

In the last Lok Sabha polls, the BJP had contested from 30 seats and won 22, while the LJP won six seats and lost one. The Rashtriya Lok Samta Party (RLSP), which is now a part of the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan (Grand Alliance) in Bihar, bagged three. 

In 2014, the Janata Dal-United (JD-U) had contested on its own but performed poorly. It had won only two seats.

On Thursday, BJP leader and Bihar in-charge Bhupendra Yadav first went to meet Chirag and Ram Vilas Paswan and the three leaders later went to the residence of Amit Shah. They were joined there by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.

The BJP and the Nitish Kumar-led JD-U had declared earlier that they would contest an equal number of seats in Bihar in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

British woman raped in Goa, TN native held 

","
MARGAO: A 30-year-old native of Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, a criminal wanted in the case of a Rs 32 lakh heist, was arrested on Thursday for the alleged sexual assault of a 48-year-old British woman in south Goa early the same day. 


 Police were already on the lookout for Ramachandrappa Chinna Yellappa for the robbery in north Goa beach belt of Morjim earlier in the week, when he raped a woman at Palolem, a popular beach destination in south Goa. 

The incident comes just about 19 months after the rape and murder of a 28-year-old British woman at Devbag beach in Canacona.

Police said Yellappa attacked the woman as she was returning to her room from Canacona railway station with her luggage. Yellappa accosted her on the road leading to Palolem, allegedly pushed her into a road- side field where he committed the crime around 4.30am, police said. 

 The woman, a frequent visitor to Goa for past 18 years, had gone to Canacona railway station to board a train to Thivim, from where she had other travel plans. But as the train was running late, she decided to return to her room. 

South Goa SP Arvind Gawas told TOI the survivor told police Yellappa gripped her neck as he assaulted her. He then fled with the three bags that contained Rs 20,000 in cash, mobile, passport, debit cards and other valuables, Canacona police inspector Rajendra Prabhudesai said. 

 ""CCTV footage clearly showed a person in a sweater with a hood moving about suspiciously-he was spotted near the site of the crime as well as at some other locations along this road stretch. All police stations were alerted, and soon enough a person matching the description of the suspect's appearance was reported to have been spotted in Margao. He was immediately nabbed,"" Gawas said. 

 It turned out to be Yellappa, also wanted for the Rs 32-lakh robbery.

India is Afghanistan's most reliable regional partner: Pentagon 

","
WASHINGTON: India is Afghanistan's most reliable regional partner, the Pentagon has said as it praised New Delhi's contributions to the peaceful development of the war-torn country.


The Pentagon, in its semi-annual Afghan report to the US Congress that covers the period of June to November 2018, said India interpreted the new US South Asia policy as an opportunity to increase its economic involvement with Afghanistan.

The South Asia Strategy, which was announced by President Donald Trump in August 2017, has focused on pressuring Pakistan to limit support and safe-haven for proxy terrorist and militant groups and to play a constructive role in facilitating Afghan reconciliation, the Pentagon said in the report.

Noting that the US strategy calls for a regional approach to enhance stability in South Asia, the report said this includes building a broad consensus for a stable Afghanistan, emphasising regional economic integration and cooperation, stressing cooperation for an Afghan-led peace process, and holding countries accountable for their use of proxies or other means to undermine stability and regional confidence.

""India is Afghanistan's most reliable regional partner and the largest contributor of development assistance in the region,"" said the Pentagon.

Since late 2015, India has pledged $1 billion in development assistance in addition to the approximate USD 2 billion already spent on Afghan infrastructure.

India continues to invest in the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) natural gas pipeline, it said.

""India provides significant training opportunities for Afghan officers and enlisted personnel and has frequently offered to increase its burden-sharing for Afghanistan. Approximately 130 Afghans travel to India each year to attend various military academy and commissioning programs,"" the Pentagon said.

2019 Lok Sabha polls: Ram Vilas Paswan holds talks with Jaitley over seat sharing in Bihar 

","
NEW DELHI: LJP president Ram Vilas Paswan on Friday met BJP leader Arun Jaitley amid indications that the two parties may soon arrive at a seat-sharing agreement in Bihar for the Lok Sabha polls.


Paswan's son Chirag, who has been vocal in airing his party's differences with the BJP, told reporters that talks were on and claimed there were other issues besides sharing of seats.

Another Lok Janshakti Party leader, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that talks have been positive and they were hopeful of an early solution.

""If all goes well, we will contest six of the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar,"" he said.

There is speculation that the regional party has also sought a Rajya Sabha berth.

If the LJP is given six seats, as many as it had won in 2014, then the BJP and its another ally Janata Dal (United), which is headed by Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, will contest 17 seats each.

BJP president Amit Shah had earlier announced that his party and the JD(U) will be contesting equal number of seats in the politically crucial state where the BJP-led NDA had won 31 seats in 2014.

The deployment of Jaitley, an old Bihar hand in the party with friendly relations with leaders of different parties, by the BJP to buy truce with the LJP underscores the importance the saffron party has attached to continuing its alliance with Paswan's party, which enjoys strong influence among Dalits.

Top BJP leaders, including its president Amit Shah and Jaitley, had held an hour-long meeting with LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan and his son Thursday to resolved their differences.

Chirag Paswan had earlier written a letter to Jaitley asking him to explain what benefits demonetisation brought to the country.

He had also tweeted that a delay in seat-sharing announcement may harm the ruling alliance.

Delhi HC grants AJL two-week time to vacate Herald House 

","
NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court on Friday dismissed the petition filed by Associated Journals Ltd(AJL), publisher of National Herald, challenging the eviction order of October 30. The court has given two weeks time to AJL to vacate the premises at ITO. 


The Centre in its eviction order had mentioned a violation of 56-year-old lease conditions by the publisher. 

Justice Sunil Gaur, who was hearing the matter, had reserved his decision on November 22 on AJL's plea against the government's October 30 notice.

The court on the last date had asked the Centre what was the justification to re-enter the premises now when publication of National Herald has commenced.

The Centre and the Land and Development Office (L&DO) had told the court that re-entry notice was issued as it had initiated the proceedings back in 2016 when no printing or publishing activity was going on.

All the procedures have been followed to the hilt before issuing the notice for re-entry to AJL, it had said.

AJL had opposed the Centre's stand, saying that publication of web editions began in 2016 and the issue of absence of printing press in the premises was not raised then.

It had said the government kept silent till April 2018 when it again sent a notice for inspection and in which it had said that it was coming to check breaches mentioned in notice of October 10, 2016.

BJP rath yatra Bengal: Calcutta high court puts BJP's rath yatra in West Bengal on hold for now 

","
KOLKATA: A division bench of the Calcutta high court on Friday quashed a single bench order that had allowed BJP's 'Rath Yatra' in West Bengal and asked it to hear the case afresh to consider intelligence inputs by state agencies.


The single-judge bench of Tapabrata Chakraborty was asked to dispose the matter expeditiously after considering whether there were adequate materials to arrive at the conclusion to allow the 'yatra' as proposed by the BJP.

The division bench said the order needs to consider afresh with the 36 intelligence inputs submitted by the state government before the single bench.

Advocate General Kishore Dutta, representing the state, said that the single bench had not considered the intelligence inputs submitted to it in a sealed cover and had returned it to him without even opening it.

He had submitted intelligence inputs from 31 police districts and five police commisionerates before the bench, which he said talked about apprehension of communal unrest if the BJP's proposed roadshows were allowed.

The 'Rath Yatra', which was originally scheduled to start on December 7 but was denied permission by the state government, has become the latest political flashpoint between the saffron party and the state's ruling Trinamool Congress.

After hearing an appeal by the BJP, a single-judge bench of the high court had on Thursday allowed the mega event, to be flagged off by BJP president Amit Shah under a re-scheduled programme from December 28 to 31.

The West Bengal government, however, challenged the ruling before a division bench of Chief Justice Debasish Kargupta and Justice Shampa Sarkar, which has now quashed the earlier ruling and sent the case back to the single-judge bench.

In its appeal, the government expressed urgency and sought immediate hearing of the matter.

Setting aside the denial of permission by the state government, the single-judge bench had allowed the 'yatra' while noting that courts can interfere if administrative authorities exercise their discretionary powers in a whimsical manner.

Following the court order, the BJP had come up with tentative new dates for its proposed three-phase programme.

After the new order, there is uncertainty once again over the mega event that was to cover all 42 Lok Sabha constituencies in the state ahead of the 2019 general elections.

Earlier on December 6, the same single-judge bench had refused permission to the BJP to hold the 'Rath Yatra', which was scheduled to be flagged off by Shah from Cooch Behar on December 7. The party had then approached the division bench.

The division bench had then asked the state chief secretary, the home secretary and the director general of police to hold a meeting with representatives of the BJP and take a decision on the 'yatra' by December 14.

After parleys with the BJP team, the three officers refused permission for the rallies on December 15 on grounds that they might lead to communal tensions.

Following this, the state BJP had moved the court of Justice Chakraborty again challenging the government's denial of permission and had got a go-ahead on Thursday.

BJP, LJP likely to strike seat sharing deal today 

","
NEW DELHI: Two days after ally LJP expressed its unease over Bihar seat sharing for the Lok Sabha polls, BJP chief Amit Shah met LJP leader Ram Vilas Paswan amid indications that the saffron party is open to discussing an enhanced share for its coalition partner and the latter may be amenable to settle for an improved deal.


While BJP general secretary Bhupendra Yadav said the alliance was intact, LJP was reticent in contrast. But privately its leaders have hinted that talks have cleared the air and LJP will remain in the NDA. “There will be another meeting on Friday and the deal is likely to be announced”, a source in the LJP said.

Earlier on Thursday, the discussions between Shah and the LJP leader, his son Chirag and brother Pashupati Nath went off well and the partners agreed on a seat-sharing formula for Bihar, said Yadav, who was also present at the meeting held at the BJP chief’s residence.

LJP caused a flutter in the NDA camp after Chirag Paswan issued a statement expressing unhappiness that BJP is not attending matters involving its partners. Coinciding with the exit of RLSP leader Upendra Kushwaha from the NDA, the remarks were read as hard bargaining as seats allotted to Kushwaha fell vacant.

With Kushwaha promptly joining the UPA on Thursday, the focus on LJP grew sharper with Paswan’s moves being seen as a possible indicator of his preparedness to jump ship. It is understood that LJP could get six seats which it holds currently, in addition to a Rajya Sabha nomination for Paswan senior.

The re-entry of JD(U) in NDA meant reduced seats for all partners and LJP was reconciled to the situation until Kushwaha left. The LJP now feels the two seats allotted to Kushwaha should fall into its kitty, and this has led to the fresh jockeying by BJP’s partner who sees a possibility for additional seats.

Chirag had created a small storm on Tuesday evening when he tweeted saying BJP needed to address concerns of its allies before it was too late and to avoid any further loss (of partners).

LJP couched its unhappiness by saying BJP “digressing” from issues of development and giving priority to Ram temple over issues of farmers and youth was a cause of worry. He had also praised the performance of Congress president Rahul Gandhi for his party’s show in three states.

It is understood that a day after BJP losses in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, Chirag Paswan had shot a letter to Jaitley seeking details of the “benefits of demonetisation” after two years.

The letter, which was also marked to PM Narendra Modi, mentioned how people stood with Modi’s decision with the hope it would result in financial gain and to end black money in the country. Chirag had claimed that he would like to share the positive impacts of demonetisation when he interacts with the electorate before Lok sabha election.

CEC bats for constitutional protection against removal of fellow commissioners 

","
NEW DELHI: Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora has pitched for equal constitutional protection to all members of the Election Commission with regard to their removal.


Arora said he ""fully endorses"" a recommendation of the Law Commission to extend constitutional protection, on the line of Chief Election Commissioner, to the two Election Commissioners.

""I endorse it. I fully endorse it,"" Arora said in response to a question. He said it was up to the government to decide on the issue.

The President appoints the Chief Election Commissioner and Election Commissioners after the law ministry initiates the file for their appointment.

A Chief Election Commissioner can be removed from the office only through impeachment by Parliament. The President can remove the ECs based on the recommendation of the CEC.

In its report on electoral reforms submitted in March, 2015, the Law Commission had proposed extending constitutional protection to the two ECs.

The EC had been pushing to extend constitutional protection to the election commissioners.

The law ministry has maintained that the granting equal protection to the two ECs needed amendment to Constitution for which political unanimity was required.

The Election Commission is a permanent Constitutional body which was established in accordance with the Constitution on January 25, 1950.

Originally, the Commission had only a Chief Election Commissioner. It currently consists of Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners.

For the first time, two additional Commissioners were appointed on October 16, 1989 but they had a very short tenure, till January 1, 1990.

Later, on October 1, 1993 two additional Election Commissioners were appointed. The concept of multi-member Commission has been in operation since then, with decision-making power by majority vote.

Water recedes in flooded Meghalaya mine, CM says time running out to rescue trapped miners 

","
SHILLONG: The water level in a flooded mine in Meghalaya receded a few inches on Friday, holding out a sliver of hope for the survival of the more than dozen men who have been trapped inside the illegal coal pit since December 13 without any food and water, police said.


As frantic rescue efforts continued for the ninth day in the mine in East Jaintia Hills district, Chief Minister Conrad Sangma said it is a major challenge and time is running out.


National Disaster Response Force team present at the coal mine in Meghalaya's East Jaintia Hills, where 13 workers… https://t.co/ndFC1lOSZB— ANI (@ANI) 1545389726000
The water in the 370-feet-deep rat hole mine initially increased after the levels in the nearby Lytein river went up. Water from the river gushed into the pit on December 13, trapping the miners.

At present only two high power pumps are being used to flush out the water from the flooded mine.

""We need more pumps. That is the crux of the matter as time is running out to rescue the miners alive,"" the chief minister told PTI at his office here.

About 200 high power pumps are needed to flush out the water from the flooded mine, he said.

""The local people are saying this and that is the scale of work we are looking at. It is a major challenge as time is running out,"" he added, expressing his concern about the survival of the trapped men who many fear could be dead.

According to Superintendent of Police (SP) of East Jaintia Hills district (SP), S Nongtynger, work on pumping out water is on with the hope that the water level will recede.

Rescue efforts have been futile since the water level in the flooded mine in East Jaintia Hills district has not receded since December 13.

Over 100 personnel from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) as well as the state police are camping on top of the mine.

The lives of the miners are at a very high risk if the rescue operation continues without much results, warned a doctor from a leading hospital.

""They have been without food and water we were informed. Time is running out for them if that is the case. Every minute is precious and authorities have to sort out the problem at the earliest possible time,"" he said.

Mining expert and award winning rescuer Jaswant Singh Gill on Thursday visited mine and suggested that the state government seek help from Coal India.

Gill, who shot to fame after he successfully rescued 64 miners from a flooded quarry in West Bengal in 1989, arrived at Lumthari village in the district and expressed concern after seeing the water level at the mine and on receiving inputs about rat hole mining practised in the state, a police officer said.

""As it is established that water that got in the mine was from the nearby river, we have to find out the location and plug it to prevent further water flow into the mine,"" Gill told reporters.

""I have also advised the government to request Coal India to bring four to five high power submersible pumps which can be returned after use,"" he said.

The district authorities are in the process of sending Gill's advice to the state government, a senior district told PTI on Friday.

The chief minister also said he is yet to get an official report from the deputy commissioner on the recommendations made by Gill, the former mining engineer and mine expert.

A National Green Tribunal (NGT) committee has asked the state government to pay compensation to the next of kin of all who have been killed in mine accidents in the state.

Killer rat-hole mines ruin ecology too 

","
SHILLONG: Almost a week after Sayeb Ali, 21, survived after being trapped in an illegal ‘rathole’ coal mine at Ksan in Meghalaya’s East Jaintia Hills, he is constantly hounded by a feeling of guilt — that he helplessly saw his fellow-miners being engulfed by water that flooded the 350-foot-deep mine. Fourteen people are still trapped inside the pit since December 13. They have the slimmest chance of survival even as rescue operations are on. 


“I survived, but seeing family members of my friends who couldn’t make it causes me pain. Images of my friends who were in the pit hounds me,” says Sayeb, who earns Rs 2,000 per day in the mines, money which he can never hope to get in any other job. The money comes with danger, and there is no health insurance or other cover for a job which poses such hazards to health and life. This is just the latest accident after the National Green Tribunal’s ban on rat-hole mining in the state on April 17, 2014. 

In 2012, at least 15 persons were trapped inside a rat-hole mine in Nangalbibra of South Garo Hills. No one knows what happened to them. Since then, several mine collapses have occurred. Many of the casualties have gone unreported because of the clandestine nature of coal mining. According to activists, in case of accidents involving migrant miners, the people running the operation simply hush things up. 

Activist Angela Rangad told TOI, “Heightened criminality has meant such accidents go unreported and local administration and police are not proactive. Perhaps this time it received attention because some of the miners trapped inside were locals.” Even CM Conrad Sangma admitted that after the Ksan disaster, illegal mining was a flourishing business. 

“It is difficult to keep a foolproof check on illegal mining, but district administrations have been asked to step up their vigil,” he said. Meanwhile, criminal elements associated with the illegal mining business have become increasingly aggressive. On November 8, Civil Society Women’s Organisation president Agnes Kharshiing and her associate Amita Sangma were injured in an attack by goons at Sohshrieh in East Jaintia Hills district. Agnes and Amita were taking photographs of trucks being loaded with coal from rat-hole mines when they were attacked. An RTI activist, Popynhum Majaw, was murdered in Khliehriat, a coal mining hub, in March this year. 

“They left us for dead on the road. The attack cannot silence us,” Amita said. In Meghalaya, coal mines are privately owned. In the predominantly tribal state, communities own land and have rights over resources. But because of the lucrative returns from coal mining that is also said to be one of the chief revenue sources for the government, community-owned lands are increasingly being privatised and used for non-agricultural activities like coal mining. 

This has triggered unabated extraction of coal through ratholes which range between 5 and 100 sq m of vertical pits, branching into networks of horizontal channels, which are at constant risk of caving in or flooding. According to some activists, the process has exploded since the 1970s, at the cost of human lives and the environment. Ministers and MLAs across party lines in the state government are mine owners. The state’s politics is enmeshed with the mining issue, which became a pivotal topic during the assembly elections earlier this year. 

The 2014 ban, during Congress rule, faced stiff resistance from mine owners. BJP and its ally NPP, which eventually won elections, promised to find a solution through “scientific mining”. The fallout of mining operations can be seen in the environment as well. The 2014 ban by NGT was based on a petition filed by All Dimasa Students’ Union after water of Kopili river in Assam allegedly turning acidic due to seepage of chemicals from coal mines in the Jaintia Hills. A water quality report in coal mining areas of the state by a team from North-Eastern Hill University in Shillong pointed out that in Jaintia Hills large scale forest denudation, scarcity of water, pollution of air, water and soil and degradation of agricultural lands “are some of the conspicuous environmental implications of coal mining”.

Sena key to Maha success, finds BJP study 

","
MUMBAI: An internal BJP survey reveals that even if it contests the general election in alliance with the Shiv Sena, a repeat of the 2014 performance is not likely in the state. 


 The BJP-Shiv-Sena combine had secured 40 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in the state in the 2014 election. Currently, the BJP has 22 of the 48 seats, the Shiv Sena has 18, the Congress holds two, the NCP has 5, and one seat is held by the Swabhimani Paksha . ""If we contest the Lok Sabha polls jointly, we will win fewer than 30 to 34 seats and if we contest separately, the BJP may win 15 to 18 seats, while the Shiv Sena will be able to secure five to eight seats. In that event, the Congress-NCP combine will win 22 to 28 seats,"" a former BJP minister said. 

 The former BJP minister said that to avoid a dismal performance, BJP president Amit Shah was insisting on an alliance with the Shiv Sena. ""Shah felt that all-out efforts should be made to reach out to Shiv Sena and ensure that BJP-Shiv-Sena repeats the 2014 performance.""

Court directs CBI to cancel look out circular against ex-IAF chief 

","
NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Friday directed the CBI to cancel the look out circular (LOC) issued against former IAF chief SP Tyagi, who is an accused in the VVIP chopper scam.


Special judge Arvind Kumar directed the probe agency to inform the concerned authorities about it.

CBI had issued LOC against Tyagi in 2013. It is a circular issued by the authorities to check if a person who is travelling is wanted by the law enforcement agencies.

The CBI on September 1, 2017, had filed a charge sheet in the case in which Tyagi and British national Christian 
Michel were named as accused along with others.

Eight others were also named in the chargesheet in connection with a bribery case in the VVIP chopper deal.

Tyagi (73) is the first chief of the Indian Air Force to be chargesheeted in a corruption or a criminal case by the CBI and he has denied all charges against him.

On January 1, 2014, India scrapped the contract with Italy-based Finmeccanica's British subsidiary AgustaWestland for supplying 12 AW-101 VVIP choppers to the IAF over alleged breach of contractual obligations and charges of paying kickbacks to the tune of Rs 423 crore by it for securing the deal.

The CBI has alleged there was an estimated loss of 398.21 million euro (approximately Rs 2,666 crore) to the exchequer in the deal that was signed on February 8, 2010 for the supply of VVIP choppers worth 556.262 million euro.

Besides Tyagi, the agency has also chargesheeted retired Air Marshal JS Gujral along with eight others, including five foreign nationals, in the charge sheet filed in the court.

The company, AgustaWestland, is also one of the accused.

Others named in the charge sheet are -- Tyagi's cousin Sanjeev alias Julie, advocate Gautam Khaitan, alleged European middlemen Carlo Gerosa, Christian 
Michel, Guido Haschke, former AgustaWestland CEO Bruno Spagnolini and former Finmeccanica Chairman Giuseppe Orsi.

Maharashtra: MHA authorises 10 central agencies to access any computer resource 

","
NEW DELHI: The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Thursday issued an order authorising ten security and intelligence agencies of the country to access any information stored in any computer for the purpose of monitoring, decrypting and interception.


In its order dated December 20, 2018, the cyber and information security division of MHA under the sub-section (1) of section 69 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, authorised the Intelligence Bureau, Narcotics Control Bureau, Enforcement Directorate, Central Board of Direct Taxes, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Central Bureau of Investigation; National Investigation Agency, Cabinet Secretariat (R&AW), Directorate of Signal Intelligence (For service areas of Jammu & Kashmir, North-East and Assam only) and Commissioner of Police, Delhi, to access any computer resource.



Undersigned by Union Home Secretary, Rajiv Gauba, the order mandates for a subscriber or service provider or any person in charge of the computer resource to extend technical assistance to the agencies. Non-compliance will invite seven-year imprisonment and fine.

The order drew sharp reaction from CPM leader Sitaram Yechury who took to Twitter condemning the order as ""unconstitutional"".

""Why is every Indian being treated like a criminal? This order by a govt wanting to snoop on every citizen is unconstitutional and in breach of the telephone tapping guidelines, the Privacy Judgement and the Aadhaar judgement,"" wrote Yechury.




Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram compared the order to a situation called ""Orwellian state"".

""Not studied the matter, but if anybody is going to monitor computers then it is an Orwellian state,"" said Chidambaram.

Snooping row: Chidambaram says Orwellian state round the corner 

","
BENGALURU: Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Friday criticised the government's move to authorise 10 Central agencies to intercept ""any information"" on ""any computer"" and said an ""Orwellian state is round the corner"". He, however, added that he had not studied the matter. 


""I don't want to give (an) off the cuff answer, but anybody is going to monitor the computers, including yours. What is an Orwellian state? George Orwellian (state) is round the corner,"" the former Union home minister told reporters. 

""It is condemnable, but let me say I have not studied the matter, therefore do not take my answer as the final answer,"" Chidambaram said. 

'Orwellian' is used to describe a political system in which the government tries to control every part of people's lives, similar to what has been described by George Orwell in his dystopian novel 'Nineteen Eighty-Four'. 

In an order on Thursday, the Union home ministry authorised 10 central agencies such as the Intelligence Bureau, Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate to intercept, monitor, and decrypt ""any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer"". 

The move created a political storm with the opposition parties decrying it as unconstitutional, undemocratic and an assault on fundamental rights. 

Asked about the stance of former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan and other economists against farm loan waivers, Chidambaram said they should comment on the issue after gaining experience of farming. 

""Take two acres of land and do farming and then you should ask them to comment on farm loan waiver,"" he said. 

On December 14, Rajan had said farm loan waivers should not be a part of poll promises and had written to the Election Commission to take the issue off the table. 

Recently, the Congress announced farm loan waivers in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, days after coming to power in the heartland states. 

Chidambaram said people and not economists will decide whether farm loan waiver is good or bad politics. 

He said farm loan waiver has become an imperative. 

""The average indebtedness of (a) farmer's family is between Rs 90,000 to Rs 1 lakh. How will that family ever repay this loan? Therefore, it has become an imperative,"" the former finance minister said. 

""Our governments in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan have responded to dire needs of the situation,"" Chidambaram said. 

He claimed 108 farmers had committed suicide in one district of Maharashtra alone.

Sohrabuddin case: All 22 accused acquitted in Sohrabuddin encounter case 

","
MUMBAI: A special CBI court on Friday acquitted all 22 accused of the 

  2005 alleged fake encounters
 + of gangster Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife Kauser Bi. While 21 accused were junior-level police officials from Gujarat, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, one was the owner of the farmhouse where Sheikh and his wife were held before the alleged murders.


The accused were additionally also acquitted on charges of being involved in the 2006 alleged staged encounter of Tulsiram Prajapati, Sheikh’s associate and a witness to his alleged abduction. 

According to special CBI Judge S J Sharma, the prosecution failed to put forth any ""documentary and substantive evidence"" to suggest or establish the alleged conspiracy.

According to the CBI’s case, on November 23, 2005, Shaekh was allegedly abducted from a bus near Hyderabad while he was on his way to Sangli (Maharashtra) with his wife Kausar Bi. He was allegedly abducted by police personnel of ATS, Gujarat. The couple was then taken to Ahmedabad, and on November 26, 2005, Sohrabuddin was killed in a fake encounter by cops from the Gujarat and Rajasthan police. The CBI alleged that a few days later, Kausar Bi was killed and her body disposed of by burning it at a river bed near village Illol in Gujarat. Prajapati an alleged eyewitness and believed to be an associate of Sohrabuddin, was taken to Udaipur, Rajasthan. A year later, in December 2006, he too was killed in an alleged fake encounter near Chapri on the Gujarat-Rajasthan border, the CBI said.

The trial in the case commenced last December. Over the last year, 210 witnesses deposed, among whom 92 turned hostile. 

The case was transferred to a city court in 2012 following a Supreme Court order in 2010. Over the years, of the 38 accused booked initially, 16 including BJP president Amit Shah were discharged in the case.

Can't tax luxury items at same rate as essential goods, says Arun Jaitley

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Arun Jaitley clashed with Congress chief Rahul Gandhi on Thursday over GST, saying the UPA had left behind a legacy of 31% indirect tax on most items and that a single slab, suggested by Congress, was indeed unworkable as it would mean equating luxury and sin goods with common items. 


 Jaitley reacted to Rahul Gandhi's tweet following PM Narendra Modi's statement that 99% of items would be under 18% rate, including most goods and services availed by common people. ""The Congress party has finally jolted Narendraji from his deep slumber on Gabbar Singh Tax.

Scientific cleaning & conservation plan designed by ASI to protect Taj Mahal: Government 

","
NEW DELHI: The Archaeological Survey of India has formulated a scientific cleaning and conservation plan to protect the surface of the iconic Taj Mahal from deposited pollutants, the Centre told the Lok Sabha on Friday. Minister of state for environment Mahesh Sharma, in a written reply, said according to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the pollutants from various sources have been superficially getting deposited on the marble surface of Taj Mahal as particulate matters, and due to scattering of light by these deposited particles, the marble surface appears to have changed in colour. 


""The ASI has formulated scientific cleaning and conservation plan to protect the surface of Taj Mahal from deposited pollutants,"" he said. 

""Accordingly, all four minarets, eight facades, four pedestal marble walls, interior portion of the periphery up to human height and four 'chhatries' at the rooftop of the main mausoleum, have already been cleaned and treated. However, the cleaning of the main dome requires some technical studies,"" he said. 

Sharma said the ASI has informed that the water level of Yamuna was away from the northern wall of Taj Mahal. 

""Therefore, specific study on the link between Yamuna water and the strength of the foundation of Taj Mahal has not been conducted,"" he said. 

The Uttar Pradesh government had recently told the Supreme Court that it had paid 80 per cent money i.e. Rs 51.89 lakh to Delhi-based School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) which is entrusted with the task of preparing a vision document for the protection of Taj Mahal. 

Taj Mahal, the monument of love, is among the Seven Wonders of the World.

Rafale deal should not go 'unchallenged': P Chidambaram 

","
BENGALURU: Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram Friday said the Rs 60,000 crore worth Rafale deal should not go ""unchallenged"" after the Supreme Court expressed its limitations to examine it because of its jurisdictional limits.


He alleged the Centre deliberately misled the court and later accused it of ""misinterpreting"" the note.

""The government is also giving lessons in English grammar to the court,"" he told reporters here.

""A defence deal worth Rs 60,000 crore that will leave the country with only 36 aircraft, as against 126 contracted for under the UPA, cannot go unchallenged or unexamined, especially after Supreme Court expressed its limitations to examine the case due to jurisdictional limits,"" Chidambaram said.

The party (Congress), therefore, is taking up the cause before the people and asking them to support its demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to probe the deal, he said.

The former Union finance minister also questioned the decision to cancel an earlier MoU and enter into a new agreement.

The governments of India and France had entered into an MoU under which India would buy 126 Rafale twin-engine multi-role fighter aircraft, he said.

The price per aircraft discovered through an international bid opened on December 12, 2012 was Rs 526.10 crore, Chidambaram said, adding Dassault, the manufacturer, would supply 18 aircraft in fly-away condition.

The remaining 108 aircraft would be manufactured in India at the Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd's (HAL) facilities in Bengaluru using Dassault technology that would be available to HAL under a Transfer of Technology agreement, he said.

""This MoU was cancelled and the prime minister announced the new deal on April 10, 2015,"" he added.

Chidambaram also questioned the government for its decision to buy only 36 aircraft when the need was for at least 126 aircraft.

He said by all accounts, the government was purchasing the same aircraft from the same manufacturer under the same configuration.

""The last phrase is found in the joint statement dated April 10, 2015. Is it true that the price per aircraft under the new agreement is Rs 1,670 crore (as disclosed by Dassault) and, if true, what is the justification for the three-fold price increase?"" he said.

The former finance minister said if the price of the aircraft under the new agreement was indeed cheaper by 9 per cent, as claimed by the government, ""why is it buying only 36 aircraft and not all the 126 aircraft offered by Dassault?"".

He also asked the reason for scrapping the agreement to transfer the technology to HAL, which has an experience of 77 years and has manufactured a variety of aircraft under licence from the respective manufacturer.

""When entering into the new agreement, there was no mention of Transfer of Technology from Dassault to HAL,"" he said.

Chidambaram said former French President Francois Hollande had disclosed that the Indian government had suggested the name of a private sector company as the offset partner, and that France and Dassault had ""no choice"" in the matter.

The Centre, however, has denied that it had suggested the name.

""The question that arises is, did the government suggest any name at all and, if not, why did it not suggest the name of HAL?"" the Congress leader added.

Snooping row: Jaitley says order issued under 2009 rules, cites national security 

","
NEW DELHI: As its move to allow 10 agencies to intercept information on computers triggered a row, the government on Friday said the authorisation was given under 2009 rules and dismissed opposition's charge of snooping, saying they were playing with national security and ""making a mountain where even a molehill doesn't exist"".


The issue rocked Rajya Sabha as Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad alleged that ""undeclared Emergency has taken final shape"" and ""all federal agencies have been let loose"".

Union Minister Arun Jaitley hit back saying Congress was crying foul over powers created by it when it was in government.

Congress leader Anand Sharma said the issue is serious as it is related to fundamental rights and ""India will become a police state"" with such ""sweeping powers"" to agencies to intercept information.


Responding to the charge, Jaitley said it would have been better if the Opposition had obtained all information before raising this issue. He told the House that the rules under which agencies will be authorised to intercept information were framed in 2009 when the Congress-led UPA was in power.

""So what you are doing Mr Anand Sharma is making a mountain where even a molehill does not exist.

""You must know this and as a leader of opposition your word is sacrosanct, so don't use it for a purpose where a power which you created, which is to be used in national security cases, now you are crying foul about that power,"" Jaitley said in the Upper House.

However, Azad retorted that there is no mention of national security in the order. ""The BJP seems to think it has ownership rights over national security and it means nothing to us,"" he said taking a swipe at the government.

To this, Jaitley said, ""These are elementary things. It is an authorisation order. The provisions of national security are written in Article 69.... You are playing with the security of the country. That is what you have done just now"".

Since the Act has been in place these orders of authorisation are repeated from time to time, he said, adding that they can be used for interception in cases related to national security, disruption of public order, etc.

""When senior members from opposition raise an issue every word spoken by them has precious value and therefore they must know facts,"" Jaitley told the House.

Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad questioned if the Congress does not want action against terrorists and those who play with national security.

Unhappy with the government's response, the opposition members were on their feet raising slogans.

Congress Leader Anand Sharma said the issue raised by Azad is serious as it is related to fundamental rights.

""Right to privacy of every citizen on which the Supreme Court has also given its decision is a fundamental right.

""Nine agencies and the Delhi Police have been given a sweeping power to intercept through an executive order. India will become a police state, this is not acceptable,"" Sharma said.

The issue was also raised in Lok Sabha during Zero Hour with Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) leader N K Premachandran who alleged that the move is a violation of the fundamental rights.

The order authorises 10 central agencies such as the Intelligence Bureau, Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate to intercept, monitor and decrypt any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer.

Officers express outrage over Moily's remarks 

","
NEW DELHI: Several armed forces officers on Thursday expressed outrage over senior Congress leader Veerappa Moily's allegation that Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa was ""lying"" about the Rafale jet deal, stressing the IAF chief only stated that his force desperately needed new fighters and had refused to get into the ongoing political dogfight over the matter. 


 ""The IAF chief has unnecessarily been dragged into the political controversy between BJP and Congress. Serving officers cannot respond to political comments,"" said a senior officer. 

 Added another, ""Unfortunately, as has been seen over the decades, such scandals and controversies only end up hitting the modernisation of the armed forces. If there is any wrongdoing in any deal, ensure the guilty are punished, but don't derail desperately-needed military inductions."" 

 Responding to questions on Wednesday, in the backdrop of the Supreme Court dismissing petitions seeking a probe into the Rs 59,000 crore deal with France for 36 Rafale fighters, ACM Dhanoa had said the acquisition of the jets was a critical operational necessity for his force. 

 ""We are saying we need the Rafales. The government is saying we need them. The SC, which has given a good judgment, has said the IAF needs them. It has taken us so long to get the fighters, and in the meantime our regional adversaries or neighbours have upgraded (their military capabilities),"" he said. 

""I will not go into the politics of it because it is a separate issue. But I don't think there is any technical argument against the aircraft as such. Everybody agrees it's a good aircraft and that we need it given our strategic scenario,"" he added.

 The IAF has earlier also strongly defended the Rafale deal, stressing the fighters would prove to be ""gamechangers"" in air combat capabilities in the region . The then IAF vice-chief Air Marshal S B Deo had dismissed the controversy over the Rafale acquisition as ""ill-in formed"".

Oppn slams govt on Naseer remark; BJP calls it PR stunt

NEW DELHI: Congress and NCP latched on to actor Naseeruddin Shah's comment that the ""death of a cow has more significance than that of a police officer"" to attack BJP, saying it was vitiating the country's atmosphere for political gains. BJP, on the other hand, dubbed Shah's views as an attempt to defame the government as part of a conspiracy ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. 


""We concur, do not fear the hate, fight it,"" Congress tweeted from its official handle. Party leader Prithviraj Chavan told reporters in Indore that secular citizens were living in an ""atmosphere of fear"" because of BJP's attempts to polarize people on religious grounds. 

""We have a fear that if the Narendra Modi government comes back to power after the Lok Sabha elections, then neither the Constitution nor democracy will survive,"" he added. 

BJP dismissed Shah's comments as a ""PR stunt."" ""This is not a tolerance and intolerance debate. This is a PR stunt,"" party spokesperson Sambit Patra said. Party MP Prahlad Patel added, ""This country has given so much to actors like Shah... he had earned name, fame and respect among Indians. Still if he feels that this country is not safe, he should take a call and settle in the country of his choice.""

‘Post-Urjit, not difficult for govt to manage markets’ 

","
Former finance minister Yashwant Sinha has been a bitter critic of the Narendra Modi government. In his upcoming book India Unmade, he steps up the attack on the government's economic policies and also offers suggestions to tackle farm distress through a direct cash transfer scheme for farmers. Excerpts from an interview to Surojit Gupta

• Why this strident criticism of the government's economic policy now?
I waited for over three years and watched the situation very, very carefully. When I found that the government was taking one foolish step after another like demonetisation and a botched up GST, I wrote an article expressing concern at the fall in growth rate and other issues and also said that rhetoric was alright for elections but rhetoric will not lead to increase in growth rate. That created a ripple, and there were many articles written in response saying that everything was hunky dory. The purpose of the book is to cut through the propaganda and convey the truth to the people with regard to many economic issues.


• How would you assess the health of the economy?
An economy makes progress on the basis of investments by the private sector and the government. Now, for whatever reasons, increasing NPAs (non-performing assets) etc, private investment has been negligible in the last four years. There is slight pick-up now but that is not enough to support or give momentum to the economy. Government investments are also minimal because the government is spending its budgetary resources, as in the past, on maintenance — it’s all revenue expenditure, very little investment expenditure. The economy is starved of funds. Of late, they are trying to squeeze expenditure to maintain the fiscal deficit target. Banks are reluctant to lend. And this standoff between the RBI and government is basically about liquidity. Then you have the case of the ILF&FS which has led to Rs 95,000 crore NPAs and NBFCs, which play a critical role in financing, have also been hit very badly. The economy is in dire straits.


• What is your view on Urjit Patel’s resignation as RBI governor?
The information which is in public domain is only the tip of the iceberg. Much more will come out in due course. Markets did not react adversely to his resignation because we are all aware that with all the resources at the command of the government, it is not difficult to manage the market for a day or two.


• What would you suggest to alleviate farm distress?
There is a permanent conflict of interest between the producer and the consumer and in our economic history, we find that governments have supported consumer interest more than the farmers’ interest. It is only in the last year that the government has tried to fulfill its promise of raising minimum support price by one and a half times. I have supported a basic income scheme for farmers because that is the only way in which this conflict of interest between the consumer and the producer can be resolved.


• Do you expect this idea to be pushed through in the upcoming interim budget?
They could do it. The total cost of this works out to Rs 2 lakh crore, and I have suggested that the burden should be distributed in the ratio of 70% for government of India and 30% for the state governments. We could see how it works and then improve the system.


• Do you think the PM will listen to your advice?
Sometimes they have acted on the advice that I have offered publicly without acknowledging it, and sometimes they have ignored it. Let’s see what they do this time.

Jharkhand high court defers hearing on Lalu Prasad's bail plea 

","
RANCHI: The Jharkhand high court on Friday deferred the hearing on bail petitions moved by jailed RJD chief Lalu Prasad after the CBI counsel said he was yet to receive a report on the former chief minister's health condition.


Advocate Kapil Sibal appeared for Prasad in the court.

After considering the CBI counsel's request, the court of Justice Aparesh Kumar Singh fixed January 4 as the next date for hearing, Prabhat Kumar, another lawyer representing the RJD chief, told reporters.

""CBI counsel Rajiv Sinha had requested the court to fix another date for hearing on the bail petition on the ground that he was yet to get a status report on the petitioner's health from his doctors,"" he added.

On December 11, Prasad filed petition in the high court requesting bail in three fodder scam cases in which he has been convicted, citing old age and poor health.

In his petition, Prasad said he was now 71 and suffering from diabetes, blood pressure and other ailments and that he had already obtained bail in one of the fodder scam cases.

Prasad has been convicted in fodder scam cases pertaining to fraudulent withdrawal of money from Deoghar, Dumka and two Chaibasa treasuries.

He got bail in one of the two Chaibasa-treasury related cases.

He is currently facing a fifth case pertaining to Doranda treasury.

The Rashtriya Janata Dal chief, who was jailed in December last year, has been undergoing treatment at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences in Ranchi.

LS OKs consumer bill allowing recall, damages, stiff fines 

","
NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Thursday passed the Consumer Protection Bill which provides for recall of faulty products, allows buyers to seek compensation for defective items or deficiency in services and prescribes penalties for manufacturing or selling adulterated items. The penalty and jail term has been linked to impact of adulterated products on human health with a proposal for seven years to life imprisonment and at least Rs 10 lakh fine in case of death caused by any adulterated products. 


The proposed law, which is being overhauled after a gap of 32 years, has provisions for imposing fines on celebrities for endorsing false or misleading advertisements and penalties including jail term for manufacturers for committing the offence. The bill also provides for consumers to file complaints with the consumer commissions at the place of residence or work and not from where he purchased product or availed a service, which is the present norm.

Seeking to empower consumers and protect them from getting shortchanged by manufacturers and marketing agencies, the bill, which awaits approval of Rajya Sabha to become a law, proposes setting up of a Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) which will have the power to take suo motu cognisance of offence or malpractice and act on consumer complaints to act against the violators. 

 It will also have the power to file ""class action"" complaints before the consumer disputes redressal commissions in case a large number of people are impacted.

","
NEW DELHI: In yet another step towards improving ties, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and her Chinese counterpart RWang Yi Friday held extensive talks under a newly established framework and agreed on ""ten pillars"" of cooperation to enhance cultural and people-to-people exchanges.
 

 Wang, who arrived here early Friday morning, said he had a ""very successful"" meeting with Swaraj under the 'High Level Mechanism on Cultural and People-to-People Exchanges' that was decided upon during the Wuhan summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping. 

""India-China relations have reached a new historical stage,"" he said at the inaugural session of 3rd India-China High Level Media Forum. 

 Swaraj, in her remarks, said she was satisfied with the outcome of her two-hour dialogue with Wang during which they discussed ways to expand cultural and people-to-people ties. 

She said India and China have agreed on '10 pillars' of cooperation to enhance cultural and people-to-people exchanges. 

 The 10 pillars are cultural exchange, cooperation in films and television, cooperation in museum administration, cooperation sports, exchanges between youths, cooperation on tourism, exchanges between states and cities, cooperation in traditional medicine, cooperation in yoga and cooperation in education. 

Bilateral cooperation has improved significantly after the Wuhan Summit, Swaraj said, noting that the militaries of two countries were also enhancing cooperation. 

 Wang described the new mechanism for cultural and people-to-people exchanges as a ""major initiative"" in the history of India-China ties.

UK says still more to do against IS after US and Syria pullout - Times of India

","
LONDON: Britain has insisted ""much remains to be done"" in fighting the Islamic State group in Syria, amid reports Thursday it was not given prior warning of President Donald Trump's decision to pull out US ground troops. ""The global coalition against Daesh has made huge progress,"" said a government statement issued late Wednesday, referring to the jihadists. 


""Since military operations began, the coalition and its partners in Syria and Iraq have recaptured the vast majority of Daesh territory and important advances have been made in recent days in the last area of eastern Syria which Daesh has occupied. 

""But much remains to be done and we must not lose sight of the threat they pose. Even without territory, Daesh will remain a threat."" Junior defence minister Tobias Ellwood was more blunt, retweeting a message from Trump that the jihadists had been defeated in Syria with the words: ""I strongly disagree. 

""It has morphed into other forms of extremism and the threat is very much alive."" Trump declared on Wednesday that IS had been ""beaten"" in Syria and announced the pullout of American ground forces from the war-ravaged nation. 

Currently, about 2,000 US forces are in Syria, most of them on a train-and-advise mission to support local forces fighting IS. 

The Pentagon refused to say what effect the troop withdrawal would have on air operations in Syria that have been ongoing since late 2014. 

Britain takes part in the air strikes as part of an international coalition. 

The statement from London said: ""We remain committed to the global coalition and the campaign to deny Daesh territory and ensure its enduring defeat, working alongside our critical regional partners in Syria and beyond. 

""As the situation on the ground develops, we will continue to discuss how we achieve these aims with our coalition partners, including the US."" The Times newspaper on Thursday reported that Britain had not been informed of the decision before Trump announced it.

Forget chill over HUAWEI row, Canada a hot draw for Chinese - Times of India

","
NEW DELHI: At the fag end of 2018, China and Canada find themselves caught in a diplomatic kerfuffle over the arrest at US’ behest of Chinese telecom giant Huawei’s CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver. But away from official power games, the ordinary Chinese traveller has found Canada an inviting destination in recent years and visitors from the country have ignited a boom in Canadian tourism. Here's a look at the numbers and how Canada remains a big favourite for Indians, too.






70,000 CHINESE TOURISTS WENT TO CANADA IN 2018


In 2018, as many as 70,000 Chinese tourists visited Canada. That makes China the second-largest source of visitors to Canada, behind US. On the other hand, UK, which was at the No. 2 spot for three decades, fell to third position. Chinese travellers to Canada have sparked a tourism renaissance in the North American country after a lull that began in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.









‘FOOD AS GOOD AS HONG KONG’
Canada began figuring in Chinese traveller’s holiday plans 8 years back, when Beijing extended its ‘Approved Destination Status’ to Canada. That meant Chinese citizens had permission to travel to the country Industry insiders say Canada is an attractive destination for MICE travel, or the meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions segment Further, big Canadian cities have large Chinese communities. “My clients are surprised that they can eat food here that’s as good as Hong Kong,” a tour operator told Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

NUMBER OF INDIAN VISITORS KEEPS GROWING
India has climbed to 8th from 13 th in 1990 in terms of visitors to Canada. Although India had slid to No.17 in the mid-90s, the country has seen a gradual rise thereafter in people visiting Canada, which has a large Indian diaspora. People of Indian origin make up nearly 4% of Canada’s population.

Six suspected jihadists killed in French air strike in Mali: Military - Times of India

","
PARIS: At least six suspected members of a jihadist group were killed overnight in a French air strike in southeastern Mali, a French military spokesman said Thursday.



 A surveillance drone followed eight ""members of an armed terrorist group"" as they crossed the border on motorcycles from Niger into Mali, Colonel Patrik Steiger said.

 A French fighter jet attacked the group, with ground forces then intervening, in an operation that claimed the lives of at least six of them, he added

 Jihadists in the region have mostly swapped pick-ups for more inconspicuous motorbikes, which allow them to travel on rough roads and tracks through the desert.

 The operation revealed however that even these bikers are being monitored from the air.

 The French military did not specify which jihadist group the men belonged to but a regional Al-Qaeda affiliate has long been active in the region.

 France helped Malian forces defeat jihadist insurgents that took control of the three main towns in the country's north in 2012, but large swathes of the hinterland remain beyond the government's control.

 France, the former colonial ruler, has deployed a 4,500-member 'Barkhane' force in the region to conduct counter-terrorism operations.

 Until now the force has intervened mainly in Mali, while also focussing on training troops in Burkina Faso and the other nations of the G5 Sahel military alliance -- Chad, Mauritania and Niger.

 However, the insurgents have progressively expanded their reach, carrying out attacks on government forces, notably in Burkina Faso and Niger.

US charges two Chinese over alleged state-sponsored hacking - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: The United States has charged two Chinese men it says hacked the computer systems of companies and government agencies in a dozen countries, in what Washington says was a wide-reaching state-backed campaign of cyber-espionage.


NASA and the US Navy were among those allegedly targeted in a programme the US Justice Department said also hit a major bank, telecom companies and healthcare providers in 12 countries.

The charges drew a furious response from Beijing, which accused Washington of ""fabricating facts"".

Deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein said China had repeatedly broken President Xi Jinping's 2015 pledge to halt cyberattacks on US companies and commercial infrastructure.

""It is unacceptable that we continue to uncover cybercrime committed by China against other nations,"" he said.

""We want China to cease its illegal cyber activities and honor its commitment to the international community.

""But the evidence suggests that China may not intend to live up to its promises.""

US ally Britain also joined the charge, with Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt saying Beijing continued to hack computer systems for commercial and economic motives.

""These activities must stop. They go against the commitments made to the UK in 2015, and, as part of the G20, not to conduct or support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property or trade secrets,"" he said.

American officials said evidence showed hackers had targeted Managed Service Providers (MSPs)- specialist firms that help companies manage their information technology systems- potentially giving them access to the computer networks of dozens of companies.

Individual firms were not named in the indictment, but the 45 victims in the United States included government agencies- NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the US Navy, from which the personal information of more than 100,000 personnel was stolen.

Internationally, the hackers are alleged to have broken into the computers of a major bank, three telecommunications or consumer electronics companies, mining and healthcare firms, and business consultancies.

Beijing lashed out at the claims, the latest in a roiling dispute over cybersecurity that pits China against the US and its western allies.

""The United States is fabricating facts, creating something from nothing, and unwarrantedly denouncing China on cybersecurity issues,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Friday.

Beijing said it had lodged an official protest over the charges and warned the US to drop the prosecution, ""to avoid serious damage to the relations between the two countries"".

The Justice Department said the two alleged hackers, Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong, worked for the APT10 group, which Washington, London and other allies say is backed by China's Ministry of State Security.

From at least 2006 to 2018, the APT10 Group ""conducted extensive campaigns of intrusions into computer systems around the world"", the Justice Department said.

APT10 stole ""hundreds of gigabytes"" of sensitive data and information from its targets, invading their systems through the hacked MSPs, it added.

The indictments of the two men came less than two months after the US charged 10 Chinese also allegedly linked to APT10- including two intelligence officers- over a five-year scheme to steal aircraft engine technology from US and French aerospace firms.

Those cases involved both hacking and recruiting insiders to steal data and IT system passwords.

Relations between Washington and Beijing are already frayed over trade, hacking and geopolitical issues.

In October, the Department of Justice obtained the unprecedented extradition of a senior Chinese intelligence official from Belgium to stand trial in the United States for running the effort to steal US aviation industry secrets.

In early December, Canada arrested an executive of leading Chinese telecom company Huawei at Washington's request.

The US plans to charge her with fraud related to sanctions-breaking business dealings with Iran.

Since then, China has detained Canadian citizens, in what observers say is an apparent bid to pressure Ottawa into releasing the Huawei executive.

And, according to reports, US officials believe Chinese government-linked hackers were behind the theft of data on some 500 million guests of hotel giant Marriott, first reported on November 30.

Last week, Bill Priestap, head of the FBI's counterintelligence division, told Congress that China's cyberattacks were part of a broad campaign against the US.

""The Chinese government is attempting to acquire or steal not only the plans and intentions of the United States government, but also the ideas and innovations of the very people that make our economy so incredibly successful,"" he said.

Third Canadian was held for working in China illegally - Times of India

","
BEIJING: The third Canadian detained in China is being held for working illegally in the country, the Chinese foreign ministry said Thursday amid diplomatic tensions over the previous two detentions on national security grounds.


The Canadian, a woman named Sarah McIver, faces ""administrative penalties"", said Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying at a press briefing in Beijing, without specifying what the penalties entail. 

Canada's National Post newspaper has identified McIver as a teacher from Alberta.

Hua said that McIver's case is different from the previous two detentions, which were carried out by China's state security apparatus.

McIver is being held by a local public security bureau, said Hua.

On December 10, former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and China-based business consultant Michael Spavor were both detained and accused of engaging in activities ""that endanger China's national security"".

The detention of the three Canadians comes against a backdrop of escalating tensions between China and Canada, which arrested Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wangzhou on December 1.

Meng was released on bail last week in Vancouver pending a US extradition hearing on US fraud charges related to sanctions-breaking business dealings with Iran.

Prayers, tributes in Lockerbie mark 30 years since Pan Am bombing - Times of India

","
LOCKERBIE, SCOTLAND: A simple wreath-laying and prayer service in Lockerbie on Friday marked 30 years since a jumbo jet was blown up over the small Scottish town, killing 270 people.


Pan Am flight 103 exploded on its way from London to New York a few days before Christmas in 1988, killing all 259 people on board and another 11 on the ground. It is the deadliest ever militant attack in Britain.

Lockerbie, near the English border, with a population of just 4,000 people, has been synonymous with the tragedy ever since.

""Let us find hope and peace for all those who lost loved ones and who still carry the scars of this atrocity,"" Jeff Brown, who directed the religious service, told those assembled.

The memorial service at Dryfesdale Cemetery was attended by Lord Lieutenant Fiona Armstrong, who conveyed a personal message from Queen Elizabeth.

""I send my prayers and good wishes to all those who will be marking this solemn anniversary,"" she said.

Libyan intelligence officer Abdel Basset al-Megrahi was found guilty of the bombing, along with others who were never identified, and was jailed for life in 2001.

Megrahi was later released because he was suffering from cancer. He died in 2012.

US allies in Asia-Pacific region rattled after Mattis quits - Times of India

","
SYDNEY: The abrupt resignation of US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis sparked concern among Asia-Pacific allies who credit the retired general with building trust and tempering isolationist impulses, regional officials and analysts said on Friday.


The region - which includes strong US allies Japan, South Korea and Australia - hosts some of the world's most volatile flashpoints, with high tension on the Korean peninsula and China's militarisation of the South China Sea causing friction.

Mattis, who embraced America's traditional alliances, said he was quitting after falling out with President Donald Trump over foreign policy, including surprise decisions this week to pull troops from Syria and start planning a drawdown in Afghanistan.

""He has generally been referred to as one of the adults in the Trump administration,"" Australian government Senator Jim Molan told The Australian newspaper.

He said his departure was concerning because it introduced ""another extreme variable"" into U.S. decision making.

Mattis has been a vocal critic of China's increasing presence in the South China Sea but he worked to ensure tensions did not boil over.

""He's been the point of continuity and the gatekeeper in the administration that they've relied on most to temper the instincts of Trump, which are much more, I think, isolationist and clearly highly sceptical ... about alliance commitments,"" said foreign policy and security analyst Euan Graham, executive director of La Trobe Asia at Australia's La Trobe University.

Mattis' departure also robs Australia, without a US ambassador since 2016, of a key ally in the Trump administration.

""Australia has always had the ear of Mattis,"" a US-based diplomatic source told Reuters.

Australia has had roughly 800 troops in the Middle East since 2014, mostly based in Iraq, as part of coalition efforts to combat the Islamic State group.

About 300 troops are based in Afghanistan, where they have had a presence since not long after the war began 17 years ago.

Trump announced on Wednesday that US troops in Syria would be withdrawn, a decision that upended U.S. policy in the region.

A U.S. official said on Thursday Trump was planning to withdraw at least 5,000 of the 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Mattis had advocated for a strong U.S. military presence to bolster diplomatic peace efforts there.

Adam Mount, defence analyst at the Federation of American Scientists, said Mattis was a steady hand on North Korea and was instrumental in preventing a war.

""Mattis was bailing water out of an alliance being buffeted by an erratic president, an advancing North Korea, and an increasingly assertive China,"" Mount said.

""His work kept the alliance afloat but major questions will have to be resolved to keep it strong,"" he said.

Sri Lankan leaders appoint Cabinet after political crisis - Times of India

","
COLOMBO: Sri Lanka's president has appointed 28 lawmakers and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as Cabinet ministers after weeks of political crisis led to government dysfunction.


President Maithripala Sirisena administered oaths Thursday in a private event. Wickremesinghe's reinstatement as prime minister earlier this week and the appointment of a new Cabinet will result in Sri Lanka's government resuming functions that have been obstructed since October.

But continued acrimony between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe means the crisis is far from over.

The crisis began when Sirisena sacked Wickremesinghe and appointed former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa in his place.

Wickremesinghe insisted he was sacked illegally while Rajapaksa failed to secure a majority support in Parliament.

Sirisena dissolved Parliament and called for elections. The Supreme Court declared the actions illegal, forcing the president to reappoint Wickremesinghe.

North Korea says it won’t denuclearize unless US removes threat - Times of India

","
SEOUL: North Korea said on Thursday it will never unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons unless the United States removes its nuclear threat first, a statement that raises further doubts on whether leader Kim Jong Un will ever relinquish an arsenal he may see as his greatest guarantee of survival.


The statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency came amid a deadlock in nuclear negotiations between the United States and North Korea over the sequencing of the denuclearization process and removal of international sanctions.

Kim and President Donald Trump met June 12 in Singapore where they issued a vague goal for the ""complete denuclearization"" of the Korean Peninsula without describing when and how it would occur.

But North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of denuclearization that bears no resemblance to the American definition, vowing to pursue nuclear development until the United States removes its troops and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan. In Thursday's statement, the North reiterated its traditional stance on denuclearization and accused Washington of misleading what had been agreed on in Singapore.

""The United States must now recognize the accurate meaning of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and especially, must study geography the right way,"" the statement said.

""When we talk about the Korean Peninsula, it includes the territory of our republic and also the entire region of (South Korea) where the United States has placed its invasive force, including nuclear weapons. When we talk about the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it means the removal of all sources of nuclear threat, not only from the South and North but also from areas neighboring the Korean Peninsula,"" the statement said.

The US removed its tactical nuclear weapons from South Korea in the 1990s.

The nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang stalled since the Trump-Kim meeting. The United States wants North Korea to provide a detailed account of nuclear and missile facilities that would be inspected and dismantled under a potential deal, while the North is insisting that sanctions be lifted first.

The North Korean statement came a day after Stephen Biegun, the Trump's administration's special envoy on North Korea, told reporters in South Korea that Washington was reviewing easing travel restrictions on North Korea to facilitate humanitarian shipments to help resolve the impasse in nuclear negotiations.

Sri Lanka president Maithripala Sirisena appoints Cabinet after political crisis - Times of India

","
COLOMBO: Sri Lanka's president on Thursday appointed 28 lawmakers and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as Cabinet ministers after weeks of political crisis led to government dysfunction.


President Maithripala Sirisena administered oaths in a private event. Wickremesinghe's reinstatement as prime minister earlier this week and the appointment of a new Cabinet will result in Sri Lanka's government resuming functions that have been obstructed since October, but continued acrimony between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe means the crisis is far from over.

Notably, Sirisena has not appointed a law and order minister, a crucial post for investigating corruption and crime allegations against former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa, his family and government members. Wickremesinghe promised such investigations before the 2015 elections.

Sirisena sparked the crisis in October when he suddenly sacked Wickremesinghe and appointed former President Rajapaksa in his place.

Wickremesinghe insisted he was sacked illegally and hunkered down in the prime minister's official residence in Colombo, while Rajapaksa failed to secure majority support in Parliament in two chaotic no-confidence votes.

Sirisena dissolved Parliament and called for elections. The Supreme Court first suspended the move and later declared the dissolution unconstitutional.

Separately, the Court of Appeal ordered Rajapaksa and his Cabinet to cease functioning. As a result, the newly-restored government in Sri Lanka has only 11 days left to pass a budget to provision state money in 2019.

After reappointing Wickremesinghe, Sirisena made a speech saying he doubted that the new arrangement would last long. Sri Lankans are not due to go to the national polls again until 2020, but if the government fails to function, Parliament can pass a resolution with a 2/3 vote for snap elections.

Sirisena was health minister in Rajapaksa's Cabinet when he defected and joined Wickremesinghe to challenge Rajapaksa in the 2015 presidential election. After victory he formed a government with Wickremesinghe as prime minister but the two disagreed on everything from economic reform to investigating alleged government abuses during Sri Lanka's decades-long civil war.

German court rules Apple infringed Qualcomm patent - Times of India

","
MUNICH/SAN FRANCISCO: A German court ruled on Thursday that iPhone maker Apple Inc infringed a hardware patent of Qualcomm Inc and said the US company could no longer sell some iPhone models in Germany which contain a particular component. 


 The ruling will not go into immediate effect if Apple appeals, judge Matthias Zigann told the court.

 The German case is Qualcomm's third major effort to secure a ban on Apple's lucrative iPhones over patent infringement allegations after similar court efforts in the United States and in China.

 In Germany, Qualcomm is seeking a ban on some iPhones with chips from Intel Corp. The judge ruled that phones that contain a chip from Apple supplier Qorvo Inc violated one of Qualcomm's patents around so-called envelope tracking, a feature that helps mobile phones save battery power while sending and receiving wireless signals.

 ""Competition authorities around the world have repeatedly found Qualcomm's licensing practices unlawful, yet Qualcomm continues to try to achieve the same results through a campaign of patent lawsuits. These lawsuits have been largely unsuccessful, and at best would reduce innovation and raise prices,"" Steven Rodgers, Intel's general counsel, said in a statement.

 Apple and Qorvo were not immediately available for comment.

 Qualcomm sued Apple in the regional court in Munich in July last year, seeking an injunction to halt some iPhone sales in Germany as well as monetary damages. 

 The case is part of a broader court conflict between the two, in which Apple has alleged that Qualcomm engaged in anticompetitive business practices to protect a monopoly on so-called modem chips, which help mobile phones connect to wireless data networks. The US Federal Trade Commission has also sued Qualcomm over its business practices in a case set to go to trial in California next month.

 Qualcomm has alleged in courts around the world that Apple violated its patents and has sought bans on iPhone sales in the United States and China.

 US regulators found Apple infringed one Qualcomm patent but have so far recommended against banning some iPhone sales, but a Chinese court issued a sales ban on some iPhones earlier this month. Apple said its phones remain on sale and that it believes it has complied with the Chinese court's order, but it also made changes to its iPhone software in the wake of the ruling.

UN food program announces service cuts to Palestinians - Times of India

JERUSALEM: The United Nations' World Food Program says it will be cutting services to nearly 200,000 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip due to a lack of funding.


The WFP said in a statement on Wednesday it needs another $57 million to continue providing for 3,60,000 impoverished Palestinians in 2019.

Of those affected by the budget shortages, 27,000 Palestinians in the West Bank will lose food service, and another 166,000 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip will receive reduced services.

Raphael du Boispean, a WFP spokesman, attributed the crisis to the ""recurrent problem"" of declining donations.

The Palestinians have faced major budget cuts this year after the United States slashed funding for the UN's Palestinian refugee program UNRWA and for USAID programs in the Palestinian territories.

Army joins drone hunt after London airport shutdown - Times of India

","
GATWICK AIRPORT (UNITED KINGDOM): Britain called in the army Thursday after dozens of drone sightings grounded all flights from London's Gatwick airport for more than 24 hours, leaving tens of thousands of passengers stranded on one of the busiest days of the year.

The airport, which closed its only runway Wednesday night after ""reports of two drones flying in and around the airfield"", said late Thursday it could not be reopened following further appearances of the devices.

""Gatwick's runway remains unavailable because of continued drone sightings,"" it said in a 11pm (2300 GMT) update.

Police and airport authorities believe they were being flown in a deliberate act to disrupt the airport.

The unusually large drones had been spotted near the airfield more than 50 times over the 24-hour period, police said Thursday night.

""We think it may have been adapted and developed,"" said Detective Chief Superintendent Jason Tingley of the devices, adding officers were reviewing CCTV footage to identify the make and model.

He said firearms officers were now considering shooting the device down -- despite authorities earlier saying that would be dangerous due to the danger of stray bullets.

The runway closure stranded tens of thousands of travellers days before Christmas -- and prompted the unusual military operation.

Specialist equipment has been deployed by the MOD (Ministry of Defence) to Gatwick airport to assist Sussex Police.

""We are there to assist and do everything we can,"" Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson told Sky News television, declining to give the troops' exact role and adding that it followed a request from local police.

Gisele Fenech, 43, who was travelling to Malta, was among those stranded at the airport.

""We're meeting family and it's my daughter's birthday today so it's gone all wrong. We've been looking forward to this for so long,"" she told AFP.

""Everyone's trying to get home for Christmas.""

Gatwick, around 30 miles (50 kilometres) south of the British capital, is the eighth-busiest airport in Europe and sits behind Mumbai as the world's busiest single runway air hub.

Inbound flights were diverted to other airports, including Paris, while passengers waiting to take off faced gruelling delays as airlines cut services.

Easyjet, Gatwick's biggest operator, said it had cancelled all its flights in and out of the hub Thursday.

Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said overnight restrictions would be lifted at some airports to help ease the situation.

Some 10,000 passengers were affected on Wednesday night, and a further 110,000 who had been due to either take off or land at the airport on 760 flights Thursday.

Gatwick said it anticipated disruption to continue into Friday.

Musab Rashid, 22, who was going to Copenhagen, said: ""It's wrong, it's childish of them to do this, because it's affected more than 100,000 people.""

Two drones were first spotted flying over Gatwick at around 9:00 pm (2100 GMT) on Wednesday. The airfield briefly reopened at 3:00 am on Thursday, but had to be closed again following further sightings through the day.

Gatwick CEO Stewart Wingate said the incident was ""a highly targeted activity which has been designed to close the airport and bring maximum disruption in the run up to Christmas"".

""We are working very closely with the police and the security services to try to resolve this for passengers,"" he said, adding ""as soon as we can we will"" reopen the runway.

A cat-and-mouse manhunt is under way to catch those operating the drones, with more than 20 police units and dozens of officers from two local forces deployed.

Police superintendent Justin Burtenshaw said: ""We believe this to be a deliberate act to disrupt the airport. However, there are absolutely no indications to suggest this is terror-related.""

He added: ""Each time we believe we get close to the operator, the drone disappears; when we look to reopen the airfield, the drone reappears.""

British Prime Minister Theresa May said she sympathised with passengers and vowed action.

""We will continue to work with the Gatwick authorities and police will be working... in order to bring this to a close,"" she said at a press conference in London.

Under a new British law, drones cannot be flown near aircraft or within a kilometre of an airport, or at an altitude of over 400 feet (122 metres).

May warned the perpetrators they could face up to five years in prison for endangering an aircraft under recently passed legislation.

""We're consulting on further aspects of this including further police powers,"" she added.

Gatwick serves more than 228 destinations in 74 countries for 45 million passengers a year.

London's Gatwick airport reopens after drone saboteur sows chaos - Times of India

","
LONDON: London's Gatwick Airport reopened on Friday after a saboteur wrought 36 hours of travel chaos for over a hundred thousand Christmas travellers by using a drone to play cat-and-mouse with police snipers and the army.


After the biggest disruption at Gatwick, Britain's second busiest airport, since a volcanic ash cloud in 2010, Gatwick said 700 planes were due to take off on Friday, although there would still be delays and cancellations.

Britain deployed unidentified military technology to guard the airport against what Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said were thought to be several drones.

""What's happening on the ground is a mix of measures taken to give confidence that aircraft can be safe... Some of those are military capabilities,"" Grayling told BBC television.

Grayling said there was not yet ""a straightforward commercial, off-the-shelf solution that automatically solves all problems.""

There was mystery over the motivation of the drone operator, or operators, and police said there was nothing to suggest the crippling of one of Europe's busiest airports was a terrorist attack.

Gatwick's drone nightmare is thought to be the most disruptive yet at a major airport and indicates a new vulnerability that will be scrutinised by security forces and airport operators across the world.

The army and police snipers were called in to hunt down the drones, thought to be industrial style craft, which flew near the airport every time it tried to reopen on Thursday.

CHAOS

Gatwick's chief operating officer Chris Woodroofe said the perpetrator had not yet been found.

Flights were halted at 2103 GMT on Wednesday after two drones were spotted near the airfield. The disruption affected at least 120,000 people.

It was not immediately clear what the financial impact would be on the main airlines who operate from Gatwick including easyJet and British Airways.

After a boom in drone sales, unmanned aerial vehicles have become a growing menace at airports across the world.

In Britain, the number of near misses between private drones and aircraft more than tripled between 2015 and 2017, with 92 incidents recorded last year.

Flying drones within 1 km (0.6 mile) of a British airport boundary is punishable by five years in prison.

The drone sightings caused misery for tens of thousands of travellers who were stranded at Gatwick, many sleeping on the floor as they searched for alternative routes to holidays and Christmas family gatherings.

""There's no evidence that it is terror-related in the conventional sense,"" Grayling said. ""But it's clearly a kind of disruptive activity that we've not seen before. This kind of incident is unprecedented anywhere in the world.""

He said it was uncertain how many drones were involved but it appeared to be more than one.

""It's thought to be a small number of drones in the plural,"" Grayling said. ""It certainly wasn't a lot, it was the same small number of drones seen many times.""

Donald Trump throws Kabul, New Delhi under the bus with Afghan withdrawal move 

","
WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump is ordering an American drawdown in Afghanistan, bringing home some 50 per cent of the 15,000 US troops over the next two months. The move will effectively throw the Afghan government under the bus, and beyond that, endanger Indian presence, investment, and stakes in the country, since it is expected to open the floodgates for the return of Taliban and other Pakistani terrorist proxies. 


Trump’s decision to start withdrawing from Afghanistan, which even some American experts described as a defeat, comes on the heels of a similar 

  departure from Syria he announced abruptly over Twitter
 + on Tuesday. The twin disengagements, which are in keeping with the non-interventionist outlook he often expressed during his Presidential campaign and after, led to the resignation on Thursday of Defense Secretary James Mattis. 




US defence secretary Jim Mattis quits as Trump announces Syria withdrawalUS defence secretary Jim Mattis quit Thursday as President Donald Trump weathered an escalating backlash at home and abroad over his sudden decision to pull all troops from Syria. Trump steadfastly defended the withdrawal of the 2,000-strong force from Syria, vowing that the United States would no longer be the ""policeman of the Middle East"".


Trump falsely tweeted that Mattis was “retiring,” but the General, who was sometimes referred to as the only adult in cabinet who could counsel the mercurial President, sent a resignation letter that laid bare their differences, including the broader issue of treatment of allies and the real threats to the United States.



General Jim Mattis will be retiring, with distinction, at the end of February, after having served my Administratio… https://t.co/PqB9L51hvN— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1545344467000

“My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues,” Mattis wrote. “We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances,” he added, clearly implying Trump was not doing it. 

“Because you have the right to a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position,” the departing Defense Secretary, who met his Indian counterpart Nirmala Sitharaman four times this year for talks, said. 

The US President remained unconcerned even as the foreign policy and strategic establishments had a meltdown in the hours after announcement, as he battled to secure funding for a border wall from the Congress in the face of a looming government shutdown, engendering jokes that the greatest military in the world was good for only tackling refugees and asylum-seekers. 

“Getting out of Syria was no surprise. I’ve been campaigning on it for years, and six months ago, when I very publicly wanted to do it, I agreed to stay longer. Russia, Iran, Syria & other are the local enemy of ISIS. We were doing [their] work. Time to come home & rebuild,” he explained over Twitter, as he was excoriated by even Republican lawmakers and many conservative talking heads, save a few isolationists. 

Trump did not refer to the Afghanistan drawndown, but he asked, “Does the USA want to be the Policeman of the Middle East, getting NOTHING but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who, in almost all cases, do not appreciate what we are doing? Do we want to be there forever?”



Does the USA want to be the Policeman of the Middle East, getting NOTHING but spending precious lives and trillions… https://t.co/fNDrsdz1RJ— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1545307014000

The US involvement in Afghanistan has lasted 17 years and Trump has often expressed doubts about the utility of American troops there, evidently untutored over the 1990s vacuum that led to the rise of the Al Qaida and the 9/11 catastrophe, which has been the basis for the interventionist argument espoused by the likes of Mattis and other top US Generals, as also many leading US Senators, including Republicans. 

“The conditions in Afghanistan – at the present moment – make American troop withdrawals a high risk strategy. If we continue on our present course we are setting in motion the loss of all our gains and paving the way toward a second 9/11,” warned Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a key Trump ally on the domestic front.

The Afghan drawdown became imminent the moment Trump announced the Syria withdrawal with many analysts turning their attention to the fertile ground that gave rise to Al Qaeda and 9/11 much before ISIS appeared on the scene.

“How do you think the US precipitous withdrawal in Syria is viewed by the Taliban? The Taliban must smell blood in the water. Why would it compromise when it sees the US so eager to leave? Since when is negotiating from a position of weakness (the US) considered a clever tactic?” asked Bill Roggio of the Long War Journal, referring to recent US efforts to negotiate with the Taliban often without keeping Kabul in the loop.

Others recorded yet another episode of American inconsistency and unreliability. “If stories about US drawdown from #Afghanistan are true, Pres Trump will have done exactly what Pres Obama did: Send troops in, only to withdraw them prematurely, thereby proving the #Taliban’s maxim: Americans have watches, we have time,” Husain Haqqani, Pakistan’s former ambassador to the US, noted sagely.

Jinnah House in Mumbai belongs to Pakistan: Foreign Office - Times of India

","
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan asserted on Thursday that Jinnah House in Mumbai belonged to it and any attempt by India to take the building under its control will not be accepted, days after External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said her ministry is in the process of getting the bungalow transferred in its name. 



The sea-facing bungalow on Malabar Hill in Mumbai was designed by architect Claude Batley in European style and Pakistan's founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah lived there in the late 1930s. Pakistan had demanded in recent years that the property should be handed over to it for housing its Mumbai consulate. 

""We have a claim over it (Jinnah House) and we do not accept that anyone tries to take custody of it. They (Indians) have already accepted that it belongs to Pakistan. We have record of it. They (Indians) have accepted that it belong to Pakistan,"" Foreign Office spokesperson Mohammad Faisal told reporters here. 

Asked if Pakistan would consider to hand over Kartarpur land to India in a swap deal, Faisal said: ""Absolutely not...It is gesture for Sikh minority community made on their request to provide a visa free corridor to facilitate visit to a religious shrine."" 

He said the decision to open the Kartarpur corridor was taken at the state-to-state level and the Indian government was fully involved in it. 

In a letter to Mumbai city BJP legislator Mangal Prabhat Lodha, Swaraj said Prime Minister's Office has instructed to renovate and refurbish Jinnah House to develop it on the pattern of facilities available in Hyderabad House in Delhi. 

""Accordingly, approval of the PMO was sought for transfer of the property from ICCR (Indian Council for Cultural Relations) to our ministry. PMO has now accorded necessary approvals,"" Swaraj said in her letter. 

The letter, dated December 5, further said, ""We are in the process of transferring the ownership in our name."" 

Jinnah's daughter Dina Wadia had in August 2007 approached the Bombay High Court claiming that being the sole legal heir of Jinnah, she should get the possession of the house. After her death, her son and Wadia Group chairman Nusli Neville Wadia is carrying on the litigation. 

Commenting on the release of Indian prisoner Hamid Nihal Ansari, Faisal said Ansari ""illegally entered Pakistan and was arrested for spying and convicted"". 

""On completion of his sentence he was repatriated as per law of the land (Pakistan),"" he said. 

He also said that release of Ansari would not have any impact on the Kashmir policy of Pakistan. 

Responding to a question about media reports regarding support sought by the Khalistan movement from Pakistan, Faisal said, ""Please note it and register it with you...Pakistan does not interfere in internal affairs of any country."" 

Faisal also condemned the violence in Kashmir and alleged that India was committing ceasefire violations at Line of Control to divert the world's attention. 

He said Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi wrote letters to the UN secretary general and OIC secretary general to highlight the recent violence in Kashmir. 

 On Afghan peace talks, he said that talks between the Taliban and the US were held in Abu Dhabi. 

 ""Our leadership has conveyed unequivocal support to both Afghan leadership and the international community of for an Afghan-led Afghan-owned peace process,"" he said. 

 ""Pakistan played a role as part of share responsibility in the meeting held in the UAE for peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan. Our role has been widely recognised and appreciated. I do not want to say any more about it at this stage,"" he said. 

Faisal also rejected impression that Pakistan controlled the Taliban. 

""We have always stated that Pakistan exercises limited influence over the Taliban...We cannot respond as to when the next round of negotiations between the US and Taliban will take place,"" he said.

Trump signs bill on Tibet into law despite China protest - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump has signed a bipartisan bill on Tibet into law that could enrage China, paving the way to impose a visa ban on Chinese officials who deny American citizens, government officials and journalists access to the sensitive Himalayan region, homeland of the exiled Dalai Lama.


US citizens including government officials, reporters and tourists who seek to enter Tibetan areas are routinely rejected, and the few who do get in are forced to stay on strictly controlled official tours, where the true situation of the Tibetan people is hidden from them, officials said.

The situation is worst of all for Tibetan-Americans, who are almost and always denied the right to make a pilgrimage to their ancestral land and to meet their family members there, community members said.

The Wednesday's move by President Trump came days after China lodged a 'stern' diplomatic protest with the US over the Senate passing the legislation with Beijing asking Washington not to make it a law.

China insists Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries. The Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 amid an abortive uprising against the Chinese rule in his Himalayan homeland.

The White House said that Trump signed into law the 'Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018' which promotes access for diplomats, officials, journalists and others from the United States to China's Tibetan areas.

The bill, which was earlier passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives, seeks to impose a visa ban on Chinese officials who deny American citizens, government officials and journalists access to the remote region of Tibet.

The move also comes amidst Trump administration imposing massive trade import duties on China, the world's second largest after that of America.

However, the bill includes a national security waiver and would require the Secretary of State to submit an assessment to Congress of the level of access to Tibet granted to US officials, journalists and tourists by China.

If the Secretary of State determines that there are restrictions on travel to Tibet, the appropriate Chinese officials will be ineligible to enter the US.

The Tibetan community described it as a historic moment for them.

'Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act becomes law, marking new era of American support for Tibet', said International Campaign for Tibet (ICT).

""This is truly a turning point for Americans, Tibetans and all who care about equality, justice and human rights,"" said Matteo Mecacci, ICT president.

""By passing this impactful and innovative law, the US has blazed a path for other countries to follow and let the Chinese government know that it will face real consequences for its discrimination against the Tibetan people,"" he said.

Congressman Jim McGovern, who introduced the bill in the House of Representatives, said: ""I'm glad that the President signed our bill, the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act, into law.

""For too long, China has covered up their human rights violations in Tibet by restricting travel. But actions have consequences and today we are one step closer to holding the Chinese officials who implement these restrictions accountable"".

McGovern said he looks forward to watching closely as the law is implemented, and continuing to stand with the people of Tibet in their struggle for religious and cultural freedom.

The Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act is based on the diplomatic principle of reciprocity, which calls on countries to give equal rights to one another's citizens.

Sponsors of the bill alleged that when it comes to Tibet, China does not reciprocate. Although Chinese citizens travel freely throughout the US, Chinese authorities severely restrict Americans' ability to access Tibet.

""The Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act specifically highlights the discriminatory attitude of Chinese officials toward Tibetan-Americans who seek to visit Tibet.

""The Chinese embassy and consulates routinely place such Tibetan-Americans under a more stringent and non-consular application process merely because they are of Tibetan-origin. This includes subjecting them to vigorous interviews by United Front officials, collecting personal and family information and eventually denying them access,"" ICT vice president Bhuchung K Tsering said.

The ICT said until now, China has been able to use its economic and military power to isolate Tibet without much resistance from the international community. With reciprocal access to Tibet becoming law, China will begin to feel the weight of its unfair policies.

The law requires the Secretary of State to assess Americans' level of access to Tibet within 90 days of its enactment and to send a report to Congress every year afterward identifying the Chinese officials responsible for keeping Americans out of Tibet.

The Secretary will then ban those officials from receiving visas to enter the US.

'Turn yourselves in,' Pope Francis to priestly sex abusers - Times of India

","
VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis vowed Friday that the Catholic Church will ""never again"" cover up clergy sex abuse and demanded that priests who have raped and molested children turn themselves in.


Francis dedicated his annual Christmas speech to the Vatican bureaucracy to abuse, evidence that a year of devastating revelations of sexual misconduct and cover-up has shaken his papacy and caused a crisis of confidence in the Catholic hierarchy.

Francis acknowledged that the church in the past had failed to treat the problem seriously, blaming leaders who out of inexperience or short-sightedness acted ""irresponsibly"" by refusing to believe victims. But he vowed that going forward the church would ""never again"" cover up or dismiss cases.

""Let it be clear that before these abominations the church will spare no effort to do all that is necessary to bring to justice whosoever has committed such crimes,"" he said.

Francis urged victims to come forward, thanked the media for giving them a voice and issued a stark warning to abusers: ""Convert and hand yourself over to human justice, and prepare for divine justice.""

Francis' remarks capped a dreadful year for the Catholic Church, one that began with his own botched handling of a sprawling sex abuse scandal in Chile and ended with the U.S. hierarchy in a free-fall of credibility as state prosecutors have begun uncovering decades of cover-up.

Francis has summoned church leaders from around the globe for a February abuse prevention summit, in an indication that he has come to realize that the problem is far greater and far more global than he had understood at the start of his pontificate five years ago.

Francis' demand that abusers turn themselves in to face ``human justice'' was significant, and echoed his previous demands for mafia bosses and corrupt politicians to convert.

Vatican guidelines currently only call for bishops to report priestly abusers to police in those countries where civil law requires it — a technicality that survivors and their advocates have long blasted as a convenient dodge to the church's moral obligation to protect children regardless of what the law requires.

Francis warned the Vatican bureaucrats who run the 1.2 billion strong Church that the scandal now undermines the credibility of the entire Catholic enterprise and that from now on the church and all its pastors must embark on a continuous path of purification.

He prayed for help so that the Church can discern true cases from false ones, and accusations from slander.

""This is no easy task, since the guilty are capable of skillfully covering their tracks,'' and choosing victims who will keep silent.

It was perhaps a veiled reference to ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the disgraced retired archbishop of Washington who is now facing a canonical trial on allegations he groped a teenage altar boy in the 1970s.

The McCarrick revelations have fueled the crisis in confidence in the U.S. and Vatican hierarchy since it was apparently an open secret that he slept with seminarians but nevertheless was allowed to rise to the heights of church power.

Francis' reference to the difficulty in distinguishing allegation from slander was also perhaps a reference to his own failure to believe Chilean victims of a notorious predator priest.

During Francis' disastrous trip to Chile in January, he dismissed survivors' allegations of cover-up as ""slander,'' sparking outrage in Chile and beyond. Francis eventually did an about-face, apologized to the victims and acknowledged he had made ""grave errors in judgment'' about the case.

Going forward, he urged those who have been victims of sexual abuse, abuse of power and abuse of conscience to speak out.

``The church asks that people not be silent, but bring it objectively to light, since the greater scandal in this matter is that of cloaking the truth,'' he said.

The cardinals and bishops of the Curia listened attentively, including the dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, who has long been blamed for the Vatican's refusal to acknowledge the depth of the problem during the quarter-century pontificate of St. John Paul II.

Sodano, who was John Paul's deputy, made no mention of the scandal that has convulsed the church this year. In his introductory remarks Friday to the pope, he instead thanked Francis for his pastoral visits in Rome, Italy and around the world, for having canonized Pope Paul VI and for having issued a new teaching document.

In previous years, Francis has used his Christmas greetings to issue blistering criticisms of the failings of the Curia, accusing them of suffering from ""spiritual Alzheimer's"" and taking part in the ``terrorism of gossip.''

His remarks this year had a more global outlook, noting that all around there are priests who ``without batting an eye'' are ready to betray all that the church stands for and enter into a ""web of corruption'' by abusing those in their care.

``Often behind their boundless amiability, impeccably activity and angelic faces, they shamelessly conceal a vicious wolf ready to devour innocent souls,"" he said.

US fundraising site suspends Palestinian boycott account - Times of India

","
JERUSALEM: A US software company said Friday it blocked the fundraising account of the Palestinian-led boycott movement against Israel following a complaint by a pro-Israel group that the campaign has links to militant groups.


Donorbox, which makes fundraising management software, confirmed that the BDS campaign's account was temporarily blocked while it investigates the allegations. The BDS movement called the Israeli move ""McCarthyite.''

The decision came in response to a complaint from Shurat HaDin, an Israeli advocacy group that files lawsuits around the world against Israel's foes, submitted in coordination with Israel's Strategic Affairs Ministry.

""This decision does not mean that we consider BDS to be a nefarious organization. We are merely reviewing evidence following this complaint. Their donation forms were closed as a precautionary measure,'' Donorbox said in a statement. The San Francisco firm, whose product is used by BDS and other nonprofits to collect online donations, gave no indication how long the review would take.

The complaint noted that the boycott movement's membership includes the ""Council of National and Islamic Forces in Palestine,'' an umbrella committee representing all major Palestinian political factions. Committee members include Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, groups that have been branded terrorist organizations by the US.

The council, also known as the PNIF, was formed two decades ago and rarely meets due to deep divisions among its members.

""We have no intention to allow terrorist organizations and their accomplices to raise money online without interference,'' said Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, president of Shurat HaDin.

Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan, whose office is spearheading Israel's battle against the boycott movement, called the decision ""a significant achievement in our efforts to counter the discriminatory BDS campaign.''

The BDS campaign advocates boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israeli businesses, universities and artists. Comparing itself to the anti-apartheid movement during apartheid-era South Africa, it says it is using nonviolent means to resist unjust policies toward Palestinians. The group has made significant gains in recent years, particularly among artists and university students.

Israel says the movement masks its motives to delegitimize or destroy the Jewish state.

Supporters of Israel have passed a series of anti-BDS laws in the US. The American Civil Liberties Union is currently challenging a Texas law requiring contractors to certify that they do not boycott Israel or Israeli-occupied territories, saying it violates the right to free speech.

Omar Barghouti, a founder of the BDS movement, called Shurat HaDin a ""repressive organization with clear connections to the far-right Israeli government'' that is ""engaging in McCarthyite ... tactics.''

""They are making categorically false allegations, threatening and bullying our partners and service providers in a desperate attempt to undermine our ability to challenge Israel's regime of apartheid and oppression,'' he said. ``While this legal repression may temporarily burden us, it has failed to deter us from continuing our peaceful anti-racist and inclusive struggle for freedom, justice and equality.''

Bangladesh opposition goes underground as election threats grow - Times of India

","
DHAKA: Subrata Chowdhury, an opposition candidate in the looming Bangladesh election, is too scared to leave his party office as campaign deaths and threats mount.


The Dhaka lawyer should be out on the streets handing out leaflets on meet-and-greets. But he says it is too dangerous while his party insists authorities are doing nothing to protect candidates.

""We were attacked by ruling party men as we tried to hang these posters,"" said Chowdhury in his glum headquarters amid stacks of unused flyers and banners.

""The police were just silent spectators, or actively supported them.""

At least six people have been killed in campaign clashes between Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ruling Awami League and the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).

Election authorities have deployed more than 20,000 paramilitary personnel across the country to boost security ahead of the December 30 vote. Army troops are due to join them.

But the BNP is not reassured.

It says at least four party activists have been killed- including one who fell to his death from a Dhaka rooftop last week in suspicious circumstances- and thousands hurt in the past week.

The party claims that 152 out of 300 opposition candidates have been attacked while campaigning and more than 8,700 activists, including 14 candidates, have been detained in the past month.

The opposition says its rallies have been broken up by police firing pellet guns and tear gas, terrifying voters turning out to show solidarity with the beleaguered movement.

Candidates like Chowdhury, trying to boost their visibility, have been threatened on the campaign trail by ruling Awami League followers wielding metal bars.

Two Awami League followers have also been killed in fights with the opposition.

Police have denied interfering in rallies or harassing opposition campaigners and authorities say those detained in recent weeks- which opposition figures say are in the thousands- had outstanding warrants for their arrest.

Obaidul Quader, general secretary of the Awami League, said the party did not tell its workers to attack opponents.

""I won't say all (the allegations) are false. But... we did not give any order,"" he said.

The Election Commission says it has taken steps to ensure a level playing field- despite the overwhelming number of opposition candidates disqualified.

But alarm has been growing as the poll looms.

Rights groups and government critics warn the election is not shaping up to be free or fair in the country of 160 million.

""Members and supporters of the main opposition parties have been arrested, killed, even disappeared, creating an atmosphere of fear and repression that is not consistent with credible elections,"" said Brad Adams, Asia director for New York-based Human Rights Watch.

There are fears of a repeat of the one-sided 2014 national election -- when the BNP boycotted the vote, letting Hasina walk into office unchallenged.

Since then, Hasina and her party have been accused of drifting toward authoritarianism, silencing dissent and the press by using an onerous digital-security law.

Critics, notably award-winning photojournalist Shahidul Alam, were jailed for making ""provocative"" statements.

The opposition's veteran opposition leader Khaleda Zia was handed another stiff jail term in November, ensuring she was kept out of the race.

The browbeating has left voters wondering if there is an alternative to the governing party.

""It's a one-sided poll so far. The opposition is too afraid to campaign,"" said Rezaur Rahman, a voter from West Nakhalpara in the capital Dhaka.

The streets of West Nakhalpara are plastered with images of the incumbent, a ruling party minister whose supporters have staged noisy parades.

His challenger -- head of an opposition youth league -- remains all but invisible.

""I doubt the opposition is even contesting the polls,"" said one shopkeeper, who declined to be name for fear of retribution.

""I haven't seen any of his posters or leaflets. No one came to me seeking a vote for him.""

Opposition candidates say the odds are stacked against them.

""They claim the people are with them. Then why aren't they letting everyone campaign freely?"" asked BNP candidate Afroza Abbas, whose motorcade was attacked last week.

Pakistan government to file disqualification case against former President Zardari - Times of India

","
ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan government plans to file a case before the Election Commission against former President Asif Ali Zardari, seeking his disqualification over concealment of assets in the US, information minister Fawad Chaudhry said on Wednesday.


Chaudhry accused Zardari of failing to mention an apartment he allegedly owns in the US in a declaration submitted to the Election Commission of Pakistan.

He said the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government will soon file a reference against Zardari for not declaring the property in his nomination papers.

""He [Zardari] was required to declare that property under Articles 62 and 63, which he didn't. He is therefore not eligible to be a lawmaker,"" he was quoted as saying by the Dawn newspaper.

Chaudhry said the investigative agencies were given a ""free hand"" to investigate any politician — regardless of the party they belonged to — whose activities are found to be suspicious.

Zardari, 63, served as the 11th President of Pakistan from 2008 to 2013.

In July, Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) declared 20 suspects, including Zardari and his sister, as absconders in a Rs 35 billion money laundering case.

Third Canadian was held for working in China illegally - Times of India

","
BEIJING: The third Canadian detained in China is being held for working illegally in the country, the Chinese foreign ministry said Thursday amid diplomatic tensions over the previous two detentions on national security grounds.


The Canadian, a woman named Sarah McIver, faces ""administrative penalties"", said Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying at a press briefing in Beijing, without specifying what the penalties entail. 

Canada's National Post newspaper has identified McIver as a teacher from Alberta.

Hua said that McIver's case is different from the previous two detentions, which were carried out by China's state security apparatus.

McIver is being held by a local public security bureau, said Hua.

On December 10, former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and China-based business consultant Michael Spavor were both detained and accused of engaging in activities ""that endanger China's national security"".

The detention of the three Canadians comes against a backdrop of escalating tensions between China and Canada, which arrested Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wangzhou on December 1.

Meng was released on bail last week in Vancouver pending a US extradition hearing on US fraud charges related to sanctions-breaking business dealings with Iran.

'State support for terrorist proxies will not be tolerated': US's veiled warning to Pakistan - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: The US has told all its regional partners, including Pakistan, that state support for terrorist proxies will not be tolerated, the Pentagon has said, expressing concern over the free movement of some militant groups in Pakistan that are presenting security challenges for Afghanistan.


The Pentagon, in its semi-annual Afghan report to the US Congress that covers the period of June to November 2018, said on Thursday that Taliban and the Haqqani Network retain freedom of movement in Pakistan.

The Pentagon's remarks came amidst reports that President Donald Trump is planning to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan.

In the report, the Pentagon said that Afghanistan faces a continuing threat from an externally supported insurgency and the highest regional concentration of terrorist groups in the world.

""In this reporting period, the US continued to call on regional partners to reinforce our messages that state support for terrorist proxies will not be tolerated, that cross-border cooperation between Afghanistan and Pakistan is essential, and that the Taliban cannot achieve its objectives through continued military conflict,"" the Pentagon said.

""Although Pakistani military operations have disrupted some militant sanctuaries, certain groups — such as the Taliban and the Haqqani Network — retain freedom of movement in Pakistan. The United States continues to convey to all levels of Pakistani leadership the importance of taking action against all terrorist and militant groups,"" it said.

According to the report, the Haqqani network continues to be an integral part of the Taliban's effort to pressure the Afghan government in Kabul and eastern Afghanistan.

Sirajuddin Haqqani's role as a Taliban deputy probably increased Haqqani influence within the Taliban leadership, and resulted in an increase in Haqqani influence to areas outside its normal operating areas of Paktika, Paktiya, and Khost provinces in eastern Afghanistan, it said.

The Afghanistan-Pakistan border region remains a sanctuary for various groups, including the Taliban, al-Qaeda core (AQ), al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), the Haqqani Network (HQN), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), ISIS-K, East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU).

Terrorist sanctuaries on both sides of the border present security challenges for Afghanistan and Pakistan and pose a threat to regional security and stability, the report said.

The South Asia Strategy, which was announced by Trump in August 2017, has focused on pressuring Pakistan to limit support and safe-haven for proxy terrorist and militant groups and to play a constructive role in facilitating Afghan reconciliation, the Pentagon said.

""Regional efforts in the South Asia Strategy aim to expand burden sharing, neutralize potential spoilers to US and coalition efforts, limit threats to the United States and our allies and partners, and develop and support a durable political settlement in Afghanistan,"" the Pentagon said.

The South Asia strategy prioritises regional engagement to limit hedging against the Afghan government and create an international consensus for peace.

The Pentagon said the existence of more than 20 terrorist or insurgent groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan requires an Afghan-supported US platform in the region to monitor, contain, and respond to these threats.

UAE to deposit $3 billion in Pakistan central bank to help Islamabad's economic woes - Times of India

","
ABU DHABI: The United Arab Emirates will deposit $3 billion in the central bank of Pakistan to help ""enhance liquidity"" as the country struggles with a balance of payments crisis, state media said Friday.


The transfer of 11 billion dirhams by the government-owned Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD) is expected to be carried out in the ""coming days"", the WAM news agency said.

Quoting a statement from the ADFD, the state news agency said the amount is meant ""to support the financial and monetary policy of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan"".

It will ""enhance liquidity and monetary reserves of foreign currency"" at the central bank, it added.

Pakistan is facing a widening balance of payments crisis. The rupee plunged almost five percent to a record low at the end of November, after what appeared to be a sixth devaluation by the central bank in the past year.

A team from the International Monetary Fund in November visited Pakistan for talks with officials on a possible IMF bailout but the discussions ended without any agreement.

Pakistan a regular borrower from the IMF since the 1980s — last received an IMF bailout in 2013 to the tune of $6.6 billion.

It also secured $6 billion in funding from Saudi Arabia and struck a 12-month deal for a cash lifeline during Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan's visit to the kingdom in October.

Khan thanked the UAE on Friday ""for supporting Pakistan so generously in our testing times"".

""This reflects our commitment and friendship that has remained steadfast over the years,"" he said on Twitter.

The UAE announcement came days after Pakistan attended reconciliation talks between the United States and Taliban officials from Afghanistan hosted by the wealthy Gulf state in Abu Dhabi.

Islamabad has also received billions of dollars in Chinese loans to finance ambitious infrastructure projects.

Boy, 9, wins battle to overturn 100-year-old ban on snowball fights in Colorado town - Times of India

","
LOS ANGELES: A nine-year-old boy in Colorado this week threw his first snowball -- legally -- after a battle to overturn a century-old ordinance banning snowball fights in the small town of Severance.

Dane Best said he decided to take on local authorities and persuade them to change the law by using simple logic.

""Today's kids need reasons to play outside,"" Best said on Monday as he appeared before the town trustees, local media reported.

""Research suggests that a lack of exposure to the outdoors can lead to obesity, ADHD, anxiety and depression.""

He said the nearly 100-year-old measure, which bans throwing any stone or missile, including snowballs, was outdated and meant any kids throwing snowballs were breaking the law.

""The children of Severance want an opportunity to have a snowball fight like the rest of the world,"" Dane told the trustees. ""Kids want to have snowball fights without breaking the law. Kids want to have a voice in our town.""

His arguments won over the board, which unanimously voted to tweak the ordinance to allow snowball fights.

After the vote, the town mayor offered Dane his first snowball to throw legally.

The boy said his little brother would be his first target and that he would avoid breaking windows.

US fundraising site suspends Palestinian boycott account - Times of India

","
JERUSALEM: A US software company said Friday it blocked the fundraising account of the Palestinian-led boycott movement against Israel following a complaint by a pro-Israel group that the campaign has links to militant groups.


Donorbox, which makes fundraising management software, confirmed that the BDS campaign's account was temporarily blocked while it investigates the allegations. The BDS movement called the Israeli move ""McCarthyite.''

The decision came in response to a complaint from Shurat HaDin, an Israeli advocacy group that files lawsuits around the world against Israel's foes, submitted in coordination with Israel's Strategic Affairs Ministry.

""This decision does not mean that we consider BDS to be a nefarious organization. We are merely reviewing evidence following this complaint. Their donation forms were closed as a precautionary measure,'' Donorbox said in a statement. The San Francisco firm, whose product is used by BDS and other nonprofits to collect online donations, gave no indication how long the review would take.

The complaint noted that the boycott movement's membership includes the ""Council of National and Islamic Forces in Palestine,'' an umbrella committee representing all major Palestinian political factions. Committee members include Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, groups that have been branded terrorist organizations by the US.

The council, also known as the PNIF, was formed two decades ago and rarely meets due to deep divisions among its members.

""We have no intention to allow terrorist organizations and their accomplices to raise money online without interference,'' said Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, president of Shurat HaDin.

Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan, whose office is spearheading Israel's battle against the boycott movement, called the decision ""a significant achievement in our efforts to counter the discriminatory BDS campaign.''

The BDS campaign advocates boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israeli businesses, universities and artists. Comparing itself to the anti-apartheid movement during apartheid-era South Africa, it says it is using nonviolent means to resist unjust policies toward Palestinians. The group has made significant gains in recent years, particularly among artists and university students.

Israel says the movement masks its motives to delegitimize or destroy the Jewish state.

Supporters of Israel have passed a series of anti-BDS laws in the US. The American Civil Liberties Union is currently challenging a Texas law requiring contractors to certify that they do not boycott Israel or Israeli-occupied territories, saying it violates the right to free speech.

Omar Barghouti, a founder of the BDS movement, called Shurat HaDin a ""repressive organization with clear connections to the far-right Israeli government'' that is ""engaging in McCarthyite ... tactics.''

""They are making categorically false allegations, threatening and bullying our partners and service providers in a desperate attempt to undermine our ability to challenge Israel's regime of apartheid and oppression,'' he said. ``While this legal repression may temporarily burden us, it has failed to deter us from continuing our peaceful anti-racist and inclusive struggle for freedom, justice and equality.''

Boeing lands jet deals with Nigeria, Saudi for $9.3 billion - Times of India

","
PARIS: US planemaker Boeing on Friday said it had agreed to deals worth an overall $9.3 billion to sell 50 jets to Nigeria's Green Air and 30 to Saudi carrier flyadeal.


The company lauded the Nigeria accord, which includes a further 50 options, as the largest signed to date in Africa.

As with the Saudi deal, the Nigerians are purchasing single-aisle 737 MAX planes.

""While flyadeal has been operating new Airbus A320s, the airline says it has selected the 737 MAX for the future,"" Boeing said in a statement.

The firm noted its first deliveries to Saudi Arabia were in 1945, as those DC-3 aircraft ""gave birth to commercial air travel in the kingdom"".

Flyeadeal is a subsidiary of Saudi Arabian Airlines and flies to a range of domestic destinations across the kingdom.

Boeing quoted the director general of Saudi Arabian Airlines, Saleh bin Nasser Al-Jasser, as saying: ""The demand for air transport services in the domestic market of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has grown exponentially,"" adding flyadeal had ambitions eventually to ""cover new markets outside of Saudi Arabia"".

The flyadeal is for the 189-seater 737 MAX 8, whose operating costs Boeing said was eight per cent lower than the carrier's current fleet of Airbus A320s.

If all the purchase options are exercised, the two deals unveiled Friday will be worth around $17.6 billion at list prices.

Green Airways owner Babawande Afolabi said the Nigerian end of the deal was a strong sign of growing African entrepreneurial dynamism and resilience.

Boeing saw that deal as a step towards construction of a ""solid"" Pan-African network, adding the Africa aviation sector has ""exceptional"" potential.

Since launching the 737 MAX Boeing said it has received more than 4,800 orders from more than 100 customers worldwide.

European rival Airbus said earlier this month it had 380 net orders for planes from January to November with 673 deliveries over that period.

Boeing said it had landed 631 orders between January and September.

US Senate passes bill to avert shutdown - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: The US Senate has approved a legislation to temporarily fund the government in an effort to avoid a partial shutdown just before Christmas after President Donald Trump backed away from his demand for money for a border wall with Mexico.


Senators on Wednesday passed the measure, which would keep government running to 8 February.

The House of Representatives needs to pass similar bill to avoid a government shutdown this weekend. House, in which the Republicans currently has a majority, is expected to pass the bill, but unlikely to include funding for the border wall.

Unless the issue is resolved, more than 800,000 federal workers would face furloughs or be forced to work without pay, disrupting government operations days before Christmas.

Democratic Leader and Speaker-designate, Nancy Pelosi, said her party would support the bill to avert government shutdown. The House is likely to pass the bill on Thursday, before it heads to the President Donald Trump to sign it into law.

Trump said in an Oval Office meeting with top congressional Democratic leaders last week that he would be ""proud"" to shut down part of the government in service of forcing Congress to give him the full $5 billion he wants for a border wall.

The administration appeared to soften its stance on Tuesday when White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Fox News, ""At the end of the day we don't want to shut down the government.""

The border wall was central to Trump's presidential campaign.

""The American people know the president's wall is ineffective, expensive, and only serves as a political bone to his most conservative supporters – certainly not worth a government shutdown,"" Senator Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader, said.

""It's good that Republicans in the Senate finally realised that they should not shut down the government over a wall that does not have enough support to pass the House or Senate and is not supported by a majority of the country,"" Schumer said.

""It is unfortunate that Trump's demand for a border wall from sea to shining sea has held up seven appropriations bills that have been debated and passed out of committee on a bipartisan basis,"" said Senator Dick Durbin.

China to conduct detailed project report for Kathmandu monorail - Times of India

","
KATHMANDU: Nepal on Wednesday signed an agreement with a Chinese state-run construction company for conducting a detailed project report for a 27-km monorail project in the capital city of Kathmandu, an official said.


Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) mayor Bidya Sundar Shakya and China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC) director of overseas business management department Zhao Guangbing signed the Memorandum of Understanding here, a top official said.

CRCC's China Railway 25th Bureau Group Corporation Limited will complete the Detailed Project Report (DPR) within a year.

According to the preliminary study report, the proposed monorail along Kathmandu's 27 km ring road would cost an estimated Rs 116 billion (USD 1.03 billion).

The Chinese company said that the project will be completed within three years after submitting the DPR, KMC's deputy mayor Hari Prabha Khadgi Shrestha said.

""It is the beginning of a long-term project in Nepal and first of its kind. We will do our best to make it successful,"" Zhao said.

Based on the agreement, the Chinese company will bear all the expenses for the DPR.

The contract for the railway project would be awarded through open competition under the Build, Own and Operate (BOOT) model, Shakya said.

Britain calls in army as drones paralyse Gatwick - Times of India

","
GATWICK AIRPORT: Britain called in the army on Thursday to help police hunt a drone pilot who grounded all flights from Gatwick airport, leaving thousands stranded on one of the busiest days of the year. 


The airport closed its only runway late Wednesday following ""reports of two drones flying in and around the airfield"" and further sightings on Thursday, according to Gatwick's CEO Stewart Wingate.

 The closure, which remained in place at 6pm on Thursday (1800 GMT), stranded tens of thousands of travellers days before Christmas - and prompted the unusual military operation. ""We will be deploying the armed forces to... deal with the situation with the drones at Gatwick Airport,"" defence secretary Gavin Williamson told Sky News TV. 

""We are there to assist and do everything we can,"" he said, declining to give the troops' exact role and adding that it followed a request from local police, who earlier in the day had ruled out any terrorist connection. 

Gatwick, around 50km south of the British capital, is the eighth-busiest airport in Europe and sits behind Mumbai as the world's busiest single runway air hub.

Inbound flights were diverted to other airports while passengers waiting to take off faced gruelling delays as airlines cut services.

 Some 10,000 passengers were affected on Wednesday night, and a further 110,000 who had been due to either take off or land at the airport on 760 flights Thursday. 

Gatwick CEO Wingate said the incident was ""a highly targeted activity which has been designed to close the airport and bring maximum disruption in the run up to Christmas"".

A cat-and-mouse manhunt is under way to catch those operating the drones, with more than 20 police units and dozens of officers from two local forces deployed. Police said they believed the devices ""are of an industrial specification"".

British Prime Minister Theresa May said she sympathised with passengers and vowed action.

N Korea says it won't denuclearize unless US removes threat - Times of India

","
SEOUL: North Korea said on Thursday it will never unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons unless the United States removes its nuclear threat first, a statement that raises further doubts on whether leader Kim Jong Un will ever relinquish an arsenal he may see as his greatest guarantee of survival.


The statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency came amid a deadlock in nuclear negotiations between the United States and North Korea over the sequencing of the denuclearization process and removal of international sanctions.

Kim and President Donald Trump met June 12 in Singapore where they issued a vague goal for the ""complete denuclearization"" of the Korean Peninsula without describing when and how it would occur.

But North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of denuclearization that bears no resemblance to the American definition, vowing to pursue nuclear development until the United States removes its troops and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan.

In Thursday's statement, the North reiterated its traditional stance on denuclearization and accused Washington of misleading what had been agreed on in Singapore.

""The United States must now recognize the accurate meaning of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and especially, must study geography the right way,"" the statement said.

""When we talk about the Korean Peninsula, it includes the territory of our republic and also the entire region of (South Korea) where the United States has placed its invasive force, including nuclear weapons. When we talk about the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it means the removal of all sources of nuclear threat, not only from the South and North but also from areas neighboring the Korean Peninsula,"" the statement said.

The U.S. removed its tactical nuclear weapons from South Korea in the 1990s.

The nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang stalled since the Trump-Kim meeting. The United States wants North Korea to provide a detailed account of nuclear and missile facilities that would be inspected and dismantled under a potential deal, while the North is insisting that sanctions be lifted first.

The North Korean statement came a day after Stephen Biegun, the Trump's administration's special envoy on North Korea, told reporters in South Korea that Washington was reviewing easing travel restrictions on North Korea to facilitate humanitarian shipments to help resolve the impasse in nuclear negotiations.

US allies in Asia-Pacific region rattled after Mattis quits - Times of India

","
SYDNEY: The abrupt resignation of US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis sparked concern among Asia-Pacific allies who credit the retired general with building trust and tempering isolationist impulses, regional officials and analysts said on Friday.


The region - which includes strong US allies Japan, South Korea and Australia - hosts some of the world's most volatile flashpoints, with high tension on the Korean peninsula and China's militarisation of the South China Sea causing friction.

Mattis, who embraced America's traditional alliances, said he was quitting after falling out with President Donald Trump over foreign policy, including surprise decisions this week to pull troops from Syria and start planning a drawdown in Afghanistan.

""He has generally been referred to as one of the adults in the Trump administration,"" Australian government Senator Jim Molan told The Australian newspaper.

He said his departure was concerning because it introduced ""another extreme variable"" into U.S. decision making.

Mattis has been a vocal critic of China's increasing presence in the South China Sea but he worked to ensure tensions did not boil over.

""He's been the point of continuity and the gatekeeper in the administration that they've relied on most to temper the instincts of Trump, which are much more, I think, isolationist and clearly highly sceptical ... about alliance commitments,"" said foreign policy and security analyst Euan Graham, executive director of La Trobe Asia at Australia's La Trobe University.

Mattis' departure also robs Australia, without a US ambassador since 2016, of a key ally in the Trump administration.

""Australia has always had the ear of Mattis,"" a US-based diplomatic source told Reuters.

Australia has had roughly 800 troops in the Middle East since 2014, mostly based in Iraq, as part of coalition efforts to combat the Islamic State group.

About 300 troops are based in Afghanistan, where they have had a presence since not long after the war began 17 years ago.

Trump announced on Wednesday that US troops in Syria would be withdrawn, a decision that upended U.S. policy in the region.

A U.S. official said on Thursday Trump was planning to withdraw at least 5,000 of the 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Mattis had advocated for a strong U.S. military presence to bolster diplomatic peace efforts there.

Adam Mount, defence analyst at the Federation of American Scientists, said Mattis was a steady hand on North Korea and was instrumental in preventing a war.

""Mattis was bailing water out of an alliance being buffeted by an erratic president, an advancing North Korea, and an increasingly assertive China,"" Mount said.

""His work kept the alliance afloat but major questions will have to be resolved to keep it strong,"" he said.

Jinnah House in Mumbai belongs to Pakistan: Foreign Office - Times of India

","
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan asserted on Thursday that Jinnah House in Mumbai belonged to it and any attempt by India to take the building under its control will not be accepted, days after External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said her ministry is in the process of getting the bungalow transferred in its name. 



The sea-facing bungalow on Malabar Hill in Mumbai was designed by architect Claude Batley in European style and Pakistan's founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah lived there in the late 1930s. Pakistan had demanded in recent years that the property should be handed over to it for housing its Mumbai consulate. 

""We have a claim over it (Jinnah House) and we do not accept that anyone tries to take custody of it. They (Indians) have already accepted that it belongs to Pakistan. We have record of it. They (Indians) have accepted that it belong to Pakistan,"" Foreign Office spokesperson Mohammad Faisal told reporters here. 

Asked if Pakistan would consider to hand over Kartarpur land to India in a swap deal, Faisal said: ""Absolutely not...It is gesture for Sikh minority community made on their request to provide a visa free corridor to facilitate visit to a religious shrine."" 

He said the decision to open the Kartarpur corridor was taken at the state-to-state level and the Indian government was fully involved in it. 

In a letter to Mumbai city BJP legislator Mangal Prabhat Lodha, Swaraj said Prime Minister's Office has instructed to renovate and refurbish Jinnah House to develop it on the pattern of facilities available in Hyderabad House in Delhi. 

""Accordingly, approval of the PMO was sought for transfer of the property from ICCR (Indian Council for Cultural Relations) to our ministry. PMO has now accorded necessary approvals,"" Swaraj said in her letter. 

The letter, dated December 5, further said, ""We are in the process of transferring the ownership in our name."" 

Jinnah's daughter Dina Wadia had in August 2007 approached the Bombay High Court claiming that being the sole legal heir of Jinnah, she should get the possession of the house. After her death, her son and Wadia Group chairman Nusli Neville Wadia is carrying on the litigation. 

Commenting on the release of Indian prisoner Hamid Nihal Ansari, Faisal said Ansari ""illegally entered Pakistan and was arrested for spying and convicted"". 

""On completion of his sentence he was repatriated as per law of the land (Pakistan),"" he said. 

He also said that release of Ansari would not have any impact on the Kashmir policy of Pakistan. 

Responding to a question about media reports regarding support sought by the Khalistan movement from Pakistan, Faisal said, ""Please note it and register it with you...Pakistan does not interfere in internal affairs of any country."" 

Faisal also condemned the violence in Kashmir and alleged that India was committing ceasefire violations at Line of Control to divert the world's attention. 

He said Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi wrote letters to the UN secretary general and OIC secretary general to highlight the recent violence in Kashmir. 

 On Afghan peace talks, he said that talks between the Taliban and the US were held in Abu Dhabi. 

 ""Our leadership has conveyed unequivocal support to both Afghan leadership and the international community of for an Afghan-led Afghan-owned peace process,"" he said. 

 ""Pakistan played a role as part of share responsibility in the meeting held in the UAE for peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan. Our role has been widely recognised and appreciated. I do not want to say any more about it at this stage,"" he said. 

Faisal also rejected impression that Pakistan controlled the Taliban. 

""We have always stated that Pakistan exercises limited influence over the Taliban...We cannot respond as to when the next round of negotiations between the US and Taliban will take place,"" he said.

'State support for terrorist proxies will not be tolerated': US's veiled warning to Pakistan - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: The US has told all its regional partners, including Pakistan, that state support for terrorist proxies will not be tolerated, the Pentagon has said, expressing concern over the free movement of some militant groups in Pakistan that are presenting security challenges for Afghanistan.


The Pentagon, in its semi-annual Afghan report to the US Congress that covers the period of June to November 2018, said on Thursday that Taliban and the Haqqani Network retain freedom of movement in Pakistan.

The Pentagon's remarks came amidst reports that President Donald Trump is planning to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan.

In the report, the Pentagon said that Afghanistan faces a continuing threat from an externally supported insurgency and the highest regional concentration of terrorist groups in the world.

""In this reporting period, the US continued to call on regional partners to reinforce our messages that state support for terrorist proxies will not be tolerated, that cross-border cooperation between Afghanistan and Pakistan is essential, and that the Taliban cannot achieve its objectives through continued military conflict,"" the Pentagon said.

""Although Pakistani military operations have disrupted some militant sanctuaries, certain groups — such as the Taliban and the Haqqani Network — retain freedom of movement in Pakistan. The United States continues to convey to all levels of Pakistani leadership the importance of taking action against all terrorist and militant groups,"" it said.

According to the report, the Haqqani network continues to be an integral part of the Taliban's effort to pressure the Afghan government in Kabul and eastern Afghanistan.

Sirajuddin Haqqani's role as a Taliban deputy probably increased Haqqani influence within the Taliban leadership, and resulted in an increase in Haqqani influence to areas outside its normal operating areas of Paktika, Paktiya, and Khost provinces in eastern Afghanistan, it said.

The Afghanistan-Pakistan border region remains a sanctuary for various groups, including the Taliban, al-Qaeda core (AQ), al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), the Haqqani Network (HQN), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), ISIS-K, East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU).

Terrorist sanctuaries on both sides of the border present security challenges for Afghanistan and Pakistan and pose a threat to regional security and stability, the report said.

The South Asia Strategy, which was announced by Trump in August 2017, has focused on pressuring Pakistan to limit support and safe-haven for proxy terrorist and militant groups and to play a constructive role in facilitating Afghan reconciliation, the Pentagon said.

""Regional efforts in the South Asia Strategy aim to expand burden sharing, neutralize potential spoilers to US and coalition efforts, limit threats to the United States and our allies and partners, and develop and support a durable political settlement in Afghanistan,"" the Pentagon said.

The South Asia strategy prioritises regional engagement to limit hedging against the Afghan government and create an international consensus for peace.

The Pentagon said the existence of more than 20 terrorist or insurgent groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan requires an Afghan-supported US platform in the region to monitor, contain, and respond to these threats.

US eyes complete withdrawal of troops from Syria: officials - Times of India

","
WASHINGTON: The United States is considering a total withdrawal of US forces from Syria as it nears the very end of its campaign to retake all of the territory once held by Islamic State, US officials told Reuters on Wednesday.


Such a decision, if confirmed, would upend assumptions about a longer-term US military presence in Syria, which US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and other senior US officials had advocated to help ensure Islamic State cannot reemerge.

Still, President Donald Trump has previously expressed a strong desire to bring troops home from Syria when possible. On Wednesday, Trump appeared to declare victory against the group and made clear he saw no further grounds for remaining in Syria.

""We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,"" he tweeted.

The timing of the troop withdrawal was not immediately clear and US officials who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity did not disclose details about the deliberations. But one official told Reuters that partners and allies had been consulted.

Two US officials said a decision to withdraw had already been reached but that could not be immediately confirmed. It was unclear how soon a decision detailing any withdrawal plans might be announced.

The Pentagon declined to comment, saying only that it continued to work with partners in the region.

The United States still has about 2,000 troops in Syria, many of them special operations forces working closely with an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF.

The partnership with the SDF over the past several years has led to the defeat of Islamic State in Syria but outraged NATO ally Turkey, which views Kurdish YPG forces in the alliance as an extension of a militant group fighting inside Turkey.

The deliberations on US troops come as Ankara threatens a new offensive in Syria. To date, US forces in Syria have been seen as a stabilizing factor in the country and have somewhat restrained Turkey's actions against the SDF.

A complete withdrawal of US troops from Syria would still leave a sizeable US military presence in the region, including about 5,200 troops across the border in Iraq.

Much of the US campaign in Syria has been waged by warplanes flying out of Qatar and other locations in the Middle East.

Still, Mattis and US State Department officials have long fretted about leaving Syria before a peace agreement can be reached to end that country's brutal civil war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced around half of Syria’s pre-war population of about 22 million.

In April, Mattis said: ""We do not want to simply pull out before the diplomats have won the peace. You win the fight — and then you win the peace.""

Islamic State is also widely expected to revert to guerilla tactics once it no longer holds territory.

A U.S. withdrawal could open Trump up to criticism if Islamic State reemerged.

Trump has previously lambasted his predecessor, Barack Obama, for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq that preceded an unraveling of the Iraqi armed forces. Iraqi forces collapsed in the face of Islamic State's advance into the country in 2014.


LAST ONE PERCENT

Islamic State declared its so-called ""caliphate"" in 2014 after seizing large swathes of Syria and Iraq. The hardline Islamist group established its de facto capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa, using it as a base to plot attacks in Europe.

According to U.S. estimates, the group oversaw about 100,000 square kilometers (39,000 square miles) of territory, with about 8 million people under Islamic State control. It had estimated revenues of nearly one billion dollars a year.

Brett McGurk, the U.S. special envoy for the global coalition to defeat Islamic State, said last week that the group was down to its last 1 percent of the territory it once held in its self-styled ""caliphate."" The group has no remaining territory in Iraq.

Hajin, the group's last major stronghold in Syria, is close to being seized by U.S.-backed SDF forces.

After losing Hajin, Islamic State will control a diminishing strip of territory along the eastern bank of the Euphrates River in the area where U.S.-backed operations are focused. The militants also control some desert terrain west of the river in territory otherwise controlled by the Damascus government and its allies.

But U.S. officials have warned that taking back the group's territory would not be the same as defeating it.

""Even as the end of the physical caliphate is clearly now coming into sight, the end of ISIS will be a much more long-term initiative,"" McGurk told a State Department briefing on Dec. 11.

U.S. Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, cautioned earlier in December that the United States had trained only about 20 percent of Syrian forces required to stabilize areas captured from Islamic State.

Myanmar forces conduct 'clearance operations' after two killed in Rakhine state - Times of India

","
YANGON: Myanmar forces are conducting new rounds of ""clearance operations"" in conflict-hit Rakhine state after four local Buddhists were attacked and two killed, the commander-in-chief's office said Thursday, with one of the incidents blamed on Rohingya Muslims.


The violence occurred around the evening of December 17 along Pyu Ma creek in northern Rakhine state's Maungdaw township, the same area where forces waged a bloody crackdown against the Rohingya last year.

More than 720,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh after Myanmar launched clearance operations in August 2017, and UN investigators want the country's top brass prosecuted for genocide for alleged abuses carried out during the expulsion.

Myanmar said it was defending itself against Rohingya militants who attacked police posts and has denied almost all claims of atrocities.

But the commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing's office said in the statement posted to his official website Thursday that security forces were active again and had been carrying out ""area clearance operations along Pyu Ma Creek.""

The post said the activity was sparked after two ethnic Rakhine Buddhist men did not return from fishing and were later found on the creek bank with their throats slit.

On the same day two members of another ethnic Buddhist minority were attacked while fishing along the creek by six men ""speaking Bengali language,"" but they escaped and were treated at a local hospital.

The post said authorities did not know the identities of the attackers.

Myanmar does not recognise the Rohingya as one of its national races and refers to them as Bengali to falsely imply they are newly arrived immigrants from Bangladesh.

Tensions are high in northern Rakhine as the government seeks to kickstart a repatriation process but Rohingya in Bangladesh have refused to take part without being guaranteed rights, citizenship and safety.

The Rohingya still in Rakhine are increasingly isolated, and several boats full of men, women and children trying to flee the state have been stopped in recent weeks and turned around.

The minority has long been persecuted and subjected to apartheid-like conditions in Rakhine, with lack of access to healthcare and freedom of movement curtailed.

Many fear that in their absence Myanmar is changing the landscape of their former homes for good, erasing all signs of their local history.

PTI files application for disqualification of ex-President Zardari - Times of India

","
ISLAMABAD: The ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Thursday filed an application with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), seeking the disqualification of Asif Ali Zardari, the country’s former president and co-chairperson of the opposition Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), for concealing his assets.


The timing of the move coupled with the upcoming decision of the anti-corruption court in two graft references against former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. The court has reserved its judgement against Sharif till December 24.

The application against 63-year-old Zardari was filed by PTI Sindh MPA Khurram Sherzaman with the Provincial Election Commissioner, stating that the former president had failed to declare an apartment he allegedly owns in Belaire Condominiums located at 524 East 72nd Street in New York, in his nomination form for the 2018 general elections.

Zardari was elected as a member of the National Assembly from Shaheed Benazirabad constituency in the southern Sindh province.

As per the past precedent, Zardari can be disqualified from holding public office for not being “honest and righteous”, the precondition for being a member of parliament under Article 62 (1)(f) the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and Rules of the Election Commission of Pakistan. Ex-PM Nawaz Sharif was disqualified by a five-judge Supreme Court bench on July 28, 2017, in the Panama Papers case under the same provision.

At Jesus’s birthplace, an app to manage the crowds - Times of India

","
BETHLEHEM: Bethlehem is buzzing, with more tourists expected this Christmas than have visited the Biblical city in years, causing the kind of problem that modern technology was almost born to deal with.


Such are the crowds at the church built on the site where Jesus is believed to have been born that the authorities are planning to introduce an advance reservation system through an app.

The app, which will be introduced early next year, is aimed at ensuring a regular flow of tourists at the Church of the Nativity, where at busy times visitors wait hours to see the underground grotto where Christians believe Jesus was born in a manger.

Details of the app, which will be in English to start, are still being worked out.

One priest said it would only apply to tour groups visiting the site in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, but the Palestinian tourism ministry said it would be for everyone.

While there are concerns visits could become unnecessarily complicated, the three churches that share control of the site — the Catholics, Greek Orthodox and the Armenian Church — say such an app is needed. “There is a huge squeeze. With the app, everyone will know what time to enter and which groups are there, so it will become more organised,” Orthodox priest Issa Thaljieh said outside the church.

Palestinian deputy tourism minister Ali Abu Srour said the app would also provide information about the church. “We are going digital with this issue,” he said.

Barbora Salyova, a 29-year-old tourist visiting Israel and Jordan from Slovakia, said the app could be useful for pilgrims like herself. “This is a step we definitely planned to make,” she said.

Tourism in Bethlehem is enjoying its best season in years, with hotels reporting especially high occupancy rates for the Christmas period, said Elias Al-Arja, chairman of the Hotels Association Palestine.

In total around 2.8 million tourists have visited the Palestinian territories this year, up from 2.5 million last year, according to the tourism ministry.

London's Gatwick airport reopens after drone saboteur sows chaos - Times of India

","
LONDON: London's Gatwick Airport reopened on Friday after a saboteur wrought 36 hours of travel chaos for over a hundred thousand Christmas travellers by using a drone to play cat-and-mouse with police snipers and the army.


After the biggest disruption at Gatwick, Britain's second busiest airport, since a volcanic ash cloud in 2010, Gatwick said 700 planes were due to take off on Friday, although there would still be delays and cancellations.

Britain deployed unidentified military technology to guard the airport against what Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said were thought to be several drones.

""What's happening on the ground is a mix of measures taken to give confidence that aircraft can be safe... Some of those are military capabilities,"" Grayling told BBC television.

Grayling said there was not yet ""a straightforward commercial, off-the-shelf solution that automatically solves all problems.""

There was mystery over the motivation of the drone operator, or operators, and police said there was nothing to suggest the crippling of one of Europe's busiest airports was a terrorist attack.

Gatwick's drone nightmare is thought to be the most disruptive yet at a major airport and indicates a new vulnerability that will be scrutinised by security forces and airport operators across the world.

The army and police snipers were called in to hunt down the drones, thought to be industrial style craft, which flew near the airport every time it tried to reopen on Thursday.

CHAOS

Gatwick's chief operating officer Chris Woodroofe said the perpetrator had not yet been found.

Flights were halted at 2103 GMT on Wednesday after two drones were spotted near the airfield. The disruption affected at least 120,000 people.

It was not immediately clear what the financial impact would be on the main airlines who operate from Gatwick including easyJet and British Airways.

After a boom in drone sales, unmanned aerial vehicles have become a growing menace at airports across the world.

In Britain, the number of near misses between private drones and aircraft more than tripled between 2015 and 2017, with 92 incidents recorded last year.

Flying drones within 1 km (0.6 mile) of a British airport boundary is punishable by five years in prison.

The drone sightings caused misery for tens of thousands of travellers who were stranded at Gatwick, many sleeping on the floor as they searched for alternative routes to holidays and Christmas family gatherings.

""There's no evidence that it is terror-related in the conventional sense,"" Grayling said. ""But it's clearly a kind of disruptive activity that we've not seen before. This kind of incident is unprecedented anywhere in the world.""

He said it was uncertain how many drones were involved but it appeared to be more than one.

""It's thought to be a small number of drones in the plural,"" Grayling said. ""It certainly wasn't a lot, it was the same small number of drones seen many times.""

‘EVMs , VVPAT cannot be tampered with or hacked’ 

","
BENGALURU: Chief Electtoral Officer, Karnataka, Sanjiv Kumar on Friday asserted that Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and VVPAT devices cannot be tampered with, hacked or manipulated.

At a workshop for mediapersons, Kumar referred to the Supreme Court also turning down demands from some political parties against these devices. He said the machines manufactured by BEL are scrutinised closely. ""There’s a standard operating procedure and once these machines are sent to district election officers, they go through various security measures. These machines are equipped with multi-digital identification numbers and if somebody tries to tamper with them, messages are sent to the central office. All machines are tracked through GPS,"" he added.

Kumar said three mock polls are conducted before polling day. If the machines are malfunctioning, they’re discarded. Another mock poll is conducted to ensure they’re working properly. He said no district officer or candidate will be aware which machine is sent to which assembly segment. Candidates won’t be aware which serial number will be given to them in the machine. The machines are Braille-enabled to help the visually impaired.

He said VVPAT has been of immense help in nailing allegations that EVMs can be tampered with. ""Casting a vote requires 20 seconds and around 180 people can vote in an hour. The voter can verify to whom he has voted for seven seconds on the VVPAT screen. It helps in recounting of votes. The thermal paper used in VVPAT can be stored for five years,” he added.

","
BENGALURU: Ahead of World Idli Day on March 30, a study by app-based food aggregator Uber Eats revealed that Bengaluru consumes the most number of idlis followed by Mumbai, Chennai, Pune and Hyderabad.


Globally, San Francisco, London and New Jersey are the top idli-ordering cities, according to Uber Eats. 

“The humble, healthy and hearty idli is the most-ordered breakfast item on Uber Eats platform in India,” the aggregator said in a release on Thursday. “It was most consumed in the morning, especially between 7.30am and 11:30am.

An order analysis for the last six months revealed that most Indians requested for extra chutney, sambhar and the spicy ‘podi’ to go with a plate of steamy hot idlis. “Just like chai and samosa go hand in hand, Indians love to gobble down idlis with fresh lime soda. Masala lassi and jal jeera weren’t too far behind,” it said.

Among the most-ordered idli variations across cities were thatte idli in Bengaluru, rice idli in Chennai, veggies idli in Delhi and Chandigarh, masala fried idli in Hyderabad, idli pepper gry in Kochi, finger-fried idli in Kolkata and veg masala idli in Mumbai.

Over 2,000 encroachments removed at KR Market 

","
BENGALURU: The iconic KR Market on Friday got some respite after the BBMP took up a massive encroachment- removal drive.


While permanent structures put up by 2,021 stalls were pulled down, about 1,500 hawkers who were selling their wares in front of the market as well as on the pathways inside were also evicted. “The permanent structures were built using steel and encroached the pathways,” said an officer. The civic agency was recently taken to task by the Karnataka high court for its failure to get a fire-safety certificates for KR Market. 

On Wednesday, BBMP commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad assured the court that the civic agency will take action. On his direction, a team led by solid waste management wing joint commissioner Sarfaraz Khan took up the drive on Friday, creating space for fire engines and ambulances to get into the market during emergencies.

Officials from all three zones (east, west and south) participated in the drive. Around 48 tractors, 15 trucks, eight compactors and eight earth movers were deployed. Around 390 officials, including 30 marshals and police personnel, participated and 240 truckloads of encroached material were transported.

Many small vendors, however, felt the move would affect their livelihood. They alleged the civic agency’s drive is only against small vendors and not the big players. “A lot of shops have not been allotted to anyone, but they are engaged in illegal occupation and trade. Officials have turned a blind eye to such shops. Over 38 shops here are running businesses illegally,” said vendor said.

AS Balasundar, health officer, BBMP west zone, said the BBMP will take strict action against those conducting businesses illegally from the market premises. “Trade licence from the civic agency is mandatory. There are over 2,000 trades and shops inside KR Market and most of them have not renewed their licence,” he added.


Hope for footpath vendors
Joint commissioner Sarfaraz Khan said BBMP will bail out footpath vendors. “The biggest task is to provide way for fire engines. Once the marking is done by the fire department, the BBMP will take up the issue of footpath vendors. Priority will be given to those who have obtained identity cards from BBMP,” he said.

Karnataka raids: No MP, MLA or minister targeted, says I-T dept 

","
BENGALURU: The Income Tax department on Thursday said that no MP or MLA or minister have so far been covered in the ongoing searches done by its sleuths in Karnataka.



The statement comes in the wake of Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of misusing government machinery and the I-T Department by targeting opposition parties and their leaders. The CM was responding to simultaneous search operations by IT sleuths against individuals in southern Karnataka.

The I-T department, till Thursday evening, didn’t identify individuals whose properties were searched.

A communication from the office of the principal chief commissioner of Income Tax, Karnataka & Goa region, said that the income tax department was in the know of of certain statements made by the chief minister of Karnataka. “Certain searches are being carried out by the income tax department in Karnataka, Goa on contractors and connected persons. No MP, MLA or minister have so far been covered in the searches. These searches are being carried out on the basis of credible information received,” the release said.

Responding to another allegation by the CM that I-T sleuths were using CRPF personnel for the raids, the I-T department said, “While it is true that CRPF is being used for providing security, the said Central armed personnel were requisitioned from the State Police (ADGP Law and Order) following normal protocol and have not been flown in outside the state.”

Fire safety at markets: BBMP chief issues diktat, warns officials of action 

","
BENGALURU: A day after the Karnataka high court castigated the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) over revelations that the city’s iconic KR Market lacks the mandatory no-objection certificate (NOC) from the fire services department, the civic agency on Thursday initiated steps to ensure other markets in the city are well-equipped with fire-safety measures.

In a two-page circular issued to all zonal chief engineers, BBMP commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad warned of action against engineers concerned in the event of any untoward incident at markets and commercial establishments owned by the civic body. He further asked the chief engineers to ensure executive engineers under the projects division take responsibility of BBMP markets and commercial establishments in their respective jurisdictions.

“It’s the responsibility of executive engineers to see that markets and commercial complexes are properly maintained. Daily activities, including providing water, clean drainage system, power supply and annual repairs, need to be undertaken by the zonal executive engineers (projects). Further, these engineers need to be well-equipped to handle any natural, climatic, fire emergency works in their jurisdiction,” he maintained. “It’s the duty of the chief engineers and joint commissioners to ensure precautionary works are executed,” said Prasad.

The commissioner also made it clear that the executive engineers will have to take up maintenance work in markets and commercial complexes, despite these structures being taken up for revamp under the Smart City project.

Karnataka: Bride throws up, groom gets virginity test done 

","
BENGALURU: An unwell bride who threw up minutes after tying the knot was allegedly made to undergo virginity and pregnancy tests by her spouse without her knowledge. The woman has taken her husband to court for suspecting her fidelity and harassing her. 


 The HR professional has not admitted to his mistake during counselling sessions conducted by Aparna Purnesh, a counsellor at Parihar family counselling centre (Vanitha Sahayavani) attached to Bengaluru city police. 

According to Sahayavani sources, the couple from North Karnataka - Sharath, 29, and Raksha, 26, (names changed) - who are MBA graduates and employed with reputed firms, met on a matrimonial site. After a few days of interaction, they decided to marry in November 2018.

Fifteen days before marriage, Raksha lost her mother to cancer. As Raksha went into depression, Sharath thought she wasn't happy with the marriage. 


Woman signed consent forms without checking

Meanwhile, Raksha spoke to one of her friends from her hometown, who supported her during tough times. Here too, Sharath mistook her.

On the day of marriage, Raksha vomited due to gastritis and Sharath immediately took her to a hospital. While Raksha assumed she was taken to hospital due to gastritis, she was in for a shock when she realised in the ward room that doctors were testing her for pregnancy and virginity.

Soon after the tests, Raksha lashed out at Sharath before leaving for her sister’s house, where she started staying. Three months later, Sharath came to the Parihar family counselling centre and filed a complaint against his wife. To defuse the marital dispute, the centre summoned Raksha. But counsellors were shocked to learn of ordeals Raksha went through.

“Raksha told us she did not know she was being put through virginity and pregnancy tests and that she signed the consent forms without looking into the details. She got to know about the tests only when they were almost done. On Raksha’s request, the centre tried to counsel Sharath but he did not respond,” Aparna told TOI.

Raksha has filed complaints with police and court against Sharath for harassment and suspecting her fidelity. The husband has filed for divorce.

Rani Shetty, coordinator of the counselling centre, said, “Raksha’s father passed away long ago and she lost her mother a few days before marriage. Instead of consoling her, Sharath misunderstood her and subjected her to tests without consent, which is illegal. We are providing her necessary assistance from the centre.”

Sumalatha’s son: Should we weep to win? 

","
MANDYA: The war of words in Mandya intensified on Friday. Independent candidate Sumalatha’s son Abhishek hit back at chief minister HD Kumaraswamy for his remark that Sumalatha lacked empathy for Mandya voters. He said he and his mother would not weep holding a towel in front of a microphone as Kumaraswamy did. “Why should we weep like him when we have your support?” he asked.


Meanwhile, Sumalatha accused Kumaraswamy of pressurising Mandya returning officer N Manjushree to accept his son Nikhil’s nomination papers. “I was informed by a reliable source that Manjushree met Kumaraswamy in Bengaluru and was asked to do everything to ensure Nikhil remained in the fray,” Sumalatha said.

Manjushree issued a notice to Sumalatha seeking her explanation as to why the legal proceedings should not be initiated for making derogatory statements against the district administration. She said Sumalatha had been creating negative thoughts in the minds of the general public. She gave Sumalatha one day to reply to the notice.

Chopper snag makes BSY miss son’s filing 

","
SHIVAMOGGA: BY Raghavendra, son of state BJP president and former chief minister BS Yeddyurappa, filed his nomination papers from Shivamogga on Thursday, an event which Yeddyurappa and former chief minister SM Krishna missed after the helicopter that was to transport them from Bengaluru developed a technical snag.



Raghavendra was accompanied by his wife Tejaswini, BJP Shivamogga district unit president S Rudregowda, former deputy chief minister KS Eshwarappa, his brother BY Vijayendra and others.

After filing his nomination, Raghavendra claimed the BJP will win more seats across the country as everyone wants to see Narendra Modi back as the Prime Minister.

Earlier in the day, Raghavendra performed special pujas at the Huchcharaya Swamy temple in Shikaripura, his hometown. He also visited several other temples.

While Raghavendra was attending a special puja at the Ganapati temple in Ravindeanagara, his nomination papers, which were kept in front of the deity, fell down. The priest though picked up the papers and kept near the deity.

Raghavendra was among 15 candidates who filed nominations on Thursday, as the process for the second phase of polls in the state was set in motion.

A total 15 candidates filed 20 nominations. Raghavendra, a sitting MP, is pitted against another former CM S Bangarappa’s son Madhu Bangarappa, who is the JD(S) candidate from Shivamogga.

Regulations lack teeth to penalise aggregators, put cab owners at risk 

","
BENGALURU: The recent standoff between cab aggregator Ola and the transport department has exposed a lacuna in the On Demand Transportation Technology Aggregators (ODTTA) Rules, which puts cab owners and not companies in a vulnerable position. 

 In 2016, Karnataka was the first state to frame the rules to regulate app-based aggregators. The State Transport Authority (STA) on Monday withdrew its notice suspending Ola's licence after imposing Rs 15 lakh penalty on the company for operating bike taxis in Bengaluru. 

 Sources say suspension of licence would have little impact on cab aggregators since they own only a few vehicles. So even if the department starts seizing cabs, it's unlikely to affect the companies as the drivers who have attached their cabs to the platforms may become the scapegoats. 

 ""While preparing draft ODTTA rules, there was a move to include a condition that aggregators should own at least 100 taxis to get licence. It was made optional due to some pressure when the rules were finalised,"" said a transport department official. 

The rules state that at least 100 taxis either owned by the aggregator or belonging to individual taxi permit holders are needed to get a licence. This means cab companies don't require their own vehicles and can instead enter into an agreement with drivers to get a licence.

Transport department officials fear this may help aggregators go scot-free in future too. ""We could have confiscated or cancelled the permits of 100 vehicles if they would have owned them. Now, drivers will bear the brunt even if we take action,"" said an official. So far, the department has issued licences to six aggregators: Ola, Uber, Utoo, Opta cabs, Cab10 by Alcord Info Solution and Letz Cabs. However, Utoo is no longer functional.

Both Ola and Uber refused to comment. 

 Department might have to refund fine 
 Rule 3 of ODTTA states that 'in lieu of suspending/cancelling the licence, aggregator will have to pay a fine between Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000. However, Ola paid a whopping Rs 15 lakh as the transport department arrived at the figure considering each of the 252 bike taxis seized. Sources, however, said some of these bikes were attached to another firm, Rapido. 

 ""We realised a fine of Rs 10,000 was too meagre for a company like Ola. We wanted to levy a hefty penalty to give them a stern warning and also to pacify cab owners' associations who opposed bike taxis. Ola agreed to pay the fine to resolve the issue at the earliest,"" said an official. ""However, we will have to refund the money if they challenge this in court as ODTTA rules allow a maximum fine of Rs 10,000,"" the official added. In fact, the rules are pending before the Karnataka high court so, technically, the department can't take action against aggregators. 


Autos not under rules 
 Both O la and Uber are running auto services but they don't fall under the law's ambit. There have been complaints from passengers that app-based auto fares have increased. Also, app-based autos don't ply by government-calibrated fare meters. 

 ""The ODTTA rules cover only taxis at present. We can do little even if we come across any violations,"" the official said. 


Aggregators flout norms

According to ODTTA rules, every taxi should have a display board with permit and drivers details, panic buttons, GPS control room facility, digital fare meter capable of generating a printed receipts, and a yellow board with ‘taxi’ visible from both the front and rear. “Only the 100 vehicles they produced while obtaining the licence have these features,” said an official.

Show cancelled, threatened over exhibition title, says artist 

","
Bengaluru: A city-based artist has alleged that an exhibition of his artworks, titled Nude with Mangalsutra, has been cancelled by the Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath (CKP) and that he has been threatened by unidentified people. 

Sujith Kumar JS Mandya, who was supposed to display his artwork at Chitrakala Parishath on March 22, stated he was directed to withdraw his work as it was hurting the sentiments of certain groups of people.

“I was supposed to display my artwork at the Parishath and I had already booked my slot in advance. But after seeing the title they asked me to cancel my show. The Parishath, which claims to be working for artists, is taking a political stance while displaying artworks,” said Kumar at a press conference held on Wednesday.

Kumar said he was receiving threat calls from various groups and individuals. “People need to understand that it is pure art. Women should be respected and mangalsutra only adds to their beauty. It is saddening to see people judge my art on the basis of the title,” he added.

Officials from CKP said the initial letter written by Sujith was different from what was in the invitation. “The first permission letter clearly stated the title as ‘Nude,’ and then he changed it to ‘Nude with Mangalsutra,’ which is his fault and amounts to misrepresentation of facts,” added the official. 

In CKP, we teach nude studies, but there is a certain limitation, added the official. 

Moral policing not right

Renowned artist SG Vasudev said moral policing against art is not a right. “It is wrong to condemn an artist’s works even before he has displayed them. As an artist, it is also important he or she knows his/her boundaries,” he added.

Minimum balance in Bengaluru Metro smart card fixed at Rs 50 

","
BENGALURU: The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) on Wednesday fixed the minimum balance to be maintained in contactless smartcards, which commuters carry for Metro travel, at Rs 50. This means Metro station gates won’t open if the balance on your card is any less.


In a media circular, BMRCL chief public relations officer BL Yeshavanth Chavan said: “In order to save Metro commuters the inconvenience of having to top up their smartcards at destination stations, the minimum balance on a card henceforth has to be Rs 50 at the originating station. This has come into effect from the evening of March 27, 2019.”

While BMRCL claimed the hiking of minimum balance (from Rs 8 to Rs 50) was to ensure hasslefree travel, many passengers have expressed displeasure about the move. On Wednesday evening, a set of commuters staged a flash protest before Malleswaram Metro station, demanding BMRCL withdraw the rule.

An irate passenger wanted to know why should he maintain a balance of Rs 50 when many of his trips cost less than Rs 25. “If we allow this to happen, the corporation will further hike the deposit in the coming days. Though we staged a protest, no BMRCL official came to hear our grievances,” said a commuter.

A senior official with the Metro had another justification for the new rule. “We have had many cases of commuters with low balance on their cards getting into arguments with our staff when they were told to pay the remaining balance at exit gates. Commuters are requested to note the change. They may also use the BMRCL web top-up facility for hassle-free travel,” he added.

With Metro already having sold about 15 lakh smartcards, Rs 50 minimum balance means Rs 7.5 core in its kitty at any given point of time.

18-second play enters Asia Book of Records 

","
BENGALURU: Three unique plays, including the one as short as 18 seconds, performed by city-based theatre groups, entered the Asia Book of Records, a world record registrar organisation. The achievement was realised at Ravindra Kalakshetra on Wednesday, which also happened to be World Theatre Day. All three plays have been written, conceptualised and directed by theatreperson SLN Swamy.

The plays were organised by Rakesh Raj Kala Trust, Rangabaduku Trust, SB School of Performing Arts – Rangasthalam and Simhadri Creating Network.

The shortest play titled Damana, which the organisers claim is of world’s shortest when it comes to duration of the performance, involved 27 artists. “When we started the play, the aim was to finish the act in 20 seconds. But our artists were able to achieve it in 18 second itself. The play deals with the killing of Ravana, a character from Ramayana. But what it actually conveys is murdering of bad qualities in us. The play on Wednesday broke the previous record a play that was performed in 1998 by at a team directed by Swamy himself. The play titled Anu was completed within 23 seconds and 23 artists were part of the act,” said Helen Mysore, a member of the organising team. 

Another play that set the record is of longest one-man show on the entire life of Raavana. “The play, Dashanana, was performed by N Chandan Kumar who went on to act solo for three hours and eighteen minutes. Earlier record of longest play by a single artist is titled Janaka Jathe Janaki. It was performed by Helen Mysore in October 2018 wherein she enacted 111 roles as part of the play,” said AS Nagesh, one of the organisers.

The last play that set the record was Navaranga, which went on for nine minutes and depicted darkest emotions through the colours of Navarasa.

Trial courts can sentence murder convicts only to life or death: Karnataka high court 

","
BENGALURU: In a murder case, under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, sessions judges can only impose two punishments on the accused — either a life sentence or death penalty. Any punishment in between the two can be given only by constitutional courts like high courts or the Supreme Court.

The Karnataka high court made this observation while setting aside an extended sentence directing the authorities not to release accused Ranjit K alias Batta and Bhuvanesh TP alias Kutti for the rest of their lives. 

However, a division bench confirmed the life sentence imposed on the two by the trial court in May 2014. “The power vested with the president of India, governor of a state and appropriate governments under Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution and also under sections 432, 433,433A 434 and 435 of CrPC cannot be restricted or curtailed by sessions judges. They are only empowered to inflict punishment under section 302 of IPC; either life sentence or death penalty,” the bench observed.

Batta and Kutti were convicted by the trial court for the murder of the former’s lover, Divya. Batta was angry that Divya had distanced herself from him following a marriage proposal with Pradeep. Batta threatened Pradeep over phone and hatched a plan with Kutti to murder her with a chopper. This happened on May 28, 2012 when Divya was walking in BTM Layout. 

Notice over illegal scanning centres

In his petition, Dr Saravabouma S Bagali, former MLA from Indi and a retired district health and family welfare officer, claimed that since Vijayapura, Kalaburagi, Bidar and Belagavi are near Maharashtra, people of the neighbouring state were crossing the border and entering Karnataka to get sex-determination tests done by obstetricians.

“This is one of the reasons for the low sex ratio (929) in Maharashtra compared to 973 in Karnataka as per the 2011 census,” the petitioner claimed.

BJP demands Karnataka CM HD Kumaraswamy's resignation 

","
BENGALURU: The BJP on Friday demanded that Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy immediately step down as he ""disclosed to the people beforehand"" about the income tax raids in the state. The saffron party alleged that the conduct of the chief minister went against the oath of secrecy he had taken while assuming the office. 


 ""You have no authority to continue (as the chief minister). You must resign. How can you put obstacles on a secret operation by the income tax department, Central Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement Directorate? Your conduct is against the Constitution and the federal system of the country,"" BJP spokesperson Go Madhusudan told a press conference. 

 He was reacting to the ruling Congress-JDS alliance's allegations that the I-T raids were carried out on JD(S) leaders overseeing the elections of Kumaraswamy's son, Nikhil, in Mandya and nephew Prajwal Revanna in Hassan. 

 The crackdown came within a day after Kumaraswamy claimed Wednesday night that the I-T raids had been planned from 5 am on Thursday. 

 Madhusudan said, ""You (Kumaraswamy) have taken the oath of secrecy too. When you had information about the raids, how can you leak it? By holding press conference, you belled the cat so that rats can escape."" 

 He also sought to know when did ""corrupt contractors"" become JD(S) relatives when the I-T department made it clear in its statement to the media Thursday that a few bureaucrats, contractors and builders were among those raided. 

 ""Give us account of the money you have stashed with the contractors. That is the taxpayers' money,"" Madhusudan added. 

 ""The searches were carried out on a wide range of professions and businesses including bureaucrats, breweries, MNCs, mining barons, diagnostic centres, trusts, educational institutions, medical colleges, real estate, fisheries, and film industry and including ""politically exposed persons,"" the I-T department had said. 

 Income Tax sleuths Thursday carried out pre-dawn raids at 15 to 20 locations including Bengaluru, Mandya, Mysuru, Hassan, Ramanagar and Shivamogga. 

 Congress and JD(S) leaders led by Kumaraswamy, deputy chief minister G Parameshwara, former chief minister Siddaramaiah and other top functionaries had staged a demonstration near the I-T office against the raids. 

 Kumaraswamy even called the raids ""political vendetta by the Centre"" and accused the income tax officials of working like ""BJP's agent"". 

 Meanwhile, searches continued in some parts of the state, sources in the I-T department said.

Opponents have used my dual responsibilities to target me: Karandlaje 

","
CHIKKAMAGALURU: Shobha Karandlaje dons two hats — that of BJP state general secretary and MP from Udupi-Chikkamagaluru. While critics in her party and a section of netizens feel she has not done justice to her constituency, which is spread across the coast and the Malnad region, Karandlaje, vying for a second term, is unfazed. She believes she has done what an MP needs to do and that is to be the voice of her constituents where it matters — in Parliament. Excerpts:


There were murmurs regarding your candidature and also a campaign against you…

The campaign was not by our workers, but by netizens who are inimical to BJP. It is they who initiated the campaign. As MP, I have undertaken development work that a constituency needs — including getting a Passport Seva Kendra, Indian Institute of Gems and Jewellery to Udupi, upgradation of state highways to national highways, doubling of railway tracks, electrification and a host of other projects. I have done a lot of work, but I did not publicise it.


How did these murmurs originate?

There were many aspirants for the party ticket and at one time, I had indicated that I would not contest these Lok Sabha elections. But when the party demanded that I contest, I accepted. This could have triggered dissatisfaction among aspirants. The BJP is a democratic set up and all have the right to aspire to contest polls. But it also the party culture that once it picks a candidate, all set aside their disappointment and differences and work unitedly for the candidate.


Your opponents describe you as an absentee MP and say that you are an outsider…

It is a lie. I have a house in Adi Udupi. Moreover, as general secretary of the state unit of the BJP, I was tasked with organisational responsibilities and was required to travel across the state in this capacity. I could not limit myself only to the constituency. This has been used by my opponents to target me.


What is your assessment of Pramod Madhwaraj as your primary opponent?

For BJP, any political adversary in an election is an adversary, irrespective of the party that he or she is from. Madhwaraj contesting as a coalition candidate will not matter much. It was just 10 months ago that the electorate in Udupi pronounced judgement on Madhwaraj and the electoral atmosphere has not changed drastically in this period.


What is your opinion on Tejaswini Ananth Kumar not getting the party ticket?

It is a decision taken by the party high command and I am bound by it.

CM Kumaraswamy calls Karnataka tax raids 'revenge politics' 

","
BENGALURU: Accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of misusing the Income-Tax Department to threaten political leaders of the ruling JD-S and Congress in Karnataka, chief minister HD Kumaraswamy on Thursday said the I-T raids were nothing but ""revenge politics by the BJP-led NDA government"".


""The Income-Tax Department raids on some businessmen and our important political leaders in the state is revenge politics by the Modi government. I will not be cowed down,"" Kumaraswamy told reporters.

Terming these raids as Modi's real and open surgical strikes, the Chief Minister alleged that the offer of a constitutional post to the I-T Director-General B.R. Balakrishnan has helped the Prime Minister in his revenge game.

""Highly deplorable to use government machinery and corrupt officials to harass opponents during election time,"" tweeted Kumaraswamy.

Rowdy out on parole keeps pepper spray for self-defence 

","
BENGALURU: Pepper spray, mostly known to be used by women for self-defence, seems to have become a favourite weapon at the hands of rowdy-sheeters, who prefer to use it to ward off attacks from rivals.

Central Crime Branch (CCB) police recovered three pepper spray canisters from a rowdy-sheeter in west Bengaluru on Thursday. The sleuths had swooped down on the residences of 10 rowdies in connection with the recent murder of Lakshmana in Mahalakshmi Layout police station limits.

“We found three pepper spray bottles at the house of Dhobighat Rama in Jnanabharati area, west Bengaluru. Rama, a murder convict serving life sentence, had come out on parole, which was to end next week. Suspecting that his rivals might catch him unawares, Rama kept with him pepper spray bottles,” a senior CCB officer said.

Alok Kumar, additional commissioner of police (crime) said CCB police identified 10 active rowdy-sheeters in west Bengaluru and most of them had a connection with the Lakshmana murder case. “All the 10 rowdies belonged to gangs in favour of Lakshmana or his rivals. We conducted the raids to prevent further violence over the murder and in view of the upcoming Lok Sabha polls,” Alok Kumar said.

Canada’s express entry process helps applicant land jobs 

","
Bengaluru: The invitation rounds held by the Canadian government on March 6 — as part of its express entry process — saw 3,350 applicants worldwide, including many from Bengaluru, being invited to apply, said representatives of the Canadian high commission at a session here on Wednesday.

Candidates invited to apply for permanent residence in Canada under the express entry system benefit from fast processing time of six months or less, said officials, who urged more foreign skilled workers to use this mode.

“Express entry will make it easier for candidates to secure a job before they arrive by facilitating matches with employees through the government job bank. It’ll ensure that candidates most likely to succeed economically — not just those first in line — can migrate to Canada,” said an official.

While explaining that the express entry system uses a comprehensive ranking system to evaluate candidates, officials said there are four broad steps —creating a profile and registering with a job bank, entering the express entry pool of candidates, receiving invitation to apply and applying for a permanent residence online.

“In the last round of invitations, the lowest rank scored was 452, while earlier the lowest rank ranged between 430 and 440. The invitation rounds are conducted once in two or three weeks and the process is less time-consuming,” said the outreach officer (migration programme), Canadian high commission.

huge tree on bannerghatta road: 60-year-old tree weighing 30 tonnes transplanted 

","
BENGALURU: A huge tree on Bannerghatta Road which was standing in the way of the Metro project has found new life, thanks to the efforts of environmentalists, citizen groups and the authorities. The peepal tree, weighing over 30 tonnes and aged over 60, has been transplanted to Arekere lake bed. 

The tree, which was along the Gottigere-Nagawara Metro line alignment, has escaped the axe. Efforts are on to translocate a 30-tonne banyan tree — also 60 years old — as well. 

Residents and environmentalists resorted to crowdfunding to facilitate the translocation. Environmentalist Vijay Nishanth said the peepal tree was pruned and carefully removed. “On Saturday night, we decided to transplant the tree and required equipment, including JCBs, to carry out the exercise. We had the backing of local residents,” he added.

Vijay said on Monday, they were able to lift the tree and place it on trailers. “It was taken to Arekere lake bed around 5pm, where a huge pit had been dug to replant it. We rushed back to the spot at 3am and decided to translocate the banyan tree too. But we couldn’t as the JCB controller didn’t know how to operate it,” added Nishanth. 

On Tuesday morning, residents got help from Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited, Simplex Infrastructure (which provided cranes and earthmovers), BBMP’s forest cell, police staff and Divyasree Chambers. 

“We resumed the exercise on Tuesday evening. However, the tree got stuck at Vega City Mall Junction on JP Road as the stretch is narrow. It will be transplanted on Wednesday night depending on traffic conditions,” he added.

Namma Metro’s Rs 50 minimum balance rule is anti-poor: Passengers 

","
BENGALURU: Opposing the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation’s (BMRCL) decision to fix Rs 50 as minimum balance in smartcards, several Metro users on Friday staged a protest near Town Hall.


Most of the protesters were youngsters who had connected through social media and had no backing of any political party or NGO. They waved posters and shouted slogans against the new rule.

The BMRCL on Wednesday increased minimum balance in smartcards to Rs 50 from the previous Rs 8.50.


Slamming the BMRCL for taking autocratic decisions without consulting passengers, they demanded the management roll back the decision. “The BMRCL management has taken a unilateral decision by fixing a minimum balance of Rs 50. This will make it even more difficult for lower income people to use the Metro. If a passenger wants to travel short distance, why should he or she pay Rs 50 in advance,” asked Krushika AC, who led the campaign.

“I was surprised when they implemented this new rule without even informing passengers in advance. It’s a big amount for daily wage workers, but they are aware that commuters do not have alternatives. In fact, the management was unwilling to listen to our problems,” he added.

Muthuraj, another user, said: “They claim to be ‘Namma Metro’ but they do not seem to practise it. They want only affluent people to use the service. We don’t need Rs 50 in smartcards to travel in Metros like Delhi or Chennai, then why in Bengaluru?”

“There is no rationale behind this decision. Why should someone keep Rs 50 when they already paid the same amount while purchasing a card? Will they further increase the minimum charge once they expands their network,” asked Guru Prasad DN also a commuter.

In two hours, the group collected over 300 signatures from Sampige Road Metro station on a memorandum they plan to give to BMRCL. “We will intensify the protest if they don’t withdraw the decision,” they said.


‘Unfair to punish majority for fault of a few’

Namma Metro’s average daily ridership is around 4 lakh. Of this, about 62% (2.3 lakh) are smartcard users. The corporation made Rs 50 mandatory in smartcards after several users with low balance allegedly got into arguments with staff at exit gates, claiming they had no money to pay the excess fare. BMRCL officials say there are 10-12 such commuters a day, which, however, translates to a minuscule proportion of the total users.

Sharanya GS, a regular passenger, said: “Those misusing the card should be made to surrender the card on exit if there is no balance or cash. Defaulters can later make the payment and reclaim the cards. Anyway, Metro authorities will have to refund Rs 50 when we surrender our cards.” Another passenger Sanjiv S said: “It’s unfair to punish majority of the passengers for the fault of a few fraudsters.”

Limited top-up option irks Bengaluru Metro users 

","
BENGALURU: The move by Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation (BMRCL) to fix minimum balance in smartcards at Rs 50 is likely to increase top- up queues at Metro counters. Many passengers are already complaining of limited recharge facilities and a blanket ban on digital wallets to make payments.


Currently, commuters have to either visit counters at Metro stations or use the web top-up facility to recharge their smartcards. Counters at some stations, however, do not accept debit or credit cards and insist on cash payment. There are also complaints against Metro staffers having issues with returning the balance amount and citing lack of change. 

While Bengaluru Metro authorities are yet to allow recharge through digital wallets, Metro rail corporations in Delhi, Hyderabad and Mumbai allow recharge of cards via digital wallets like Paytm and PhonePe. BMRCL is yet to tie up with unified payment interface (UPI)-based apps like PhonePe, Google Pay, Paytm and BHIM. Deepak V, a regular Metro passenger, said: “Recharging cards through counters and websites is time consuming. The website is down most of the time and staff at counters often do not have change.”


Defunct ticketing machines

In 2012, the BMRCL installed ticket-vending machines at major stations like MG Road, Indiranagar and Byappanahalli. However, the machines are now dysfunctional. Meant to help passengers get tokens or recharge smartcards, they were not recalibrated to accept new notes post demonetisation.

BMRCL sources said queues at Metro counters will grow. “Majority of our customers top-up their smartcards at our counters. Generally, people recharge for smaller denominations, particularly during month-ends. Such customers have to visit counters frequently for top-ups. We are also mulling increasing the minimum top-up amount to restrict such queues. As of now, we are studying the response to the new minimum balance rule,” they said.


Protest continues 

A day after namma Metro notified the new rule, many passengers have demanded a roll-back of the decision. Commuters say the new norm is causing severe inconvenience to smartcard users. 

On Thursday too, many passengers at stations like Sir M Visvesvaraya, Byappanahalli and Sampige Road protested against the six-fold increase in minimum balance (earlier it was Rs 8.50). Chaos prevailed at several stations after some officegoers learnt about the new rule only on reaching the automated fare collection gates, where they were barred from entering. “It is a hurriedly implemented rule without even consulting with passengers. They could have given an intimation at least a week before,” Arjun S, a regular passenger, posted on social media. “The minimum balance rule affects passengers who are commuting short distances,” he added. 

“We took this decision after several smartcard users with low balance travelled longer distances than what their card allowed. Asked to pay the remaining balance at exit gates, they’d get into arguments with our officials,” said a senior BMRCL official and added that they were seeing an average 10-12 such cases a day.

I-T officials refute charge, say no MP, MLA or minister was targeted 

","
BENGALURU: The income-tax department on Thursday said no MP, MLA or minister had been covered in ongoing searches in Karnataka.


This follows chief minister HD Kumaraswamy accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of misusing government machinery and the I-T department to target opposition parties and their leaders. Though the department, till late Thursday evening, didn’t identify individuals whose properties were searched, sources privy to the developments revealed some details.

According to sources, 20 premises of eight individuals, including minor irrigation minister CS Puttaraju’s relatives in Mandya and Mysuru were searched. “Among those whose properties were raided include a senior JD(S) leader in Bengaluru, a business venture of a relative of former PM HD Deve Gowda in Shivamogga, offices of PWD in Hassan and taluk office in Kanakapura. The office of a Congress leader in Kanakapura too was raided,” they said.

The office of the principal chief commissioner of incometax, Karnataka & Goa region, said, “Certain searches are being carried out in Karnataka and Goa on contractors and connected persons. No MP, MLA or minister has so far been covered. These searches are being carried out on the basis of credible information.”

Responding to another CM’s allegation that I-T sleuths were using CRPF personnel for the raids, the department said, “While it is true that CRPF is being used for providing security, the personnel were requisitioned from state police following normal protocol and have not been flown in from outside the state.”

No political affiliation

The department added that it’s committed to carrying out its functions in a professional and fearless manner. “The department will act on credible information regardless of political affiliation. We request that activities of the department should not be politicised, personalised or trivialised. Statements which sound like incitement to physical violence issued by persons holding very responsible posts are deeply deplorable,” it added.

The department said the its investigation wing carried out searches on a wide range of professions and businesses. The searches resulted in the collection of credible evidence of tax evasion.


JOINING FORCES: Chief minister HD Kumaraswamy and water resources minister DK Shivakumar, with deputy chief minister G Parameshwara, KPCC president Dinesh Gundurao and CLP leader Siddaramaiah, led a protest over Thursday’s I-T raids, outside the income tax office in Bengaluru on Thursday

Realtor held for tax evasion in Bengaluru

BENGALURU: A 47-year-old real-estate businessman-cum-politician was arrested in High Grounds on Wednesday in a tax evasion case. He was handed over to income-tax (I-T) officials.

The accused has been identified as Prabhakar Reddy, a resident of Koramangala. Police said there was a case related to tax evasion over Rs 2 crore with the I-T department. There was an arrest warrant pending against Reddy and taxmen sought city police help to nab him.

“We arrested him and produced him before the tax recovery officer of I-T department for further procedure,” said a police officer.

Reddy was facing more than 50 cases related to land grabbing and cheating across the city. Earlier, he was arrested by CCB police on February 22 and later released on bail.

CM sees revenge politics, tears into Modi govt after 8 associates raided 

","
BENGALURU: Income-tax raids on eight associates of top coalition leaders in Old Mysore region of Karnataka early Thursday prompted Congress-JD(S) leaders to launch a full-scale assault on the Modi government for indulging in ‘revenge politics’.


After predicting on Wednesday that 300 CRPF personnel would arrive in Bengaluru to assist in the raids, Kumaraswamy on Thursday said he, too, can unleash the Anti-Corruption Bureau on tax sleuths.

The CM addressed Congress-JD(S) workers outside the I-T department offices here following the raids. Kumaraswamy singled out BR Balakrishnan, principal chief commissioner of I-T (Karnataka and Goa region), in his fusillade against the department. “We are not against raids. But we protest selective raids conducted in Mysuru, Mandya, Hassan, Shivamogga and Kanakapura. Don’t work as agents of the NDA government which is in its last hours,’’ the CM said.

He accused the PM of misusing the department to threaten coalition leaders. The department said “no MP, MLA or minister” was searched.


Cab driver alerted JD(S) on tax raids?
Did an alert cab driver, who found bookings of a large number of SUVs to Hassan, Mandya and Mysuru very unusual, tip off JD(S) leaders on likely tax raids? A video doing the rounds seems to confirm this theory. A woman JD(S) worker, in the video, gives an account of how the driver sniffed the raids early on.


This is revenge politics: CM

“This is revenge politics; we won’t be cowed down by this,” the CM said. The IT department clarified that “no MP, MLA or minister” had been searched, but refrained from identifying the eight individuals whose 20 premises were searched during the day. The list included Mandya and Mysuru properties of minister CS Puttaraju’s relatives.

“Raid the Hassan PWD engineer’s house, not his office. I-T officials think they are descendants of Harishchandra and above reproach. Everyone knows how a ‘settlement’ takes place after a raid,’’ he alleged. “I’m told Balakrishnan is doing this on the promise of being made a governor after retirement,’’ the CM said.

Bridge gender gap in science: Rohini Godbole 

","
BENGALURU: A two-pronged course of action must be adopted to bridge the gender gap in science — in addition to societal and policy level changes to achieve gender parity, said Rohini M Godbole, a Padma Shri awardee, a JC Bose Fellow and professor at the Centre for High Energy Physics in the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, while speaking at an event on Wednesday.

Speaking at the third Lakshmi Nizamuddin Memorial Lecture on the topic Women in Science: Indian Scene and Way Forward at the National Institute of Advanced Studies, Rohini pointed out there is little gender disparity in colleges and universities in the country while the gap widens in PhD and career stages.

“In India, the number of women in schools and colleges is high and so are their achievements. However, the participation of women in research in science is low — thus indicating a serious leakage in the pipeline from college to university to scientific careers. There is a 10% leakage from college to university and a 5% leakage from university to PhD and a steep 15% leakage from PhD to successful scientific careers.”

Speaking about solutions, Rohini said, “Having a good creche on campus, providing on-campus housing for young couples, proactive hiring policies for helping couples manage dual careers, encouraging and rewarding excellence shown by women and improving the work climate are a few simple, immediate measures that must be taken up by organisations. A long-term action that must be taken is conducting frequent gender audits. All institutions must provide information on the distribution of women among faculty and students,” she said.

Bengaluru sets the stage for an Ashley Lobo choreography 

","
Imagine a narratively sophisticated act on stage, where every element turns into a canvas, as dancers paint the air and the floor with their breath, and even interact with each other through movements. Abstract enough? Get ready for an intricate and stylistically varied performance as globally-acclaimed choreographer Ashley Lobo brings his piece, Agni, to Bengaluru for the very first time. Crafted on Ashley’s trademark ‘Prana Paint’ technique, which relies on breath and meditation, this abstract contemporary dance performance features 10 artistes from Navdhara India Dance Theatre. To be presented as part of the 2019 edition of Adhyaya, the show is a collaboration with Mayuri Upadhya’s Nritarutya Dance Company.

 “The piece piques the audience to embark on a journey of Agni, as they seek the end. It cleverly blends details of contemporary dance with the intricacies of Indian philosophy. Trained in ballet and contemporary forms, the 10-dancer troupe makes an ardent attempt to explore the voice of the body and how it responds to different movements. Here, the body becomes a brush, as it paints everything around it through breath. Physicality comprises an integral aspect of the performance, which is quite layered and abstract,” explains Ashley, an Indian-Australian choreographer, who is often counted among those who are instrumental in placing Indian contemporary dance on the global map.

 Super excited to present avant-garde Agni to the people of Bengaluru, Ashley, who is also well-known for his work in Bollywood films, says, “The audience in this city understand the nuances of contemporary dance. And this fairly explains the city’s vibrant and prolific arts circuit.” The show is slated to take place at ADA Ranga Mandira today.

 Giving an insight into the collaboration, Mayuri says, “The main focus is to create a congenial climate for contemporary dance in the city. At its seventh edition, Adhyaya is primarily about manifesting a multi-dimensional approach to the art form. It’s about investing in traditions, and cultivate a sense of respect for the old and the new. It’s a matter of pride for us to associate with Ashley and his dance-theatre group this year. Agni has been highly appreciated around the world for its modern perspective to the Vedic form. Dancers from Navdhara are also conducting special workshops for adults and kids in the city, as part of the festival. So, it’s sort of a cultural exchange also. Bengaluru is a flourishing hub of contemporary dance, where the audience are not only well-educated, but also curious about experiencing new forms of arts. Hope this initiative draws people’s attention more towards interesting live performances.”


More about the performance…

 Agni is the Vedic God of Fire. It is a symbol of light and darkness, destruction and purification, beginnings and endings, sacrifice and knowledge. The ‘Prana Paint’ technique delves into movement through yoga, breath and touch. Premiered in 2018, at the famed Suzanne Dellal Centre in Israel, the piece forms part of its maiden three-city tour in India, the other two stopovers being in Mumbai and Delhi.

Rebels out of Tumakuru fray, HD Deve Gowda breathes easy 

","
BENGALURU: Janata Dal (S) patriarch and the former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda heaved a sigh of relief Friday with outgoing Tumakuru MP SP Muddahanumegowda and Congress rebel KN Rajanna opting out of the fray on Friday. 


The relief in the Congress-JD(S) coalition was palpable because Gowda had settled for Tumakuru - a relatively safe seat - after weeks of speculation, and the trouble from within the coalition was becoming a major cause of concern.

Now reduced to a direct contest, Gowda will take on the BJP's GS Basavaraj, who had won Tumakuru seat thrice on Congress ticket and once on BJP's ticket.

""Respecting the high command, I'm pulling out of the race,"" Muddahanumegowda said in Tumakuru minutes before his election agent went to the deputy commissioner's office to withdraw his nomination. The announcement came after the MP held talks with KPCC president Dinesh Gundurao and deputy chief minister G Parameshwara in Bengaluru.

Muddahanumegowda was the only Congress MP who wasn't re-nominated for the elections. Upset at the party's decision to hand the seat to the JD(S), he had entered the fray as a Congress candidate. Rajanna, a baiter of the Gowdas, had filed the papers as an independent.


Rahul Gandhi persuaded rebels to opt out

Presence of Muddahanumegowda in the fray had given Gowda the jitters because of his rapport with voters.

On Friday morning, Dinesh Gundurao and Parameshwara met Muddahanumegowda at his Bengaluru residence following a cue from Congress president Rahul Gandhi and persuaded him to opt out of the race in the interest of the party. Rahul has reportedly promised Muddahanumegowda a suitable reward in return. Rajanna had said he would withdraw from the fray if Muddahanumegowda did so, and he kept the word.

Women reservation: Three  women candidates in Karnataka Lok Sabha polls this time 

","
BENGALURU: The proposed 33% reservation for women was first mooted in Parliament in 1996. However, two decades and five elections later, and the bill — which proposed to reserve for women 33% of all seats in the Lok Sabha and in all state legislative assemblies — has apparently faded from the consciousness of political parties in Karnataka and, with it, all intent to provide equitable representation for women in government.


Now that the three main parties in the state — the BJP, JD(S) and Congress — have released their lists of candidates it has become clear that the political field will continue to be male dominated again in 2019.

The parties have indeed given ‘equal representation’ to women, albeit only in that each has named a single woman candidate for the general election.

While the BJP has fielded incumbent Udupi-Chikkamagaluru MP Shobha Karandlaje from the same constituency, the Congress has named greenhorn Veena Kashappanavar from Bagalkot and the JD(S) Sunitha Chavan from Vijayapura constituency.

The fourth prominent woman, Sumalatha Ambareesh, is supported by the BJP but will contest as an independent from Mandya.

The best performance from Karnataka so far was in the last general election, when 11 of the 21 women contesting polls were from national parties and the JD(S).

The saffron outfit has also found itself in a precarious position by denying a ticket to late Union minister HN Ananth Kumar’s wife Tejaswini. Over the past 19 years, the BJP has not covered itself in glory as far as providing gender parity in disbursal of tickets goes, with an average of only two tickets to women per Lok Sabha election.

While parties claim that winnability is the supreme criterion during an election, women contenders believe that there is no dearth of winners among them.

Speaking to TOI prior to being denied a ticket, Tejaswini clearly had no idea what was in store for her. A party loyalist, Tejaswini had exuded confidence that the BJP under Prime Minister Narendra Modi would give prominence to women in selection of candidates for this election and also push for 33% reservation for women in Parliament.

“If I am elected, I too will try to influence policymakers to pass the bill,” she said. “Winnability is just an excuse that has been hurting women contenders. I would say change is needed in our society and political class. I am certain that this change will come about, slowly but surely.”

Karnataka high court junks man’s 3 defences, upholds life term for killing wife 

","
BENGALURU: Refusing to accept the defences resorted to by a man convicted of killing his wife nine years ago, the high court has confirmed the life term imposed on him.

Choodalingegowda from Nayandahalli will have to spend the rest of his life in prison as the court concurred with the verdict of the principal city civil and sessions judge, Bengaluru, holding him guilty for killing his wife Madhushree.

A division bench comprising Justice KN Phaneendra and Justice HB Prabhakara Sastry, however, acquitted him of the charge under the Dowry Prohibition Act.

On June 30, 2017, the trial court had found him guilty on both counts; under section 302, it imposed rigorous imprisonment for life and a fine of Rs 10,000 and a five-year jail term and a penalty of Rs 50,000 under section 3 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.


Night duty, love affair & suicide

Choodalingegowda had claimed that he was on night duty when the woman was found dead. However, the court found that he had no fixed avocation and did not even continue running the provision store set up by him.

“The statement of his grandmother that Choodalingegowda had brought his minor son, Vikas, to her house at 2am or 3am on the day and left him there shows that he was neither on night shift nor away from house,” the bench noted. 

His second defence was that his wife had a love affair with one of her classmates and was in touch with him over phone without his knowledge. However, there was no material placed to substantiate the claim.

The final defence was that it was a suicide. The court noted that there is no material to prove it, but there is enough material to say that it was a case of homicidal death which ultimately proved to be a murder as the accused was the only “last seen person”.

Madhushree was found dead on the intervening night of October 31, 2010 and November 1, 2010. In his complaint, her father Malave Gowda stated that she was subjected to cruelty by her in-laws for more dowry, though cash and gold were given to Choodalingegowda at the time of marriage (March 31, 2004). Gowda purchased a site at Vinayakanagar and registered it under the name of Choodalingegowda, who is also his nephew. He also built a house for the couple and their son. 

On November 1 at 7.30am, his granddaughter who went to their house to bring Vikas found Madhushree lying with bleeding injuries. Choodalingegowda and grandson were not there. Choodalingegowda had brought Vikas to his grandmother’s house after midnight and before leaving, he told her he had murdered his wife.

Later, police arrested Choodalingegowda. He had hidden the sickle he had used to commit the crime under a rock in a hillock in Channapatna.

Celebrating Bengaluru’s most popular breakfast choice 

","
That Bengaluru loves its share of idlis is a known fact, but according to a latest study by a food delivery app, it is the most ordered food item in the city for breakfast, followed by Mumbai and Chennai. Globally, San Francisco, London and New Jersey are the top idli ordering cities. On the occasion of World Idli Day, we take a look at why Bengalureans love idlis, the origins of this healthy, nutritious dish, what accompaniments one can have with it and a recipe that doesn’t require overnight preparations.


Why Bengaluru loves idli
Hospitality consultant Aslam Gafoor breaks it down for us and tells us why idli is the most popular dish in the city for breakfast…

Easy to pack: Idli is one of the easiest breakfast items to pack and carry. Given how much we travel, it is the easiest thing to grab and go.

Nutrition and health: It’s also popular because of the nutrition factor. When combined with other accompaniments, like chutney and sambar, it is a great source of protein and carbs.

Easy on the pocket: It’s one of the most reasonable and affordable items on any menu. It’s a meal that everyone can afford.

Deep rooted in tradition: Some of the most popular restaurants in Bengaluru have upheld the idli legacy. It’s so deep rooted in our tradition that even to this day, several places are known for the idlis they serve. Plus, with the variety that the city offers, one can try many types of idlis, like Podi Idli, Thatte Idli, Rava Idli and more, including some newer variations that city hotels are trying.

Universal appeal: If you go to any hotel, whether it is in South India or North India, idlis are always on the breakfast menu. This shows its appeal across the country.


Origins of Idli
The origins of idli are not exactly known, but it is believed that it dates back to around 800-1200 AD. Several writings in history are known to have mentions of idly in their script. For example, iddalage is mentioned in a 920 AD Kannada literary work by Shivakotiacharya. However, some historians believe that it was the Arabs who introduced idly to India. World Idli Day is celebrated every year on March 30 and is said to have begun in Chennai by a popular idli-only caterer. On the occasion of World Idli Day, try out the hatke varieties of the classic idli that we have listed on the right.


Chocolate idli
Not a conventional choice, but this version of idli, is yummy and tastes like a desi chocolate cake. You can make it with semolina, sugar, chocolate powder and yoghurt. It is sure to be a hit for those idli lovers who also have a sweet tooth.
Serve with: Choco chips and chocolate sauce


Oats idli 
Made with a mixture of semolina, oats and veggies, this is a great alternative to the regular idli. Roast the semolina and oats, then add veggies, like grated carrots or cooked peas, and a few chopped cashews. Mix with fresh or sour curd and your batter is ready to use. Alternatively, you can replace the rice in the normal batter with oats, ferment for an hour and the batter will be ready. Note that this kind of idli may not rise, but it will be tasty.
Serve with: Tomato coconut chutney


Chilli idli
Make the classic idli super indulgent with this recipe. Cut classic steamed rice idlis into small cubes and fry until they turn golden brown. Make a tangy sauce with tomato puree, chopped onions, garlic, capsicum and chillies. Add chilli powder and salt. Once the sauce boils, mix it with the fried idli pieces and garnish with finely chopped curry leaves.
Serve with: Tomato ketchup


Chilli cheese idli
Chop cheese into small cubes and add it into a pre-prepared idli batter. Add in a few finely chopped chilies, in accordance with how spicy you like your food. Use the batter as usual, and once steamed and ready, dig into the delicious melted cheese that awaits you in each idli.
Serve with: Tomato onion 
sambar

An idli that doesn’t need to be fermented
Traditional idli batter requires rice and lentils to be soaked for around five hours before being ground. But if you don’t have time on your hands, try out this instant idli version .


Ingredients
1 cup poha
4 tablespoons urad dal
1 cup rice flour
1/2 cup sour curd
2 cups water
1/2 teaspoon of salt
1 teaspoon of fruit salt


Method
Roast urad dal and poha. Then grind to a fine flour. Add rice flour, salt, sour curd and water. Mix thoroughly to get a batter without lumps. Add fruit salt just before steaming.
Serve with: Pudina chutney


Did You know?
 The Defence Food Research Laboratory (DFRL) has developed ‘space idlis’, along with a chutney powder and sambar powder for astronauts, as part of India’s first manned space mission. It is believed that Rava Idli (in pic below) was created in Bengaluru during World War II. When rice was in short supply, a popular restaurant from Bengaluru tried to experiment with semolina, and thus, Rava Idli was invented.

Congress-JD(S) protest brings traffic to standstill in Bengaluru CBD 

","
BENGALURU: The pre-dawn I-T raids triggered a protest by Congress and JD(S) activists outside the income tax department’s office at Queens Road, causing huge traffic snarls in the surrounding areas for over three hours.


With vehicles piling up on Raj Bhavan Road, Ambedkar Veedhi, Palace Road, Queens Road and adjacent roads from 3.30pm to 5.30pm, traffic police deployed additional personnel to handle the situation.

Police blocked Coffee Board signal at Infantry Road, preventing the movement of vehicles towards Shivajinagar, Minsk Square and Balekundri Circle. The measure affected vehicular movement towards MG Road and Ulsoor. The traffic was diverted towards Shivajinagar through Balekundri Circle.

A private firm employee, who was stranded on his bike near Indira Gandhi musical fountain, said that it took him more than 30 minutes to travel a kilometer from Basaveshwara Circle.

“We deployed more than 500 traffic policemen on roads and junctions near the IT office to ensure smooth movement of traffic. The traffic movement became normal only by 6pm,” a senior traffic police officer said.


Nine agitators detained

More than 1,000 policemen were deployed at the I-T office. Police started detaining agitators around 5pm when they tried entering the I-T office premises. A few of them attempted to blacken the office signboards. “We did not allow anyone to blacken the signboard and immediately took them into custody and put them in a bus,” a police officer said.

Seemanth Kumar Singh, additional commissioner of police (East), said the protest was peaceful. “We detained nine agitators as a preventive measure and released them later in the evening,” the officer said.

Chief minister HD Kumaraswamy trolled over reaction to ASAT 

","
BENGALURU: After coming under fire on social media for fielding son Nikhil Kumaraswamy from the Mandya parliamentary seat, chief minister HD Kumaraswamy was again heavily trolled on Twitter on Wednesday.

This time, it was over his reaction to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement of India’s Anti-Satellite (ASAT) missile capability. While Kumaraswamy credited scientists for the achievement on Twitter, he later told reporters the Union government cannot claim success..

“Did Narendra Modi launch this anti-satellite missile?” he retorted when asked for a comment. “It’s a routine thing that scientists do. Was it necessary for the PM to keep people waiting for half an hour for this announcement? People in bathrooms, offices and bus stops were all tense.”

He said it’s not a great achievement that the government can brag about as it’s a scientists who did all the work. “Irrespective of any political party, scientists are doing their job. Is it necessary to seek votes on somebody else’s achievement?” he added.

This triggered a barrage of comments and taunts on Twitter, with most referring to the government’s farm loan waiver scheme.

After the recent ‘Elliddiyappa Nikhil?’ memes and parodies, the CM’s reaction to ASAT was a trending topic. 

“Exactly… Give loan waiver credit to bank clerk…” tweeted one person while another asked if credit for the scheme should go to bank managers.

“I can smell it here you go apply burnol,” tweeted Shravan, hinting that Kumaraswamy was jealous of Modi.

“After few hours, (the) same guy along with his Congress friends might ask for proof of testing ASAT Missile. It will not be a surprise.”

Tejasvi Surya deletes tweet opposing 33% women reservation in LS 

","
BENGALURU: Within 24 hours of being controversially declared the BJP candidate from Bengaluru South constituency, 28-year-old Tejasvi Surya was forced to delete his old tweet, one that went viral, about his dread at women getting 33% of the seats in the Lok Sabha. 




His 2014 tweet: ""With the exception of Womens' Reservation in Parliament, Modi govt agenda is inspiring. Dread d day when women's reservation becomes reality,"" was widely shared.

Though the 'Chowkidar Tejasvi Surya' handle quickly deleted it, the captured image gained momentum.

The Twitter-active Surya had also posted other controversial posts in June 2018 when BJP lost the Jayanagar seat to Congress.

""Call me a bigot, communal fanatic or whatever. But singular reason for BJP's defeat in Jayanagar is the complete consolidation of Muslim vote. Look at the below numbers from Gurappanapalya, a Muslim locality. BJP must ""really"" become a Hindu party & not just be perceived as one,"" he tweeted.

When TOI asked him if this tweet ran contrary to the 'Sab ka Saath, Sab ka Vikas' philosophy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said: ""The ideological inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today is PM Modi's promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as of today is to ensure that Bengaluru South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we'll strengthen Modi's hands. Rest is immaterial.""

HC warns of KR Market shutdown as BBMP says it lacks fire NOC 

","
BENGALURU: In a shocker, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) on Wednesday admitted that buildings in the iconic KR Market didn’t have the mandatory no-objection certificate (NOC) from the fire services department. 


This, in other words, means the oldest and busiest market in the city poses a major fire risk to shopkeepers and visitors. Miffed by the civic agency’s callous approach, the Karnataka high court warned of the market’s shutdown if important safety measures suggested by the fire services department are not fully complied with in the next two weeks.

Recalling a recent fire incident in Hubballi, a division bench headed by acting chief justice L Narayana Swamy said if an untoward incident occurs resulting in loss of life and property in BBMP markets, Palike commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad and other officials would be prosecuted by the court. The bench also directed the BBMP to remove any structure which is not in keeping with the sanction plan.

However, since the market’s closure would affect the lives of daily-wagers, the court refrained from issuing any closure order and instead directed the commissioner to submit a status report by next week on the measures taken.


‘No officers, corporators will die’
Earlier, when it was mentioned that the BBMP hasn’t obtained NOC from the fire department and hasn’t implemented 18 other measures, the court was taken aback and immediately took the commissioner to task.

“Not obtained an NOC? Then how can you allow the buildings to function and market to operate? We will direct it to be closed. Tomorrow, if an incident like the one in Hubballi takes place, can you bring back people’s lives? It’s not officers or corporators who will die, but only the poor and common people. You (BBMP) are only taking chances,” the bench said while reprimanding the agency.

The bench said the fire department’s report suggests that roads abutting the market are occupied by hawkers and setback areas by metal sheet stretchers and other combustible materials like plastic and bamboo for selling fruits, flowers and household items, which is very dangerous. Electrical ducts are not sealed.

“In summer, plastic is like petrol,” Justice Swamy said while directing both the BBMP chief and senior fire department officials to visit the market immediately and take suitable steps for granting of NOC.

Prasad replied that they have engaged a project management consultant and taken up a Rs 50 crore project to put in place a firefighting mechanism, of which Rs 2.7 crore would be spent on procuring firefighting equipment and 1,800 sprinklers.

He however, added the procurement may take time as tenders have to be invited. The hearing has been adjourned to April 3. The court is hearing a PIL filed by the flower merchants’ association, which has claimed that 50-odd shops are being constructed along public passage spaces and fire exit areas.


The history
Krishnarajendra Market, popularly known as KR Market, is the busiest wholesale market in the city. It was built almost a century ago, in the early 1920s. However, with it becoming congested, a new three storeyed market complex was built in the early 1990s. In the new building, the underground space is earmarked for parking and the three floors are predominantly occupied by flower and vegetable sellers. It’s also considered one of the biggest flower markets in Asia.

They would also tease and trouble several students in the area,” said N Shashikumar, deputy commissioner of police (west).

Devaraju and Chandrashekhar told police they used to threaten robbery victims with daggers and knives. The accused told cops they had hid those weapons at the grove near Acharya college on Wednesday morning. The duo assaulted police sub-inspector (probationary) Vasanth Kumar and head constable Shivaji Rao with knife and stones when taken to the spot to seize the weapons. Police inspector Venkategowda warned the robbers and opened fire in the air. Sensing danger, he shot Devaraju on his right leg and Chandrashekar on his left.

The accused and the policemen were rushed to nearby Sapthagiri Hospital.

Bengaluru: Youth ends life by grabbing live wire 

","
BENGALURU: A youth committed suicide by climbing atop a train engine parked on the stabling line and latching on to the live overhead wire providing power to the locomotive at Cantonment railway station on Friday.


Railway police said the incident took place around 12.30pm and efforts are on to identify the deceased.

We found nothing at the spot to help us identify the youth,” Cantonment railway police said.

Police said there were no CCTV cameras facing the parked train engine. They are verifying CCTV footage at the entrance and platforms to identify the victim. “We are trying to trace the victim’s identity and his parents/relatives to help us ascertain what exactly led him to take the extreme step,” a police officer said.


No disruption in service

South Western Railway officials said the incident did not disrupt train schedules as it happened on a stabling line, where trains are taken for maintenance, and not the main line.

BMC to shift stalls abutting Wadala and Lower Parel bridges 

","
MUMBAI: Civic markets abutting bridges and foot over-bridges (FOBs) are next on the BMC's list. Civic officials said they are considering relocating the licensed stalls at two of their markets located under century-old bridges to ensure there is no risk to life or property. This move comes after the Himalaya FOB crash outside Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus on March 14 which had claimed six lives. 


The two bustling markets under on BMC's list are: Dadasaheb Khamkar Mandai Vyapari Market under Delisle bridge at Lower Parel, and the civic market abutting the FOB above Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Marg in Wadala.

""We have already informed the 172 licensed shop owners at Khamkar market that they will have to move out as work on reconstruction of Delisle bridge is currently on,"" said a civic official. A decrepit market building nearby has been laying vacant since years. 

""We also want to shift the stalls that are along the FOB outside Wadala station to athe civic market building nearby,"" said the official.

King's Circle resident Nikhil Desai pointed out that there is a need to shift licensed hawkers outside all railway stations in the city into market buildings. ""This will ensure that the roads are clear for vehicular movement and pavements for pedestrians. Currently, these stalls occupy a large part of the footpath and even roads, leaving hardly any space to walk and affecting traffic movement too,"" he said.

Sion flyover to be shut two months for repairs from April 20 

","
MUMBAI: From April 20, the busy Sion flyover on Dr Ambedkar Road will remain shut for traffic for two months as its load-bearings will be replaced. The repairs were due since last October. 


While motorists are worried that the two-month closure will lead to snarls on Eastern Express Highway as the flyover is a crucial link between the suburbs and the island city, the traffic department is yet to chalk out a diversion route during this period. The flyover links Sion Circle and Chunnabhatti.

Movement of heavy vehicles was stopped on the bridge since Thursday 8pm, when a 10x15cm piece of plaster came off a steel plate attached to a railing and fell on the road. 


Expert says shutdown disastrous for traffic

Patch-up work was done on Friday and the steel portion painted over. ""There is no need to panic as the fallen portion was not a part of the actual bridge,"" said an official of the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC).

The over 1.1km flyover with 750 metres of viaduct portion has 28 spans of girders and 29 pillars. ""The Sion flyover will be closed from April 20 for replacing 170 load-bearings (located between pillars and girders) and expansion joints between girders on top, besides other routine overhaul and repair works,"" said a statement issued by the MSRDC, which is executing the Rs 1.9-crore overhaul.

Such replacement is necessary every 10-15 years to avoid damage to the structure, MSRDC officials said. Sion flyover was commissioned for traffic in 2003.

The structural audit of the Sion flyover conducted by IIT-B last year had recommended these repairs. Accordingly, a contractor was appointed.

The MSRDC earlier had plans to extend the flyover by adding three lanes. But due to the narrow road width and acquisition issues, the south-bound arm is yet to be built. As a result, one lane of the north-bound flyover has been dedicated for south-bound traffic.

""The two-month shutdown will be disastrous for traffic. The repairs should have been done months ago,"" said transport expert Ashok Datar. ""Motorists will have to use either Matunga flyover or Santacruz-Chembur Link Road. They could also use the BKC-Eastern Express Highway connector, but odds are that it won't be ready before June."" Another alternative for those using Sion flyover would be the Eastern Freeway.

Activist A V Shenoy of Mumbai Vikas Samiti said: ""This repair work is MSRDC's knee-jerk reaction to the Himalaya foot over-bridge collapse at CSMT. What the city needs is a planned approach to repairs and replacements, and a proper mechanism in place for periodic inspections. In fact, they should start working on a 10- or 15-year plan right away. If, after a proper inspection, it is found that this repair work can be delayed till after the BKC-Eastern Express Highway connector is ready, it should be done.""

Motorists too are worried about the traffic snarls. ""I will have to use the slip road, which will be majorly congested during peak hours. LBS Marg could have been an alternative, but due to Metro work, even that is now reduced to a single-lane,"" said Rajesh Gupta, a Thane resident.

Three injured as experiment balloon explodes at IIT-Bombay 

","
MUMBAI: A spherical balloon exploded in the aerospace engineering department's foyer at IIT-Bombay while being filled with hydrogen for an experiment injured three on Friday. A part-time staffer and two interns sustained burn injuries and were rushed to the campus hospital and then the National Burns Centre at Airoli. 


At around 12.30 pm, Tushar Jadhav, 28, a former student of the aerospace engineering department, and two interns - Prashant Singh, 22, and Rajat Jaiswal, 22 - were trying to fill hydrogen in the balloon to make it float. ""While the interns are not students of the institute, Jadhav was a part-time staffer with the mechanical engineering department. He had started his own venture called Manastu Space (incubated at IIT-Bombay) and had hired the two interns to work on his project,"" said a spokesperson.

While Singh and Jadhav are in the ICU after skin grafting for burn injuries across their bodies, Jaiswal is in the ward as he sustained only 4% injuries. ""Singh and Jadhav have 16% burn injuries on the outside, but we don't know yet the extent of the inhalation injuries. They have facial burns too,"" said Dr S Keswani at the Airoli hospital. ""At the moment, all three are stable,"" he added.

 A professor said the researchers filled the spherical balloon with hydrogen and then with air to make it a little tighter. ""Hydrogen with air is a potent mixture. On top of it they used an electric blower to fill air. These blowers have a brushed DC motor inside which can spark. The spark ignited the hydrogen and it combusted. It was either an oversight or sheer carelessness on their part,"" said the professor. 

 A student of the department said he could have been injured too. ""There could have been more victims. A lantern hanging at the first-floor level was burnt after the explosion. The students were not wearing any safety gear. There should be strict guidelines or protocols to carry out such an experiment in the open and under the supervision of experts,"" said the student. 

A professor said the foyer was an open space with high ceiling and a better place to carry out the experiments than inside a laboratory, where there is no outlet, and too many combustible substances are stored.

Mumbai University to provide student transcripts online 

","
MUMBAI: Graduates seeking to study or work abroad will be relieved with a University of Mumbai decision to provide their transcripts or academic documents online. 

The decision was taken in the management council meeting of the university on Thursday. The attested academic documents will be provided to the students in minimum time and at a nominal cost. Earlier, obtaining the transcripts took a month to a month and a half. The new process will bring it down to three to four days, said a university official. 

Around 15,000 students apply online for documents' attestation for foreign education or job. Currently, students, after collecting their transcripts from their respective undergraduate programme colleges, give these to the university department of students' development for attestation. 

Students are then expected to courier the envelope to the World Education Services, an organisation that offers credential evaluations for international students planning to study or work in the US or Canada, or the Canada Immigration Service. Not only do the students spend around Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000, the process takes over a month, said university deputy registrar Leeladhar Bansod. In most cases, the WES sends the documents back to the students' development department for re-verification.

Senate member Pradeep Sawant said they had been demanding the move for a long time to reduce the burden on students and to avoid delays. Many students end up losing opportunities owing to the delay, said Sawant.

Bansod said that the university will develop a software and then make a link available on the website where students can avail themselves of the benefits of the facility. 

After acquiring the transcripts from their respective colleges, students can scan and upload it on the link.

Navy man dies of firing drill injuries 

","
MUMBAI: A 21-year-old navy seaman died of injuries sustained during a combat firing drill aboard INS Gomati in the sea some distance off the city on Thursday. Seaman First Class Mohan Raj was brought ashore by helicopter and taken to INHS Asvini, the navy hospital in Colaba, where he succumbed to his injuries. Raj hailed from Katpadi in Tamil Nadu, his parents and two siblings making up his family. 

The incident occurred when the Godavari-class guided-missile frigate was a few hundred kilometres from shore. The navy said Raj suffered a grave injury and was moved to the nearest hospital by the on-board helicopter, a Seaking. An official said the exact location of the vessel when the incident happened and the time was not communicated. The official said the frigate would return to the naval dock on Friday.

""Raj, who was posted at one of the weapons on-board, suffered injury during the training,"" the officer said. ""The Seaking helicopter that was on-board rushed him to the hospital but he succumbed late afternoon."" A defence spokesperson said a board of inquiry had been ordered to determine the cause of the incident. The missile frigate, which is 72% indigenous and built by Mazagon Dock Ltd in the city, had reported flooding on January 12, 2017. The sudden filling of water had forced the crew to use submersible pumps to drain it out. The frigate underwent an upgrade in 2011 and was fitted with new weapons and sensors.

Mumbai: Traffic Police bust trade certificate racket, automobile dealer booked 

","
MUMBAI: The Mumbai Traffic Police busted a TC (trade certificate) racket and booked the owner of an automobile dealership in Vikhroli. A TC number is a temporary authorisation of transit till a vehicle is registered with the RTO. 



The traffic police stumbled onto the racket when they intercepted a brand new two-wheeler that had run up unpaid challans amounting to Rs 1.24 lakh. Investigations revealed that the automobile dealership, from where the two-wheeler had been purchased, had given out the same TC number for 330 other motorcycles sold by them in the past three years. Further, the police has also learnt that many dealers from the eastern suburbs have been giving out the same TC number to motorcycles sold by them, thus cheating the government.

""In November 2018, the value of unpaid challans had gone up to a staggering Rs 101 crore. The traffic police began drives earlier this year to get motorists to clear pending challans. Traffic constables were sent to the homes of those motorists who had run up 50 or more unpaid challans,"" said a senior officer.

On February 16, a traffic police team in Ghatkopar intercepted a woman riding a scooter into a no-entry. She did not have a driving licence either. The scooter had a TC (MH03 TC 337) as it was brand new. ""We were taken aback on finding out that the TC number had unpaid challans upto Rs 1.24 lakh. The woman said she had purchased the scooter only 8 days ago from Archana Motors in Vikhroli,"" said ACP Vinayak Vast. Inquiries with Mahadev Kanekar, who owns Archana Motors, revealed that the same TC number had been given by them to 330 other motorcycles sold since the year 2016. The traffic police checked their database and confirmed that different vehicles having the same TC number had been intercepted for violations at various locations across the city which meant that several dealers had been giving it out.

A case of cheating was lodged at the Pantnagar police station against Kanekar and the other unknown dealers. The police is probing further.

In Mumbai, kitten falls from balcony on seventh floor, lives to mew the tale 

","
KALYAN: Cats do have nine lives, it seems. A month-old kitten slipped off the seventh floor of a building in Ulhasnagar and, quite miraculously, escaped with a few minor injuries.

It was around Sunday midnight that the kitten, among a litter of five pets at the Kamaria family’s home, strayed into the balcony. The family has seven feline cats in their home.

It was only a little after midnight when a neighbour, who was in the building compound, knocked at their door and showed the family the kitten which he had just found outside the building. 

Quickly sizing up what had happened, the family at first gave it basic first aid before taking it to Vakratund Pet Clinic in Ulhasnagar. “The kitten seemed to be okay, but for some slight difficulty walking, said Khushboo Kamaria who takes care of the pets.

Dr Meghana Vadke, who examined and treated the kitten, said it not suffered any major injury. “Ordinarily, it is impossible for such a tiny cat to survive a fall from such a height, but this one seems to be an exception,” said Dr Vadke who had initially said it would have to be kept under observation for 24 hours but has now said it is out of danger. 

Khushboo and her brother Ajay are now thrilled to have the tiny ball of fur limping back to life. As a safety measure, their father, Rishi, has had the balcony sealed by putting up nets.

'Metro's future lies in boosting local trains' 

","
MUMBAI: A vast railway network could help redefine Mumbai as a metropolis of the future, when metropolitan cities, because of the scale of their economies would dominate nations, an urban planning veteran has said. Also needed is a multi-runway airport to handle smooth passage of domestic and international passengers. 

World renowned consultant Pedro Ortiz, who is on a visit to Mumbai, said reducing commuting time from 2.5 hours one way to 1 hour would alone increase the city's GDP by 25%. ""In the developed countries, the time spent in cars is calculated at $18 per hour and in the developing countries, at $4 per hour. Reducing commuting time will only help increase GDP,"" he said. 

Addressing the workshop, Reimagining Mumbai as the Indian Ocean Capital, Ortiz said that to grow, Mumbai needs 10 sq km of area to be added to it every year. If people living in slums are to be dispersed within the metropolis, a strong transport network is needed so that people can reach their place of work within an hour. ""Mumbai metropolis should extend up to Surat, Nashik and Pune. Metropolitan Mumbai needs the railways. Metro rails are meant for a city, not a metropolis. There is already an existing railway network and this needs to be further improved,"" said Ortiz, adding that transit-oriented development should be planned around railway stations and not metro rail. ""The current extension beyond Navi Mumbai (via the Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link to Raigad) will add more land to Mumbai and it will ensure a spurt in the tech and knowledge industry. Mumbai needs at least five such bridges... Also, for economic development, Mumbai would need to grow east-west rather than north-south. Integrating the economy with transport is critical for Mumbai's success.""

He emphasized that the city's future lies in a well-developed airport with at least six runways. ""The current airport is wholly inadequate and the new one that is being developed will go under water in 20 years unless a barrier is built. Mumbai will be impacted by climate change,"" said Ortiz, who regularly holds workshops for Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority. His current session was organized by the think tank Observer Research Foundation along with Rachana Sansad Academy of Architecture.

Mumbai: 100 auto men quizzed for child rape suspect 

","
MUMBAI: After questioning nearly 100 autorickshaw drivers, the police on Thursday tracked down a man accused of sexually abusing a child in Andheri (east). The suspect, Mukesh Yadav, was asleep inside an autorickshaw near Pinky Cinema when he was caught. 

The police said the five-year-old victim from Andheri was playing on Tuesday night when Yadav lured her with the offer of ice-cream. 

The police said Yadav took the child into the bushes across a drain at Goni Nagar and sexually assaulted her. The police said the girl screamed and some men arrived and grabbed a fleeing Yadav, but he slipped away.

The residents had had a good look at him and told investigators that the suspect was hunchbacked with thinning hair and very few teeth. An informant said he slept in autorickshaws.

Yadav, a watchman at an Andheri (east) society, lived in Nalasopara.

Congress says Devendra Fadnavis must quit after Bombay HC rap in Govind Pansare murder case 

","
MUMBAI: State Congress president Ashok Chavan on Friday asked chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to step down immediately on moral grounds following stringent observations against him by the Bombay high court in connection with the Govind Pansare murder investigation.


Chavan said that during a hearing of the public interest litigation over the poor performance of law-enforcing agencies on Thursday, the high court had raised doubts about the honesty and integrity of Fadnavis. “It is for the first time in the history of the state that the high court has passed strictures against the CM. It’s a shame on the CM, he must resign immediately,” he said.

Chavan said as home minister Fadnavis had completely failed to discharge his duties and that he was pursuing the RSS ideology. “Ever since he took over as CM, Fadnavis is following RSS ideology and all out efforts are being made to supress the voice of the opposition. Since both Pansare and Narendra Dabholkar always fought against the RSS ideology, the Fadnavis-led BJP government is least interested in catching the real culprits,’’ Chavan said.

He said that in view of the possibility of links of senior RSS and VHP leaders to persons detained in Nalasapora andelsewhere for possession of a large quantity of explosives, there was poor progress in the investigation.

State education minister Vinod Tawde defended Fadnavis, saying there was no delay on his part. “As far as taking decisions is concerned, I think there is not a single decision that is pending,” he said He said that the law clearly says that a CM or a minister should not interfere in any investigation. “Once we get the order, we will present our stand before the high court,” he said.

LTT still overrun by criminals, dodgy auto, taxi drivers 

","
MUMBAI: Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT) appears to be the worst face that Mumbai can present to visitors to the city. The dingy and dimly lit areas near the terminus are infamous for unscrupulous elements and rogue autorickshaw and taxi drivers who fleece passengers by rigging meters or plying longer routes.


While police and railway authorities say the station premises have been revamped and serious crimes have dropped lately, the recent murder of a 22-year-old youth by two robbers near LTT once again raises safety concerns among citizens. 

“The horrific rape and murder of young techie Esther Anuhya in 2014 by a man who posed as a cabbie at LTT stares you in the face when you visit this station,” passenger rights activist Anil Galgali told TOI.

Several trains arrive at LTT in the early morning hours or late at night. These passengers have no option but to use public transport. They are seen as gullible targets by errant drivers who enter platform premises to solicit customers and then fleece them. Some years ago, a prepaid taxi stand was set up at LTT by the A L Quadros-led union to stop the illegal practice but it was dismantled in 2018.

“There is complete lawlessness at LTT to this day,” said Galgali, who has been complaining about rogue drivers to the authorities for years. “We have been complaining about a cartel of notorious drivers at LTT but there is no proper policing in the area. In fact, most drivers succeed in fleecing commuters and then return to LTT,” said Galgali. “It is difficult to break their back unless the RTO launches a round-the-clock drive to weed them out,” said a commuter activist.

Both railway and transport officials have tried to cleanse the area but have been unsuccessful. 

State transport commissioner Shekhar Channe had recently expressed willingness to start a prepaid auto service for commuter safety. But the railways need to allocate land for the purpose and an autorickshaw union must come forward to run the service.

In the past, commuters, especially women, have complained of “nightmarish” experiences. Quadros, too, admitted to chaos outside the station. “We have complained several times to the transport department and the railways but the situation has not changed till date,” he said.

G R Vora, a commuter activist, said, “In case of a criminal record, the driver should compulsorily obtain a police NOC to ply a vehicle.”

Shashank Rao of Mumbai Autorickshawmen’s Union said a list of rogue drivers and their locations can be provided to RTOs and traffic police for action.

Barred students may be allowed to take FYJC test

MUMBAI: Many of the debarred first-year junior college (FYJC) students from Mazgaon's Burhani College may be allowed to appear for their final exams starting April 10. The college came out with a list of more than 100 students two days ago debarring them from the upcoming exam for not fulfilling the attendance criteria. Their parents were shocked to get the notice two weeks before the exam and approached the local MLA to seek relief. 


Wasim Khan, a relative of a student, said many alleged that the biometric system installed in the college did not function on most days. ""Even if the students were falling short of attendance, the college could have informed the parents earlier. At the fag end of the academic session, there was little scope to fix the attendance problem,"" said Khan.

MLA Waris Pathan met the college administration on Friday with complaints from students. While the principal was unavailable for comment, Pathan said he has agreed to review the list. ""Students with very poor attendance will not be allowed to write the exam but the principal has agreed to consider those who were more regular and performed better in the previous exams,"" he said. The college may put up a fresh list in two days.

Mumbaikars dive in for some wet action 

","
It was more than a stroke of luck that met the city’s swimming enthusiasts. Hard work and training also paid off as they won accolades at the Open Water Swimming Competition, which was held off Gateway Of India, recently. The event was an initiative towards mission Olympics 2020, as open water swimming is now an Olympic sport. 


Sunshine and water




Readying to take the plunge
Kicking off at 9 am, there were participants in six categories, five for experienced sea swimmers and one, a 2-km swim for first-timers. They took off from Sunk Rock to Gateway. Says Mayank Vyas of a foundation that promotes swimming in the city, “Mumbai’s open water swimmers can do very well in the open sea swimming category. They just need encouragement and a good platform. I think more people must come forward for such events at locations across the country. Sea swimming as a physical activity and a potential medal-winning sport.”


‘Every time you get into the sea, it offers a new challenge’




Swimming in the sea isn't easy 
Income Tax employee and Vile Parle resident, Shweta Mhatre won in the 26-40 age category. Having taken part in the England-France sea relay, she says, “I am regular swimmer and my day is divided into work and practice. I had experienced sea swimming in a few events from Mora-Gateway (14 km) and Rewas-Gateway (24 km). But every time you get into the sea, it offers a new challenge. For instance, if the tide changes it takes longer to swim. We also come across fish and if 
it’s jellyfish, it stings hard. We put on grease so that bigger fish don’t come near us. It’s not easy, you are on edge in the water all the time,” she reveals. 

For SYBCom student of Elphinstone College and first-time sea swimmer, Abhijit Pevekar, adds, “I did the 2-km distance as it was a new experience. And I completed it in 27 minutes; 25 should be enough, but the underwater current was against me. Swimming in the open sea was my dream and it feels great to have achieved it. Being in the open sea is scary, too, but once you start swimming you lose all fear and just move with the flow. Also, we wore a tracing chip for safety so that was good. I feel more Mumbaikars should take up this sport. Once you have permissions and pool practice, you can learn in the sea.”

Bombay HC tells BMC to open Dadar ground for public

MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Thursday asked BMC to give the public access to a plot designated as a recreation ground near Shivaji Park, where the corporation had constructed an enclosure with metal rods and nets. BMC assured the court it would open the enclosure's gate within 24 hours, but opposed removing the net. The court said the net would have to go while the matter was being heard. 

""As a corporation, why are you stopping children from playing on the ground or restricting access to the general public? Give access to the ground from all sides,"" said a division bench of Chief Justice Naresh Patil and Justice Nitin Jamdar, hearing a petition by Mahim resident Pankaj Rajmachikar.

The plot, spread over almost 7,400 sqft, lies behind Park Club, abutting Dadar beach. The ground was leased to the club. Advocate Amit Jamsandekar, counsel for the petitioner, said locals noticed the construction of the enclosure on March 22. ""The plot was used by the public for fitness training, yoga, box cricket and as an open space,"" said the advocate. According to the PIL, the plot was a publicly accessible open space and is reserved as a recreation ground in the Development Plan. ""The construction of such a fixed metal structure on the plot is violative of Coastal Regulation Zone norms and the Environment Protection Act. It abuts the sea and is within 10 metres of the high tide line,"" the petition said.

Senior advocate Anil Sakhare said BMC would remove the gate of the enclosure within 24 hours so that the plot is accessible to the public. 

The bench asked the corporation not to carry on further work on the plot and remove the net. The matter is scheduled for further hearing on April 25.

Don't neglect that pain. It could be angina of limbs 

","
By:
Dr Hemant Thacker

Did you know there is more to arterial blockage than heart and brain? That peripheral vascular disease (PVD) means blockages in arteries of usually the lower limbs due to a clot-layering plaque? 


 In fact, this blockage is recognised by the phenomenon of claudication which is a gradually progressive symptom, wherein there is painful cramping on walking, relieved by rest.

 The inner lining of these arteries gets layered with cholesterol deposits especially in the obese, diabetic, hypertensive and smoking population, thus compromising blood flow. When the narrowing becomes critical, the patient starts getting pain when even the slightly exercising muscles do not get augmentation in blood supply.

 On cessation of walking, the demand-supply situation improves and pain vanishes. Pain, usually in the calf muscles, can be anywhere from hip to toes and can be debilitating. Associated symptoms of PVD are numbness, weakness, coldness, with the overlying skin becoming shiny, dry and even hairless. The toe nails become fragile and trivial injuries can become non healing ulcers. In the diabetic this can precipitate gangrene which can lead to amputation. Erectile dysfunction is also seen.

Besides the lifestyle disorders of which nicotine is a huge culprit, collagen disorders like arteritis, and certain inherited disorders also cause PVD. Raynaud's phenomenon is a peculiar condition seen more in females in which the arteries of the upper limb go into spasm usually when exposed to cold and then open up when the hand is warmed up. Repeated episodes cause ulcers on the finger pulp with loss of sensation 

 By the same token, Buerger's disease occurs in males, afflicts the arteries of the legs and has a direct correlation to nicotine. 

 Clinically, the doctor finds pulse absent in the affected limb and confirms with a Doppler or an angiogram.

 So, what's the remedy? Obviously lifestyle modification - Stop smoking, control sugars and pressure, lose weight, take anti-lipid measures, exercise and, when indicated, start taking blood thinners. There are a few, but not so potent, drugs to expand the narrowing arteries or increase the blood flow. They do help, but if the underlying pathology is allowed to continue relentlessly then finally occlusion is a must.

 One can do an angiogram to check for blockages in arteries of the heart and if the block is discrete and focal patients can get an angioplastic stent. However, the coronary arteries are small and drape over a fist-sized organ, while the arteries of the limbs are long and the block is spread in a tapering fashion, making plasty unsuccessful.

 Again if there is a localized segment of an artery which is diseased or damaged (accidental) and the rest of the artery is normal, one can consider grafting and bypass, but in PVD, as the term goes, it is peripheral and widespread making surgical procedures theoretical.

 Early diagnosis by recognising claudication with timely lifestyle change can control symptoms, delay progression and improve quality of life. Valiant patients must have a 'kesari' spirit to overcome the trials and tribulations of this chronic progressive disease if they want to take 'badla' against PVD.

Though Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant described the meeting as routine, senior party leaders said the Maharashtra Congress leadership was at the receiving end over the manner in which it allotted seats. Though there was no dispute in Mumbai, discontent is brewing across the state over wrong selection of nominees and confusion at all levels.

A former Congress MP said it was too late for the high command to depute observers. ""There was lack of coordination, decisions taken by the state-level screening committee and in New Delhi, were changed without the knowledge of state Congress president Ashok Chavan,'' he said.

Bombay Court tells government to stop sale of protected species in pet shops 

","
MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has told the government to ensure that pet shops do not sell protected species like mynas, parrots, turtles or puppies less than two weeks old.





The order to ensure there is no animal cruelty and to implement the Pet Shop Rules 2018 and the Dog Breeding and Marketing Rules 2017 came on a public interest litigation.

The bench of Chief Justice Naresh H Patil and Justice N M Jamdar passed the order on a PIL by Shivraj Patne who sought to ensure that all pet shops and dog breeders are registered with the notified body.

After the counsel for the State Animal Welfare Board (SAWB) brought to the court’s notice that Nashik, Latur and Nandurbar districts do not have a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), the bench directed that these be set up with NGO-appointed members in the three districts. “The HC directives will set up a proper infrastructure in the state to implement pet shop and dog breeding rules that were brought out in the notifications by the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change,” said SAWB counsel Ambika Hiranandani. “Now, all districts will have functioning SPCAs, governed by the State Animal Welfare Board, to ensure that animal cruelty does not take place in pet shops, during dog breeding and sale of animals.” 

Poonam Mahajan, SAWB chairperson, welcomed the order. “Animal welfare needs infrastructure, else our laws will remain on paper and animals will continue to suffer.” 

The court also took note of the state counsel’s argument that the government has moved a budget proposal for Rs 5 crore for the SAWB and an additional Rs 5 crore for SPCAs. The counsel added that the government endeavors to pass the proposals in the supplementary budget in June.

PETA activists allege that pet shops and breeders often sell ill and injured animals to unsuspecting public, fail to provide veterinary care to animals, keep animals in filthy cages and often fail to provide them adequate food or water. CEO of PETA India Manilal Valliyate told TOI: “PETA India welcomes the HC order... Laws to protect animals in pet shops and used by breeders are a step in the right direction but enforcement is often lacking.”

Lok sabha elections: Stars arrive at the party, but will they all shine? 

","
MUMBAI: For the first time in the recent political history of Maharashtra, two couples have been selected as their parties' star campaigners for a general election. For the Congress, it is its state chief Ashok Chavan and his wife Amita, and for the NCP, it is former aviation minister Praful Patel and his wife Varsha. Since the parties are alliance partners, the couples will campaign for both. 

In a Lok Sabha poll, the candidate is, of course, important for determining the fate of a party at a constituency, but star campaigners can swing voters and influence outcomes. There's also a financial angle. The travel expenses of star campaigners are not accounted for in the election expense accounts of a party's candidates, and are considered to be part of the party's kitty. A 'star campaigner' is, in fact, a legal entity, and the Election Commission allows a recognized national or state party to declare up to 40, and a registered but unrecognised party to nominate a maximum of 20. 

""The concept of star campaigner ultimately benefit the candidate,"" said former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan. ""Since I am among Congress's star campaigners, I will use the opportunity to expose the government failures, particularly its failure to tackle the agrarian crisis, the adverse impact of GST and demonetization, and above all, the failure to create jobs."" The Congress's star campaigners include party matriarch Sonia Gandhi, party chief Rahul Gandhi, leader Priyanka Vadra, former PM Manmohan Singh, and former skipper Mohammad Azharuddin. 

The NCP's include party founder Sharad Pawar, Baramati MP Supriya Sule, and actor Amol Kolhe

A senior BJP leader said the star campaigner concept is good as party stalwarts get an opportunity to speak directly to the electorate without candidates having to curtail the scope of their personal campaigns. ""Senior leaders will campaign across the state, without burdening our candidates.""

The BJP's star list includes Prime Minister Narendra Modi, party chief Amit Shah, and veterans L K Advani and M M Joshi. Saffron sister Shiv Sena's list includes chieftain Uddhav Thackeray and his son Aditya.

Western Railway's pole shift stops deaths of people leaning out of trains 

","
MUMBAI: Western Railway has shifted eight poles close to tracks to prevent accidents of commuters leaning out of train compartments. Ten commuters were killed and 45 injured after being hit by railway poles in 2018. A comprehensive study had been commissioned to identify poles in Mumbai suburban section. After work to move the poles began, no deaths have been reported since January 2019. 


As part of an effort to reduce rail deaths, a Western Railway electrical branch team surveyed the tracks along with Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel. 

""A study was conducted to identify vulnerable locations and accidents reported in previous years were taken into account. It was decided to move railway poles in stretches where deaths had been reported. Thirteen poles were identified, of which eight have been moved and work is on to move the remaining five,"" said a senior WR official. 

Most poles identified were in the Bandra-Vile Parle stretch, including Bandra Terminus. Three poles were found in the extended suburbs between Mira Road and Vasai and one pole in south Mumbai, between Grant Road and Mahalaxmi stations. 

RPF officers said commuters sometimes lean out of coaches even when there is space to stand inside. Few years back, a collegian hit his head on a railway pole between Malad-Kandivli stations as he was leaning out of the train while chatting with friends. He was pronounced dead in hospital. 

""Besides structural changes, we are creating awareness among commuters to discourage dangerous travel and stunts. This is being done through skits on station premises, announcements on PA systems and on social media,"" said S R Gandhi, senior divisional security commissioner, WR, RPF. 

""Efforts to create awareness are being followed up by prosecution. In 2018, over 7,300 commuters were prosecuted under Indian Railway Act for travelling on the footboard. This year, we have prosecuted 1,200 commuters till March 28,"" Gandhi added.

‘I aim to represent India in 2024 Olympics’ 

","
Thirteen-year-old Khushi Ankur Punj from Mumbai was recently declared the world’s youngest 3rd degree karate black belt holder.

At 13, Khushi Ankur Punj is just like other girls her age with a life that revolves around school, studies and friends. And just like them, she loves to play games on the phone and the field. However, what sets this kid apart from others, is her confidence, discipline, perseverance and single-minded dedication to karate. She has been learning martial arts from the time she was three-and-half-years old and was recently felicitated for becoming the world’s youngest third-degree black belt holder.



‘Everyone should take up sports’
For a karate champion, Khushi is surprisingly soft spoken and is well-trained in creative art forms too. “I am the lead player in my school band and a Kathak dancer as well,” she reveals. She also dabbles in other forms of martial arts like stick rotation, stick fight and also, fencing (a combat sport with a sword or sabre). The teenager believes that everyone should take up some form of sports, especially since children are always under so much academic pressure to perform in today’s time. “I really would like to encourage other children my age to take up sport activities. Physical activities and sports are helpful to relieve stress, rejuvenate and increase fitness levels,” she adds.



‘I use my defeats to inspire me’
Khushi takes inspiration from her mother Ruchi, who is a radio jockey. “My father stays abroad. And though he is supportive, it is my mother who has constantly motivated me to improve.” In her decade-long life as a karate champ, she has had to face a few defeats, too. “I use my weaknesses and defeats to inspire and motivate me to improve,” she shares.



‘I want to be a part of the first Indian Karate team in 2024 Olympics’
Khushi is keen to perform on international sport platforms and make her country proud. “I have an inbuilt desire and aim to serve my country. And I feel that winning at international platforms can provide me with an avenue to do so,” she says, adding, “The achievements and recognition gained by other young Indian women athletes and sports persons like Mary Kom, Saina Nehwal, PV Sindhu, Geeta Phogat, and Mithali Raj to name a few, motivate and drive me towards my goals.” The teen champ is already working towards it. “I have started participating in national championships and training to secure a slot in the team that will be representing India in the next Asian games at Hangzhou, China (slated to take place between September 10 - 25, 2022). Also, the World Karate Association is working on getting karate to be a part of the 2024 summer Olympics to be held in Paris, France. I have set my goal to be a part of the first Indian team and use my talent to bring laurels to my country.”


 Khushi with her parents


‘I have learnt to downplay my achievements when I am part of the school gang’
‘With great power comes great responsibility’ — an adage that Khushi’s parents have instilled in her. The 13-year-old does have to deal with extra attention in school. “Whenever I win any medals (which is often), I get a lot of attention. However, my parents, teachers and friends have been very supportive and with their help, I have learnt to downplay it all, so that I can be a part of the school gang and enjoy my time in school with my friends,” she signs off.

13-year-old, another teen held for mugging, killing man near LTT 

","
MUMBAI: City police arrested two teenagers, aged 18 and 13, on Friday for killing a 22-year-old youth near LTT in the early hours of March 18. The victim was on his way to Kurla's Lokmanya Tilak Terminus to book a ticket when he was accosted by the duo who thought his bag contained valuables; they learnt later that it only had a packet of sweets, ""which they ate"". The duo threatened the victim with a chopper, and when he refused to hand over the bag, they stabbed him and fled. 


The city crime branch cracked the case with the arrest of the two habitual robbers. When caught, the duo told the police they were unaware that the man they stabbed had died. Police say this is not a stray incident as the area around LTT is notorious for such crimes and newcomers to the city are often victims. 



The deceased has been identified as Rama Yadav (22), a farmer from UP's Jaunpur. He was in Mumbai to visit his brother and mother, who suffers from pancreatitis. 

 Cops said the incident took place at Chembur-Santacruz Link Road, which is around a kilometre from LTT. Yadav was found on a footpath in a pool of blood with stab marks on his body. 


Minor first arrested when he was just nine

Passersby alerted the police control room and Kurla’s Vinobha Bhave Nagar police took Yadav to Sion Hospital where he was declared dead.

“Yadav arrived in Mumbai in February. After a month, he decided to book a ticket to return home. Around 4.30am on March 18, Yadav left his brother’s home in Kurla for LTT to avoid long queues during peak hours,” said Ashok Khot, senior inspector, crime branch Unit V.

Police said the crime was committed on Chembur-Santacruz Link Road, which is around a kilometre from LTT. Police registered a murder case and began a probe. The crime branch started a parellel probe and scanned CCTVs. Police saw blurred images of two bikers but not the registration. “We began to focus on those who target people in early morning,” said police inspector Yogesh Chavan.

“We gathered names of habitual suspects from Shivaji Nagar and picked up a few. Their interrogation led us to the two,” said Dilip Sawant, deputy commissioner of police (crime). Mohammed Sadiq (18), one of the two, stabbed Yadav. Police are yet to recover the bike and the weapon. They said both are habitual offenders with attempt to murder cases. The 13-year-old was first held when just nine for assaulting a guard with a screwdriver. Meanwhile, crime branch Unit VI on Thursday nabbed one Sameer Shaikh

(19) for looting people on SCLR. Senior inspector Aburao Sonawane said he was handed over to Vinobha Bhave Nagar police.

What’s Maharashtra CM doing? Has 11 portfolios but no time for Pansare case: HC 

","
MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Thursday frowned at CM Devendra Fadnavis, saying although he holds the home portfolio, he finds no time to take stock of the case related to the killing of CPI leader Govind Pansare.





“What is the CM doing? He holds 11 portfolios including home department but do (sic) not find the time to take stock of the case and remove obstacles and hurdles,” remarked a bench of Justices Satyaranjan Dharmadhikari and Burgess Colabawalla, which is monitoring the probe. On March 14, the court had said the attempt of the State CID’s Special Investigation Team to trace the absconding accused has been reduced to a “laughing stock.”

Counsel for the state, senior advocate Ashok Mundargi said the strength of the investigation team has been increased to nearly 35. He said top officers have reviewed the case and five meetings held. “Considering the court’s observations, we will continue with the same IO (investigating officer). His work will be reviewed every 15 days by the SIT chief,” he added. Mundargi informed the court the reward for information on the absconding accused has been increased from Rs10 to Rs50 lakh. But the judges said these were “knee-jerk reactions.” “You think if you enhance reward, results will follow? Your perception is wrong that it is the duty of the public to give you clues,” Justice Dharmadhikari said. The bench said unless they are part of a team, policemen don’t see it as a duty to crack cases. The judges said there was a time cases were cracked when policemen were on vacation. “A gentleman (Charles Sobhraj) was apprehended in Goa by officer on a vacation,” Justice Dharmadhikari said.

Mundargi said the probe team has been “more than doubled” to 35 persons, and inquiry will be speeded up. The judges said political leaders are leaders not only of a party but the state. After remarking about the CM, they asked, “What are secretaries (in home department) for?” “This is shameful you have to tell court you are getting staff and manpower.”

150 rickshaw drivers’ licences cancelled 

","
MUMBAI: RTOs have permanently cancelled 150 driving licences of errant autorickshaw drivers for refusals and cancelled 100 permits of other drivers, which is the most stringent action ever in Maharashtra till date. Till now, auto drivers would be fined or their licences suspended for two weeks but now they cannot ply autos again.

In a drive this month, 445 drivers in eastern and western suburbs were apprehended for refusing passengers “deliberately” and “leaving them stranded”. This is being done as per fresh directives from state transport commissioner Shekhar Channe. TOI has highlighted earlier this month that licences of those caught for refusals will be cancelled as per the circular. “As for the rest, their licences are being processed for cancellations and they will be given a chance to defend themselves,” a senior official said. 

“We have zero tolerance for drivers who refuse passengers, especially students, women and senior citizens. They will have to go off streets and cannot ply autos any longer,” he said. 

This is part of a month-long drive which ends this weekend. RTOs from Wadala, Andheri and Borivli offices also confiscated 117 illegal autos, which will be smashed to ensure their spare parts are not reused.Latest statistics on Thursday showed 20 cases of passengers being asked for excess fares. The RTOs are probing if meters are being tampered with following allegations of cartels of drivers in Bandra, Kurla and other places using ‘ghoda’ meters (which show inflated readings). 

Many drivers were not carrying valid documents, although they wore khakhi uniforms. “Some drivers did not have mandatory badges. We have taken stringent action, which includes hefty fines and suspension of licence,” an official who is part of the drive said. 

A total 1,049 licences have been impounded from errant drivers, while action has been taken against more than 150 drivers in Andheri, Jogeshwari, Borivli and other places, where four or more passengers were being ferried. As per rules, an auto can ferry only three passengers. 

RTO spokesperson Abhay Deshpande said, “The drive is a message to the rogues that we will not spare anyone caught for refusals, excess fares, no badge or ferrying extra passengers.” Auto union leader Shashank Rao, welcoming the initiative, said his Mumbai Autorickshawmen’s Union, the biggest in the suburbs, was willing to assist RTO squads in weeding out unscrupulous drivers.

Channe has directed RTO teams to conduct surprise checks and pose as customers to nab the culprits, sources said. The transport chief, who stays in Andheri and travels by autos occasionally, told TOI, “I am determined to end this menace.” 

Commuter rights activists have lauded RTO efforts, saying refusals are rampant outside railway stations during evening peak hours. “RTOs must be supported by traffic police, who have more staff and can deploy constables outside stations from 6pm to discipline errant drivers,” an activist said.

PIL urges Army to rebuild CSMT bridge 

","
MUMBAI: A public interest litigation was filed on Friday in the Bombay high court, seeking directions to the authorities to get the Indian Army to reconstruct the Himalaya bridge outside CSMT, that collapsed earlier this month. 


The PIL, filed by activist Kamlakar Shenoy, has asked the court to direct investigations into four accidents involving bridge since 2017. This includes the Elphinstone Road station bridge stampede that killed 23 persons and injured around 40, the Andheri bridge collapse that killed two and injured five, the collapse of a foot overbridge at Mankhurd and CSMT bridge collapse that killed six persons and injured 31. 

The PIL, which is likely to be mentioned before the HC on Monday, also sought an audit of all bridges in the city and action against officers who were responsible for maintaining the bridges. 

Another petition, filed by city resident Shakeel Shaikh, was mentioned for urgent hearing on Friday by his lawyer, Sujay Kantawala. The PIL has sought a judicial inquiry into the CSMT bridge collapse by a retired high court judge as well as action against BMC officials. The petition has further asked the court to cancel work given to the contractors for auditing 296 bridges in the city and order a fresh audit of all bridges in the city in a time-bound manner. The court has scheduled the petition for hearing on April 2.

Bombay high court may stop coastal road work if rules are broken 

","
MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday asked the Union ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) to clarify the issue of environmental clearances for the coastal road project.


The court asked the ministry to spell out its stand on two issues. First, whether the condition applies that the authorities had to undertake a study on coastal fishing habitats and on construction activity’s impact on fisherfolk’s livelihood. Second, if the study should have been done prior to the commencement of work on the project or should it be done when work is going on. “If rules are not followed, we will have to take a call on stopping work,” said the court, asking the state and BMC to place on record the policy for compensating fisherfolk. A division bench of Chief Justice Naresh Patil and Justice Nitin Jamdar was hearing a petition filed by two societies of fishermen who have sought a stop to reclamation work between Banganga and Worli.



The almost 30-km coastal road will connect Marine Lines with Kandivli. Last year, work started on a 10-km stretch from Marine Lines to Worli. Senior advocate Gayatri Singh, counsel for the petitioners, said the issue was not about compensation, but the impact of the project on the livelihood of families who depend on fishing and allied activities.

The advocate said reclamation work was being undertaken on rocky outcrops that are fish-breeding sites and before beginning the work, the authorities failed to do a study mandated by the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority and MoEF.

Senior advocates Milind Sathe and Anil Sakhare, counsels for the state and BMC, respectively, said all clearances were in place for the project. The state submitted the report of the environment-impact study that had been conducted for the project. Advocate Sathe said the study on the project’s impact on livelihood of fisherfolk was to be done along with the work. Advocate Sakhare said BMC was proposing to set up a committee that will include representatives of fisherfolk, who would frame a policy for rehabilitation and compensation of persons affected by work on the coastal road. The advocate opposed stoppage of work, saying stopping work for a day would cause a loss of Rs 11 crore. The court has scheduled the case for further hearing on April 9, 2019.

Mumbai: Newborn found in nullah gets a new life 

","
ULHASNAGAR: For the last three months, Shalini Gaikwad, a resident of Ambernath's Vadolgaon area, had been praying for the recovery of the newborn boy she had found in a nullah covered in amniotic fluid and head injury on a cold December evening. 

 Her prayers were finally answered on Thursday, when doctors at Wadia Hospital in Parel said that the infant-lovingly called Tiger for his fighting spirit-is fit and will be discharged on Friday. 

The police will then produce him before the child welfare committee (CWC), who may send him to the Nerul-based centre. Wadia doctors, through an NGO, had raised around Rs 10 lakh for Tiger's treatment. Gaikwad said, ""I am happy that Tiger will finally be out of hospital. I had been praying for his recovery.""

Ambernath couple Shivaji (35) and Jayshree Ragade (32), who also spent lakhs on Tiger's treatment at a private hospital in Ulhasnagar where he was initially admitted, wanted to adopt him. ""We would check on Tiger every day. We wanted to adopt him but dropped the idea after being informed by the CWC that they cannot just hand over the baby to us,"" said Jayshree, mother of one. ""But we are happy that Tiger is fine now."" CWC officials have allowed the Ragades to meet Tiger till he is adopted. 

On December 30, 2018, Gaikwad heard a baby's cries and was shocked to find the newborn in the drain. She alerted Shivaji, who rushed to the spot along with Jayshree. ""We informed the Ambernath police and rushed the shivering baby to state-run Central Hospital in Ulhasnagar,"" said Shivaji. ""On January 5, the CWC gave its nod and we shifted the baby to Sai Ashish Hospital. After 18 days of treatment when the baby opened his eyes for the first time, I named him Tiger for his fighting spirit,"" said Shivaji.

82% of Mumbai University LLM students fail first semester

MUMBAI: Around 82% of the 700 LLM students from Mumbai University’s law department have failed the Semester-I exam held in January. The success rate of LLM students has been dismal since 2015. 

Students have alleged discrepancies in the assessment process and sought reassessment of papers. 

Some students allegedly got a zero in one of the subjects. 

In a letter to the university, the students have claimed that merely 4% passed the LLM Semester-I exam. The university’s examination section, though, clarified that of the 1,023 students registered for the course, only 696 appeared for the exam. Of these, 18% students cleared the exam, said Vinod Malale, official spokesperson for the exam section. He said the university will look into the complaints made by the students.

The success rate in LLM exams was poor in 2017, too, when more than 85% students failed the first semester exam. The students had sought reassessment then too. In 2016, 72% students had failed the exam. Before 2015, though, the success rate had been consistent at 50%.

'Muslims must shed fear, grab opportunities'

MUMBAI: Muslims must shed their inferiority complex and the fear of being discriminated. They must grab opportunities. 


These points made up the crux of talks delivered after the launch of senior IPS officer Abdur Rahman's book 'Denial and Deprivation: Indian Muslims after the Sachar Committee and Rangnath Mishra Commission Reports' at Anjuman-I-Islam on Friday. Born into a farmer's family in a village in Bihar, Rahman joined IIT-Kanpur before he cracked the UPSC and was placed in the Maharashtra cadre as an IPS officer. 

He said he did not want to portray any particular government in a bad light but wanted to hammer home the point that there had been deep deprivation of Muslims. ""Despite the deep deprivation and denial Muslims face, people are scared to talk about it. And why Muslims alone should talk about their issues? They are integral part of the country and if India has to become a superpower, it must carry Muslims along on the path of progress,"" said Rahman, who spent three years doing research on the condition of Muslims.

If home project delayed, builder to lose right over it

The state’s real estate watchdog, MahaRERA, on Thursday issued a standard operating procedure (SOP) to allow home buyers to remove a developer in a delayed project, which will then be given to an expert panel to help complete it. The authority clarified it can take act only in non-litigated cases.

“It will help finish all delayed projects in the state. This is a unique move, probably the first in India, under Real Estate Regulatory Act, 2016, which will help the association of allottees (homebuyers) take control of the situation with help of MahaRERA,’’ Vasant Prabhu, MahaRERA secretary, told TOI.

Abdullah Khan: Mumbai's Mira Road lad lands Rs1.2 crore job at Google UK office 

","
MUMBAI: Abdullah Khan (21) of Mira Road may not have got shortlisted for JEE (Advanced) to join IIT, but he has bagged an offer that many IITians would envy. This week, the final year BE student landed a job at Google’s London office, for a package of Rs 1.2 crore. The average salary drawn at a non-IIT engineering college campus placement in the city is around Rs 4 lakh per annum.

The student of Shree L R Tiwari Engineering College was invited for an interview by Google after seeing his profile on a site that hosts competitive programming challenges. After a few online interviews, the coding junkie was called for the final screening in London this month. His package includes the base salary of 60,000 pounds (Rs 54.5 lakh) per annum, 15% bonus (Rs8.1 lakh) and stock options worth $85,000 (Rs 58.9 lakh) over four years. Khan will join Google’s site reliability engineering team in September. 




Abdullah Khan (C)

An email from a Google official received in November last year mentioned that they had seen Khan’s profile on the programming site. Explaining the job profile, it mentioned that they were looking for people for locations across Europe. Though Khan, who is doing his BE (computer science engineering), was a bit shocked initially, he showed the email to a friend, who knew someone else going through a similar process.

Khan told TOI he was not expecting such an offer when he participated in competitions on that site. “I used to participate as it was fun. I did not even know that firms check programmers’ profiles on such sites. I showed the email to my friend who knew someone who had received such an email in the past. I am looking forward to joining their team. It will be an amazing learning experience for me,” said Khan. This is not the first time he has been ranked higher for a programming contest. He has participated in over 150 such contests on several sites and even in college competitions.




Abdullah Khan being felicitated by the college trustees


‘Wasn’t shortlisted for JEE (Advanced)’

The coding junkie did his schooling in Saudi Arabia and moved to Mumbai only after Class XII. “My scores in JEE (Main) were not very impressive and I was not even shortlisted for JEE (Advanced) to get into IITs. I was not disappointed, as I was not even aware of the importance of IITs then,” he said. He later got into L R Tiwari College through the state’s centralised admission process.




Abdullah Khan being felicitated 

His college principal, S Ram Reddy, said Khan was quite a deserving candidate and he was extremely happy for him. The highest salary offered in the college through campus placement was Rs 10 lakh this year, said Reddy. Khan, too, had a job offer of Rs 6 lakh pa, which he will surrender now.

G T Thampi, principal of Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Bandra, said the average package bagged at city non-IIT engineering colleges is Rs 4 lakh. Though students have got offers from Japanese companies, a package of above Rs 1 crore is unheard of, said Thampi. He added that Indian professional colleges succeed in creating a supply chain of human capital predominantly for IT products and services industry. “Indian graduates demonstrate high-order thinking in solving real-time problems, underpinning Indian cultural sensibilities. The latter attribute is in huge demand in the global marketplace,” said Thampi.

Plea seeks contempt action for not deciding guest teachers representation: HC seeks Delhi govt's stand 

","
DELHI: The Delhi high court on Friday asked the AAP government's Directorate of Education (DoE) as to why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against it for not complying with a judicial direction to decide in three weeks the representations of 44 persons seeking to be re-engaged as guest teachers.


Justice Suresh Kait issued notice to the DoE asking why contempt proceedings be not initiated against its officials concerned for not complying with the court's direction of October 26 last year.

The judge also said that if the order is not complied with by the next date of hearing, May 14, the official concerned would be personally present in court.

The direction came on the plea by Dilli Atithi Shikshak Sangh (DASS) which has sought contempt of court action against DoE for not deciding the various representations, sent by the 44 teachers, till date.

The October order had come on the petition moved by DASS on behalf of the 44 teachers who contended that they were not re-engaged as guest teachers, though several others who were similarly placed were re-engaged.

The court had granted them liberty to move a representation to DoE and directed the department to decide on the issue within three weeks.

7 arrested for selling SIM cards on fake IDs in Delhi 

","
NEW DELHI: An inter-state gang selling SIM cards on fake identification was busted by the Delhi Police and seven people were arrested, an officer said on Friday.



Mohammad Shakeel (21), Rachit (23), Ramji Patel (21) from Kannauj, Uttar Pradesh along with Vishal (23), Prince Hinduja (25), Pankaj (23) and Manish Daima (22), all residents of Delhi were arrested by the northwest district police, they said.

The accused have sold more than 1,500 SIM cards in the last six months, the police said.

According to the officer, while probing a criminal case, it was found that the suspect's mobile number was registered in the name of a person residing in Kannuaj.

The man was questioned and it was found that the SIM card was indeed issued on the ID but he was not using it.

During further investigation, police traced down one Shakeel who used to work as a distributor with a leading telecom firm and had issued the alleged SIM card.

Shakeel was interrogated and a mobile handset was recovered from his possession in which he had used the same SIM card in January.

He used to get multiple SIM cards issued on the same set of documents after duping the customers who visited for purchasing new connections, police said.

On his instance, six others were arrested, police said.

During interrogation, it was disclosed that the accused had procured the SIM cards from Uttar Pradesh, Vijayanta Arya, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Northwest), said.

They generally procured 200-250 SIM cards in a month and would supply them in Delhi and other cities to criminals and persons running call centres for illegal activities, the DCP said.

A total of 203 SIM cards, 11 mobile phones and a laptop were recovered from their possession, they added.

IndiGo flight diverts to Kuwait after PW engine develops snag 

","
NEW DELHI: An IndiGo flight operating from Delhi to Istanbul had to divert to Kuwait on Friday after getting a snag warning in one of the two Pratt & Whitney (PW) engines powering the Airbus A320 Neo.

Directorate General of Civil Aviation is probing the latest trouble in the snag-prone PW engines of A320/321 new engine option (Neo) aircraft. 

“An A320 NEO en-route Delhi to Istanbul had to divert to Kuwait due to engine-related technical reasons. The root cause is yet to be determined,” an IndiGo spokesperson said. “The aircraft landed safely in Kuwait and IndiGo local representatives are currently taking care of the passengers and crew.” 

The airline is trying to use the next possible connecting flight out of Kuwait to Istanbul to help the passengers reach their destination, he added. “Customers in Istanbul who are booked on this flight back to Delhi will be accommodated with Turkish Airlines. We expect normal operations on Istanbul flights on Saturday.”

The Istanbul-bound aircraft had flown from Delhi to Doha for a fuelling stop, a route taken due to Pakistan’s airspace closure. “After taking off from Doha, the pilots got low oil pressure warning — one of the most recurring snags in PW engines — in the plane’s number two engine. They carried out an inflight shutdown of the engine and landed safely at the nearest airport on one engine. The aircraft has been grounded there,” said a source. The plane had already cleared Persian Gulf on its way to Istanbul, show flight-tracking websites. 

IndiGo had started the Istanbul flight on March 20 using A321 Neo. In the last nine days, the A320/321s used on this route have seen at least two engine snags. In the first instance, the engine experienced vibration and was replaced after landing in Delhi safely.

IndiGo had announced it would have a double daily from March 25 on the Delhi-Istanbul-Delhi route. However, it hadn’t started yet and it is not clear if it has been postponed due to constant snags in PW engines. 

The engines of the A320 Neo series, including A321s, have been plagued with snags for almost three years now. Due to this, aviation regulators, both abroad and in India, have from time to time issued advisories for it. DGCA does not allow PW-powered A320 Neos to fly to Port Blair.

 Both IndiGo and GoAir get hefty compensations from PW when aircraft are grounded due to engine trouble.

Delhi: Trio took on guise of people they robbed 

","
NEW DELHI: With youthful exuberance, these three men tried out different guises and modus operandi to rob people they gave a lift to in their car at night. Once a man they targeted in west Delhi turned out to a lawyer. They divested him of his belongings and then began posing as black-coated lawyers to stop and rob unsuspecting people. If they were questioned, they flashed the Bar Council of India identity card they had taken from their lawyer victim.

In a similar fashion, they robbed a policeman and began going out on their nightly excursions in the guise of cops. One of them would wear a police uniform they took from their victim and sit in the front seat of their car, a reassuring sight for people who wouldn’t then hesitate to accept the lift.

This gang was finally reined in on Friday. The kingpin, Dalip, is just 18 years old, while Aniket is 19 and Rajkumar 20. All three are school dropouts living in MehramNagar and Qutub Vihar in south-west Delhi. 

The gang operated on the roads between Dhaula Kuan and Chanakyapuri at night, using their Maruti Eeco van and Maruti WagonR car in turns to avoid being identified. As one drove, the other two posed as passengers. The person driving the car would pull over whenever he sighted people stranded on the street and negotiated a fare with them. 

Once in the car, the lift-taker would find a gun staring at him. Any resistance would be met with assault. The trio then robbed the victim of his belongings and later threw him off the car at an isolated spot.

Several police units went on the gang’s trail after the lawyer and policeman lost their belongings to the robbers. Both had been divested of their phones, watches, wallets, cash and identity cards. The breakthrough came on Friday.

“A team led by ACP Kulbir Singh and SHO Chhawla Aishvir Singh received a tipoff that criminals involved in robberies would assemble at Qutub Vihar and proceed to commit a crime. Sub-inspector Gajender Meena and his team were prepared to intercept them in the Goyla Dairy area,” disclosed Anto Alphonse, DCP (Dwarka), on Friday.

The three men were spotted riding a motorcycle and flagged down. They tried to speed away but were overpowered by the police team. The bike turned out to be a stolen one. The cops seized a pistol, knife, watch and mobile phones, apart from the police uniform that they had stolen from their police victim’s bag.

14 held for duping scores in US with fake call centre 

","
NEW DELHI: The CyPad unit of the Delhi Police’s Special Cell has arrested 14 people for running a fake call centre and duping victims based in US and Canada on the pretext of helping them with technical support in installing products from Amazon and Netflix. 


The accused would take remote access of the victim’s computer to ‘fix’ their problems and plant a malware in their systems that would start popping up error messages on their screens.

The fraudsters would then force their victims to pay service charges to remove the malware. The men, identified as Akash, Shahbaz, Parvind Singh, Abhishek, Avinash, Deepak Pal, Gaurav Kudia, Mithun, Navneet Sharma, Bishwajit Swain, Ankur Dhirta, Ranjeet Singh, Raj Kumar and Raj Kumar Lal, ran the call centre from a house in Kirti Nagar.

During interrogation, the men revealed that sometimes they would also cheat US and Canadian citizens by telling them that their iPhones are under attack by hackers and induce them to buy Google Play gift cards worth several hundred US dollars. 

They stay on call with the victims for up to 6-8 hours in order to establish confidence with their targets and appear genuinely concerned to help tthem. As soon as the target shared the number of the gift cards, they disconnected the call and blocked the victim’s number.

Romanian held for cloning cards in Delhi 

","
NEW DELHI: A 40-year-old Romanian has been arrested for allegedly cheating people by cloning their debit cards.

The passport and visas of the suspect, Lupoi Emil, revealed that he has visited India thrice in the last one year. In the second week of March, he and his associates got a multiple visitor visa after which they rented a room in Green Park.

Emil’s gang used to install cloning devices at ATMs to extract customer card data. They would then embed this information on blank cards and withdraw money fraudulently. The customer would be clueless about the withdrawals as the original card would be in his possession. Their racket was busted after Emil was nabbed red-handed while installing a skimmer at a kiosk in south Delhi.

A police team analysed CCTV footage of suspected ATMs and started keeping a watch on them while investigating cases in which people had lost money due to unauthorised withdrawals from their accounts.

They tracked the Romanian to a Yes Bank ATM in Saidulajab on MB Road. Apart from a skimming device, police seized two keypads used for copying the PIN of ATM users and five illegal ATM cards, including two cloned ones, from Emil. A bag having a double-sided tape, iron plate, a cap to hide face during installation, mobile phone and Rs 18,220 was also seized from him, police said.

During interrogation, Emil said his gang would select unguarded ATMs at isolated spots and install the skimmers and their own keypad. They would take out the original keypad using a sharp knife. Police suspect the gang may have duped more than a dozen people using their modus operandi.

The mobile phone of the suspect will be sent for forensics analysis to get more information about the gang’s network.

Delhi: Cluster bus staffer ends life on railway tracks 

","
NEW DELHI: A cluster bus conductor allegedly committed suicide by jumping in front of a train near Kanjhawala railway station. 

In a note, Hari Darshan has alleged that he was being harassed by the depot manager of the Kanjhawala depot over low passenger count in the bus for the past few months. His family members claim that the man was also allegedly penalised after he protested against the torture. Police said that the manager would be questioned regarding the incident.

Cops were informed about the suicide when the driver of a Maha Kaushal Express, going towards the Sarai Rohilla railway station, reported hitting a man who had suddenly jumped infront. A police team from the Sarai Rohilla railway police station found a man with injuries on his head near the Ghewra railway crossing.

During an inquiry, cops found some ID cards and a suicide note. In the note, Hari Darshan mentioned that he was depressed by the behaviour of the depot manager. The body has been shifted to the Subzi Mandi mortuary and his family has contacted.

“Darshan was depressed due to the harassment. He had told his wife about it and would often stay away from work so that he did not have to face the depot manager,” said Naveen, his cousin.

Darshan has been working with the DIMTS for the past three years and had even taken up a house near Nihal Vihar to reach work early. “We will give a detailed complaint regarding the harassment to the police,” said Naveen.

He was the only earning member of his family and recently celebrated the birth of his daughter a few months ago. He also used to look after his disabled brother and elderly parents.

“We have initiated an inquiry into the incident and would conduct a postmortem examination on Saturday. A case will be registered once the inquiry is complete,” said D K Gupta, DCP (railways).

Following the incident, there was tension at the Kanjhawala bus depot as employees threatened to go on protest against the depot manager, who they allege was harassing some other employees as well.

Delhi BJP alleges corruption in Waqf Board, Amanatullah Khan denies 

","
NEW DELHI: The BJP on Thursday alleged corruption in the Delhi Waqf Board and accused its chairman and AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan of handing over Waqf properties worth over Rs 100 crore to unauthorised persons without following due process, a charge denied by the latter. Leader of Opposition in the Delhi assembly Vijender Gupta alleged that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is turning a blind eye to the serious ""corruption and rampant irregularities of criminal nature of his MLA"". 


 Gupta urged Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal to immediately institute a CBI inquiry into the working of the board. 

 He demanded that all land and financial transactions be stopped henceforth. 

 ""Amanatullah Khan has recently handed over Waqf properties worth at least 100 crore rupees to unauthorised persons without following due process. He is guilty of unlawfully creating and filling up 36 posts of different categories in Delhi Waqf Board with his relatives, friends and favourites,"" Gupta said. 

 He is trying to unlawfully open bank accounts in the name of the board to siphon off huge sums for his personal gratification, he alleged. 

 Though the chief executive officer is a statutory signing authority in financial matters, Khan is bypassing him, he added. 

 Gupta alleged that Waqf premises were rented out without following due process. 

 Khan termed the allegations ""baseless"" and challenged Gupta to prove the claims. 

 ""CBI, ED, every investigation agency is with them. They can get the allegations probed. Why don't they want the Waqf Board to function. There has been undue interference,"" he said. 

 Khan said that he has not rented out any new properties in the last two years and the old tenancies are continuing.

No maternity leave to ad-hoc women professors in DU: Plea in HC 

","
NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Friday sought a response of the Delhi University on a plea which alleged that the varsity was not providing maternity leave to its ad hoc women professors.



The petition, by a woman professor of Aurbindo College here, contended that under the Maternity Benefit Act she was entitled to six months leave, but the varsity did not grant her the relief as she was not a permanent employee and was employed on an ad hoc basis.

She also claimed that the Supreme Court had held that maternity benefits are available to all irrespective of the type of employment -- permanent or contractual.

Taking note of the submissions made by the petitioner, Justice Suresh Kait observed that according to the apex court judgement and the act, she was entitled to maternity leave and asked the lawyer for DU to take instructions on the issue.

With the direction, the court listed the matter for further hearing on April 10.

In her plea, the woman has claimed that she had sent several representations to the university since January 4 seeking grant of maternity leave as her expected date of delivery was February 22.

However, no response was received from DU and meanwhile, she gave birth on February 3.

Since then she has been on leave without pay as the varsity did not sanction her request for maternity leave, her lawyer told the court.

DU's lawyer told the court that her contract was renewed every four months and at present it stands expired on March 18.

The lawyer also said it was a policy decision of the varsity to provide the benefit to only its permanent employees.

Kriti Sanon: Whenever I cross Shanti Path, it feels so peaceful. I love Delhi’s roads 

","
Kriti Sanon loves being in Delhi, and every time someone welcomes her to “our city”, she is quick to point out, “It’s my city as well.” It sure is Kriti studied engineering in Noida and has a house in Patparganj now. But despite calling the capital home, she admits the city does feel alien to her when she visits after a long time, as it keeps changing. “It happens so often that at times, I get confused while going home. In general in NCR, there are so many new roads, new flyovers, new exits that it gets confusing if you are visiting after a while. So it happens that I am on my way home in East Delhi and jo cut tha mere ghar ke liye, woh abhi kahin aur hai. It has happened so many times that I’m in a cab and I get so confused that I have to use Google Maps. Imagine using maps to go to your own house,” she says with a laugh.
But the 'Bareily Ki Barfi' actress says there are lots of positives about returning to Delhi. She tells us, “Whenever I cross Shanti Path in a car, it feels so peaceful. I love these roads and I get so nostalgic and so happy. Delhi mein when I’m in a car, toh main khidki se bahar hi dekh rahi hoti hoon.” Of course, having been used to the wide roads of Delhi-NCR, Kriti says she took quite a while to adjust to Mumbai. She recalls, “When I shifted to Mumbai, the first question I asked my dad was, ‘where are the main roads?’ I genuinely felt the main roads there were galiyan. Because when you go from Delhi, you feel only this wide a road can be a main road.”

Cluster bus takes third life in a month; biker crushed in east Delhi 

","
NEW DELHI: Weeks after 27-year-old Arun Kumar got married and took up employment in south Delhi, a rashly driven bus shattered the dreams of his family when he was on his way to work on Wednesday morning. Kumar, knocked down from his motorcycle by the bus near Ghazipur, was run over and dragged for some metres before the driver brought the bus to a halt.


Onlookers were horrified by the accident, but no one took the trouble to inform the cops. It was only later that a woman driving by noticed and phoned the police control room. But by the time the cops responded, Kumar had died. Eyewitnesses claimed seeing an earphone plugged in Kumar’s ears and surmised that he had not heard the bus approaching from behind.

Cluster bus driver Devendra Singh was caught from the vicinity while he was searching for an autorickshaw in an apparent bid to flee from the spot. 

This was the third fatal incident this month involving cluster buses.

Members of Kumar’s family reached the accident site and found his motorcycle standing by the road side. The body was handed over to them after an autopsy on Thursday.

Father Ghanshyam Singh said his son had quit his job before his marriage on March 3 and subsequently found new employment with a private company in Okhla. “He used to leave home early in order to attend a training session at the new office,” he said. “He returned late at night, so we did not inquire about his whereabouts until the cops contacted us.”

Kumar had left home for work as usual on his motorbike and would have reached his office after an hour. There was some worry for the family when, as his brother, Rajiv, related, his phone suddenly stopped responding to their calls. Later that night, the cops asked the family to reach Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital with someone who could identify Kumar. “He was dead when we reached the hospital,” said Rajeev.

According to eyewitnesses, around 8.30am, Kumar’s bike was hit from behind by bus no. 211 headed for Mayur Vihar. The 27-year-old was flung into the air and fell heavily on the road. The bus then ran over the lower portion of his body and dragged him for a distance. He lay injured on the road for at least half an hour before police were informed, all this while catching the attention of people who shot videos of him but none coming forward to help him.

Bus driver Singh claimed that when trying to overtake the bike, he found stray cattle blocking the road. He was driving at some speed and consequently lost control of the bus. A case for causing death due to negligence has been registered against him. The bus has been impounded.

‘No new scheme once poll code is in place’ 

","
NEW DELHI: Former chief election commissioner SY Quraishi on Thursday said that after the model code of conduct is in place, no new announcement or scheme can be introduced as it can influence voters. He was replying to a query about a committee set up on Wednesday by the poll panel to look into PM Narendra Modi’s speech.


Talking at a workshop on “political campaigning on social media and issues of paid news”, Quraishi said, “When a proposal comes, we see if it can wait. If the scheme is prescheduled, an official will announce it and not the minister so that the political advantage can be neutralised. I have seen the PMO ask the election commission if they can make an important announcement because no PM wants to be embarrassed.”

Asked whether EC can take notice of issues like the PM’s biopic suo motu, Quraishi said, “The EC cannot, but it doesn’t need to as there are always enough complaints that come up to take cognizance and act.”

The workshop, hosted by east and south districts, was attended by four district magistrates of Delhi. The returning officer and DM of east district, K Mahesh, said, “Political messaging over the internet has the potential to reach roughly half the population directly. It is this reality that makes the 2019 election unlike any other.” The east district administration had recently issued a notice to a BJP MLA for using his photograph along with Wing Commander Abhinandan’s on social media.

Cluster bus accident: It was business as usual for this driver 

","
NEW DELHI: The driver of a cluster bus who ran over a teacher in Ghaziabad drove his vehicle to the depot like nothing had happened. He did not report the accident but continued working as usual for over 10 days. On Wednesday, when Surendra Kumar, the teacher, died of the injuries he had sustained, police also caught up with the drive and arrested him.


Kumar, a Ghaziabad resident, had come to Delhi to consult a doctor on March 16. When the cluster bus stopped near Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital in Dilshad Garden, the 54-year-old let other passenger alight first before following them. He was getting down when the driver suddenly accelerated, throwing him off balance. He fell on the road and came under the wheels of the bus.

Some passengers alerted the bus driver, who drove his bus a short distance before halting. The crowd pulled Kumar from under the bus. He had suffered spinal and other injuries and was taken to GTB Hospital. In the melee, the bus drove away without anyone recording its registration number.

A few days later, the cops managed to identify Kumar from a card they found in his wallet and contacted his angst-ridden family. They asked his wife, Babita, who stays in Meerut, to reach Delhi. She and other relatives reached the hospital on March 20 and shifted him to a village in Noida. Kumar’s condition deteriorated, however, and he died on Wednesday.

In the meantime, a passenger approached the police station with a phone he had picked up at the accident site. It turned out to be Kumar’s and contained a photo that the teacher had taken of the bus and its driver. 

This helped the cops trace the bus and the driver on Wednesday. 

A case of causing death due to negligence was registered against the driver.

Delhi: Corporations don’t agree on poll code limits 

","
NEW DELHI: The model code of conduct doesn’t seem to apply uniformly on three municipal corporations in Delhi. While the east corporation suspended its meeting on Friday, its north and south counterparts have been taking various decisions even after the declaration of the Lok Sabha elections.

East corporation mayor Bipin Bihari Singh told TOI that an opinion over the legality of House and standing committee meetings was sought from the election commission but no reply had come yet. “Delhi Municipal Corporation Act mandates at least one meeting in a month. To fulfil it, we decided to call the house for five minutes and suspend it without taking any decision.” 

After the south corporation’s law department cleared certain actions, its House, on March 15, okayed two puzzle parking projects. However, opposition AAP and Congress termed it a blatant violation of the code of conduct. Congress has also complained to EC. 

Mayor Narendra Chawla said only those agenda items not violating the poll code were passed. The north corporation also passed several agenda items on Thursday. 

Questions are also being raised over the appointment of new mayors and committees due next month. However, a senior official said appointments won’t be an issue.

RWAs, agencies must fix residential parking rates 

","
NEW DELHI: The pricing for residential parking should be determined jointly by the local agency and RWA or shopkeepers association but it must be based on the principle of charging differential and higher rates for additional cars. This was recommended by Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) to the apex court for the parking policy in the city on Friday.





The panel also recommended that the local parking plan must ensure there is a provision for movement of emergency vehicles and green areas, parks and footpaths should not be allowed for parking.

“Parking in residential areas must be the joint responsibility of local agencies, namely the corporations, DDA and other land-owning agencies, RWAs and shopkeepers associations. Based on the parking management plan, the role and responsibility of RWAs and other organisations like local shopkeeper associations should be clearly identified.

“The area must be jointly managed to ensure coordination between different road types — service roads, residential lanes and commercial and mixed land use areas. If, this is not done, then there will be problems of spill over – if residential areas demarcate parking and provide permits, but this is not done in mixed land use areas, then vehicles will simply move from one to the other and add to congestion and law-order problems,” EPCA said. 

The Supreme Court had earlier disapproved of the proposal to charge residents for parking cars outside their houses in residential colonies, saying such a policy was not feasible and impractical to implement.

“How practical it is that one cannot park outside his residence? Can it ever be implemented? How can you restrain people from parking beside their houses?” a bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Deepak Gupta had said.A new parking policy —‘Delhi Maintenance and Management of Parking Rules, 2017’— was framed on the SC’s direction but Delhi government dropped controversial provisions, which stated that parking in residential colonies would be allowed only in demarcated areas on public spaces against parking charges. The government also did away with the provision which said parking for commercial establishments in residential areas shall be separately marked and charged.

Need ‘Hum Do Hamare Do’ for cars to make Delhi liveable: SC 

","
NEW DELHI: With the number of vehicles in the national capital crossing the one crore mark and increasing by over seven lakh every year, the Supreme Court on Friday said there should a family planning policy like ‘Hum Do Hamare Do’ to stop people from buying multiple cars.





A bench of Arun Mishra and Deepak Gupta expressed concern over Delhi residents owning multiple cars, resulting in congestion on roads and pollution. It said the number of cars and other vehicles in the city needed to be brought down to make Delhi a liveable place.

“It is fine to have multiple cars in a family where there are many earning members but now there are instances where one person has five or more cars. Neighbourhood relationships are nowadays getting destroyed due to growing vehicle population as people keep fighting for parking space in colonies. Can’t we have a family planning policy for cars like ‘Hum Do Hamare Do’?” the bench asked.

The court was hearing an application filed by Bajaj Auto seeking removal of the cap on autorickshaws in the city which the SC had fixed at one lakh. It claimed that BS-VI compliant autorickshaws were less polluting and the curb should be removed as it would strengthen the public transport system.

Supporting the company’s plea, the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority told the court that increase in the number of three-wheelers would help control pollution as people would be discouraged to buy cars. 

Referring to the EPCA report, advocate Aparajita Singh said the per-capita emission of public transport vehicles was lower than private vehicles and they also travelled longer distances every day. “It is estimated that while two-wheelers and cars travel some 50-60 km per day on an average, three-wheelers travel 120 km/day, buses 210 km/day and taxis like Ola and Uber some 400 km/day. The cap on registration of three-wheelers may be removed immediately provided that the vehicles are BS-VI CNG/petrol/LPG etc or battery operated,” the report said.

The EPCA told the court that the situation was worse in NCR cities of Faridabad, Noida and Gurgaon which were witnessing proliferation of unregistered vehicles for public transport running on polluting fuel due to the cap on number of three-wheelers. It said there were around three lakh registered three-wheelers in the NCR, including Delhi, of which 84,000 were diesel and 54,000 were fuelled by CNG. The rest were powered by petrol or duel-fuel (CNG-petrol). 

The court, however, expressed reluctance to remove the cap and said it may lead to a flood of autorickshaws on the roads. “Other vehicles also require space. Only autos cannot run on the roads. It is not easy and feasible to lift the ban all of a sudden. The number can be increased as per the needs of a growing city but there has to be some empirical data to justify raising the cap,” it said.

In 1997, the Supreme Court had put a cap of 82,138 on the number of three-wheelers in Delhi and had subsequently raised it to one lakh.

SEE Learning is a new education programme developed at Emory University in Atlanta, USA with the help of experts in developmental psychology, education and neuroscience, as well as with the vision and support of the Dalai Lama. The programme is a comprehensive framework for the cultivation of social, emotional and ethical competencies as well as age-specific curricula for K-12 schools and a programme support structure for educator preparation and development. 

In his foreword to SEE Learning Companion, the Dalai Lama has said “to involve the whole of humanity, we need an ethical approach with universal appeal, a secular ethics that nurtures such basic human values as empathy, tolerance, forgiveness and love”. 

Recent research has shown that such values can be cultivated through learning and practice on the basis of common sense, experience and scientific findings, he added. “They can be integrated in heart and mind not through the enforcement of rules, but through the voluntary application of reason and investigation.”

With the vision of “a compassionate and ethical world for all”, SEE Learning is the first social and emotional learning programme to explicitly focus on the cultivation of compassion, other basic human values and “ethical intelligence”, provide developmentally appropriate methods for attention training, include “system thinking” at all levels of education and incorporate a resilience and trauma-informed approach.

Desilting delayed in south Delhi as EC’s nod not received 

","
NEW DELHI: The model code of conduct imposed in the capital in the run-up to polling for the parliamentary elections on May 12 is coming in the way of routine work. Or that’s what officials would have us believe. What could be more routine than cleaning of drains before the rains arrive, usually at the end of June. Any delay in this can lead to severe waterlogging in the city, affecting normal life.

Believe it or not, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) is yet to secure approval from the Delhi state election commission to initiate the tendering process for this job. The work should have started at the beginning of March to ensure it is completed by June 15. There is already a one-month delay. South Delhi’s roads and underpasses witness a lot of waterlogging during monsoon and this delay can prove costly. 

There are 246 drains in SDMC’s jurisdiction that are more than four feet deep. These include 28 major drains like the ones at Maharani Bagh, Chirag Delhi, Sriniwaspuri, Subhash Nagar and Anand Lok besides the Kushak and Barapullah nullahs. While the drains that are less deep are desilted throughout the year by the sanitation staff, the civic agencies have to hire or give out contracts to clean drains which are deeper. 

“Since the model code of conduct is in force, we decided to approach the state election commission early this month for permission to undertake desilting work,” said a senior SDMC official. This approval was sought under the consolidated guidelines of model code of conduct that allow carrying necessary works such as repair of embankments and water channels only with the election commission’s approval, added the official. 

“But the state election commission didn’t give permission and instead asked us to pursue the matter with the screening committee constituted under the chairmanship of the chief secretary, Delhi government. The committee will decide on the relevance of the issue and then forward the request to the EC. But the process will take time and might delay work for desiliting major drains,” claimed the official. TOI couldn’t speak to the chief secretary despite attempts.

The chief electoral officer (CEO) of Delhi, Ranbir Singh, said: “Under the model code of conduct, no new projects can be approved by the government as it can influence the voters in the area in favour of the ruling party. But if there is any task which may affect people and their lives or some preventive measures which are important to mitigate the likely effects of natural disasters, we are ready to consider them provided proper process is followed,” he said.

Singh pointed out that they would in due course send the file with remarks to the Election Commission of India which will finally decide on the matter.

East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) says it anticipated this problem and did tendering before the model code of conduct was enforced. “We knew that such a situation will occur since it is an election year. That’s why we planned everything in advance. However, in some cases we did approach the screening committee and the members gave approval after verifying the matter,” said a senior EDMC official.

The EDMC got approval for desilting 222 drains more than four feet deep. These include major drains at Gokalpur and Mandoli.

Elderly man beaten up in tiff over parking slot 

","
NEW DELHI: An argument over a parking spot escalated into a brawl leading to a 63-year-old man being beaten up with a baseball bat in west Delhi’s Hari Nagar on Wednesday evening. The victim was hospitalised with fractures in his body.


DCP (west) Monika Bhardwaj said the victim has been identified as Mahinder Pal Singh. A case of attempt to commit culpable homicide and causing hurt has been registered.

Mahinder’s son, Simranpreet Singh (26), said the argument started when he asked their neighbour Ramesh Chopra to move his motorcycle so that he could park his Maruti Baleno car. Chopra allegedly refused after which they started arguing. The verbal duel got worse when Chopra’s son Manish joined in.

Seeing the situation turning bad, Mahinder came down to intervene. Chopra and Manish then assaulted them with a baseball bat. “They abused my father. When I asked them to watch their mouths, they turned aggressive. They said let’s end the matter once and for all as we have been bothering them about parking for long,” Simranpreet said. The elderly man was hit on his arms, legs and head.

Local residents came out and tried to control the situation. The accused then fled the spot. The injured father and son were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment and the cops were called.

Senior officers said they recorded the statements of the victims and a case was registered at Hari Nagar police station. The investigating teams are scanning CCTV footage of the area to ascertain the sequence of events. The statements of the neighbours have also been recorded. A probe has revealed that the two neighbours used to frequently argue over the limited parking space. The family members of the absconding accused are being quizzed to know their location.

Weatherman predicts a high of 37°C 

","
NEW DELHI: The overall air quality index (AQI) of the city was recorded at 232 on Friday, which falls under the 'poor' category, according to data from Central Pollution Control Board. 

The Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting (SAFAR) also said the overall air quality over Delhi is in the 'poor' category. On Thursday, it was recorded in the 'moderate' category. The maximum temperature on Friday touched 36.9 degrees Celsius, five notches above normal and the highest yet this season. The previous highest was 35.5 degrees Celsius on Thursday. 

According to officials from the regional meteorological department, an active western disturbance is also passing through Delhi that has increased the moisture content and could lead to 'thundery development' on Saturday.

The maximum and minimum temperatures will be around 37 and 19 degree Celsius respectively,"" a Met official said.

""As predicted by SAFAR, this deterioration is attributed to medium to long range transport of dust from the western side of Delhi (including Rajasthan and Afghanistan) due to favourable upper wind conditions,"" a SAFAR report said.

Delhi cops draw flak as government delays sanction 

","
NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Friday pulled up Delhi Police after it did not file a report over the delay in procuring sanction from Delhi government in the 2016 JNU sedition case. 

Chief Metropolitan Magistrate issued summons to the DCP concerned to appear and explain the delay in getting the requisite sanction against former JNUSU president and CPI member Kanhaiya Kumar and others.

On March 11, the court had questioned the police over the delay and said the proceedings could go ahead. The investigating officer in the case was absent and when the court inquired about the reason, the prosecutor said he had met with an accident. 

The prosecutor reiterated that the government was yet to give its nod on the sanction following which Kumar, Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya could be prosecuted. They were chargesheeted by Delhi Police on January 14 and were accused of allegedly leading a procession and raising seditious slogans on the varsity campus during an event in February 2016.

According to CrPC Section 196, for the court to take cognisance in a sedition case, the police have to get a government sanction. 

Earlier, the court had said that its precious time was being wasted as the decision to grant sanction hanged fire. “After filing the chargesheet, no department can sit on its hands with the file with regard to the sanction,” the CMM said. 

“The department concerned will do well to speed up the matter,” the court said adding, that adjournments were being sought on the ground that the process of obtaining sanction was underway. The investigating officer had said the grant of sanction was now only ‘a matter of days’ as assured by the government.

Delhi cop caught taking bribe from man he 'framed' 

","
NEW DELHI: A Delhi Police constable, posted with the Vasant Vihar police station, was arrested by the anti-corruption branch of CBI after he was caught red-handed demanding a bribe. 

 The cop wanted Rs 10,000 from a man whom he had framed in a false case of carrying illicit liquor in a car on Thursday. CBI sources said that the victim approached them after constable Dharmender let him off on condition that he would pay the money soon after the release.

His car too, was impounded at the police station. The victim said that Dharmender let them victim's family members take away the car after they promised to pay him Rs 20,000. 

 The victim was, however, locked up at the police station and produced at a court the next morning. The judge ordered his release. However, Dharmender caught him and claimed that he had found a stock of illicit liquor in the car and kept it aside. He promised to let him go if he paid Rs 10,000. The victim left to come back with money. He reached the CBI office in Ghaziabad and filed a complaint.

IIC election for trustee chair may land in court 

","
NEW DELHI: Election for the individual trustee’s chair on the India International Centre (IIC) board looks set to land in court. L K Joshi, who had emerged as the winner with two votes more than his nearest competitor at the end of counting, has threatened to take the issue to court after three votes were declared ‘invalid’ during recounting, which has now pushed him to the second spot.

Joshi, a sitting trustee in the individual category, was seeking re-election. Joshi has alleged that norms were flouted when votes were recounted on Thursday afternoon and also claimed that there was a deliberate attempt to overturn the election result using the ploy of ‘invalid votes’. IIC officials said this was the first time a recounting of votes took place as the winning margin was “too less” and they claimed norms were followed during the recount. 

 Joshi got 221 votes, while his nearest competitor social scientist Ashis Nandy got 219. 

“This recounting was not asked for by me nor Nandy, to the best of my knowledge. During recounting they said that three votes were invalid. This was quite shocking since the invalid votes were already taken out after thorough checking before the counting of votes began before lunch. During recounting, you don’t scrutinise anything except the number of votes and there was no change,” Joshi said.

He said he had requested to see how the three votes were found invalid during recounting but was denied. IIC president N N Vohra, the former J&K governor, is also in the election panel. 

But IIC director K N Srivastava said the counting and recounting of votes were conducted by the panel and two independent observers. He said more invalid votes were detected as there was a thorough scrutiny during the recounting. Srivastava said though Joshi had sought to verify the ‘invalid’ votes he was told it could not be done because of IIC’s bylaws. “So, the invalid votes were sealed in an envelope. Joshi wrote to us flagging his concerns and these were brought before the election committee. Both Joshi and Nandy were present in the meeting on Friday. The scrutinizers tried to explain why the votes were found invalid. But Joshi refused to see. These votes were resealed,” Srivastava said. 

The matter is likely to come up for discussion at IIC’s annual general body meeting on Saturday.

Paid on km basis, these drivers are always in a rush 

","
NEW DELHI: Buses operating under the cluster system are increasingly earning the notoriety once reserved for the Blueline buses. While police have been asking Delhi Integrated Multi-modal Transit System Ltd, which monitors these buses, to rein in the rash drivers, little has been done. Not surprisingly, last year cluster buses were involved in 17 fatal accidents.



The buses sporting an orange colour and driven by employees of private concessionaires but monitored by DIMTS pay scant to road rules, speeding beyond the permitted limits, violating lane discipline and ignoring traffic signals, often in competition with the DTC buses operating on the same routes. They were behind the death of 17 people in 2018, itself a doubling of the number they killed in 2017.

Delhi has around 1,600 cluster buses on the roads every day. Their dangerous antics have defeated the rationale behind the scheme, which was to allow one concessionaire to drive in a particular cluster of routes to avert any sort of competition leading to speeding and rash driving. However, the private concessionaires are paid by Delhi government on a per kilometre basis with the cluster buses expected to complete a certain number of trips in a day. According to transport department officials, the cluster scheme drivers speed to complete their trips as early as possible.

“Even though there are no incentives given to the drivers for reaching their destinations early, they speed purely to make free time before the next trip,” explained a police officer. During the peak hours, cops rarely stop the errant drivers for fear that an idling bus will stall the traffic on the road. It is also at the peak hours, therefore, that most violations take place, said traffic police officers.

When contacted, the DIMTS spokesperson didn’t take calls or respond to text messages.

While their counterparts in DTC face serious consequences if their buses get involved in accidents, the cluster bus drivers face more lenient penalties at the hands of their private employers, which only emboldens them. And though DIMTS claimed to have fitted GPS devices to track the movement of all its buses, in reality such devices rarely work. A transport department official said, “By tracking the cluster buses through GPS, we realised that they usually run at a speed of around 60 kmph when the prescribed limit is 40 kmph.”

Delhi: Season’s hottest day yet, mercury touches 35.5 degrees Celsius 

","
NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded the hottest day of the season so far with the maximum temperature touching 35.5 degrees Celsius on Thursday — three notches above normal for this time of the season. The IMD, however, says mercury is likely to rise even further in the next 48 hours, crossing 37 degrees Celsius by Saturday.


The season’s highest temperature so far has been 34.1 degrees Celsius, which was recorded on March 20, 2019. According to officials from the regional meteorological department, an active western disturbance is also passing through Delhi that has increased the moisture content and could lead to ‘thundery development’ on Saturday.

“This was the warmest day of the season so far and the temperature will only rise further in the next two days. It will be 37 degrees Celsius by Saturday before overcast conditions occur. Some parts may also see very light rain due to this,” said a senior Met official.

Delhi’s minimum temperature on Thursday was recorded at 16.2 degrees Celsius, while relative humidity oscillated between 32% and 92% in the last 24 hours. The increase in humidity, however, led to deterioration in Delhi’s air quality, which was classified as ‘poor’ according to CPCB’s index.

SAFAR, a body under the ministry of earth sciences that classified air quality to be in the ‘moderate’ category on its index, said further deterioration was likely in the next two days.

“There is a slim possibility of long-range transport of mineral dust from Thar desert by March 29-30,” said SAFAR.

The forecast for Friday says that the maximum and minimum temperatures will be 36 and 17 degrees Celsius respectively, with strong surface winds likely during the day, an official added.

SC upholds life term for Saravana Bhavan owner 

","
NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the conviction and life sentence awarded to P Rajagopal, owner of popular south Indian restaurant chain Saravana Bhavan, for murdering one of his employees 18 years ago to take the widow as his third wife. 

A bench of Justices N V Ramana, Mohan M Shantanagoudar and Indira Banerjee took note of the circumstantial and forensic evidence, including DNA reports, to conclude that Rajagopal, with the help of four others, had planned and executed the kidnapping and murder of Shathakumar in 2001 to enable him to fulfil his desire of marrying Shantakumar's wife.

 The SC gave details of Rajagopal's obsession with taking the married woman as his third wife. ""Rajagopal is the proprietor of Saravana Bhavan. Either upon the advice of an astrologer or having become besotted with the woman, he had evinced a keen desire to take her as his third wife, though she was already mar ried to Santhakumar.

Three held for robbing advocate and Delhi Police constable

NEW DELHI: Three youths were arrested for allegedly robbing an advocate and a Delhi Police constable in Dhaula Kuan and Chankya Puri areas, officials said on Friday. The accused have been identified as Aniket (19), Rajkumar (20) and Dalip Kumar (18), they said. 


The arrests were made at around 9 pm Thursday, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Dwarka) Anto Alphonse said. 

During interrogation, the accused persons said they have committed many robberies in Dhaula Kuan and Chanya Puri areas during night. 

They disclosed that on the intervening night of March 22 and 23, they targeted one advocate near 11 Murti and robbed his valuables. 

They also admitted that they had robbed one constable of the Delhi Police at Cantt area while he was returning home from his duty, the DCP said. 

They said they used to ply in a car and pretend like passengers. They also used to offer lift to passerby. After getting the victim in their car, they used to forcefully beat and rob them at gunpoint. After robbing the passenger, they used to throw the victim at a lonely place and move away from the spot, Alphonse said. 

One of them used to sit in the van in the uniform of the Delhi Police so that they would not be stopped by police in achieving their target, he said. 

Police are looking to nab their associate Parful (21), they said, adding four mobile phones, one motorcycle, two cars, one pistol with two live cartridges were recovered from them.

St Stephen’s brings back entry test, hikes fees 

","
NEW DELHI: The governing body of St Stephen’s College has decided to hold an aptitude test for all its 10 undergraduate courses this year. The college has also announced an increase in the merit differential percentage to 25% for those aspirants who come under Church of North India (CNI) and Church of North India-Delhi (CNI-D). It has also been decided to increase the fees by 6-7%.

The decisions were taken in the governing body meeting held on March 14. The staff association, however, has called a meeting on April 3 to discuss the issue and refer the matter to the staff council stating that the decisions were taken without consulting them.

The prospectus for admission will be available from April 22. Being a religious minority institution, the college conducts its own admission process.

In 2015, former Stephen’s principal Valson Thampu had introduced the aptitude test along with an interview for admission. In all, 15 marks were divided between the aptitude test and interview, while the rest was dependent on Class XII marks. However, last year the aptitude test for two BSc (honours) courses — Physics and Chemistry — was not held.

“The decisions were taken without consulting the teachers. The governing body is bypassing the department and taking decisions. This was the reason the aptitude tests were dropped last year,” said a teacher representative in the GB.

Despite repeated attempts, the college principal, John Varghese, didn’t respond to queries by TOI.

The teachers have also objected to the merit differential relaxation between the general category and those who come under CNI and CNI-D stating that 25% is a “large” number and disadvantageous for others. While 50% of the college seats are reserved for Christians, 22.5% of the remaining half is reserved for CNI. Of this, 11.25% is earmarked for applicants from the Delhi diocese which manages the college.

“The increase in fees is not justifiable. There are other trust-run colleges like ours, but they do not increase the fees as the funding is the same,” said the teacher.

‘New parking policy must for Delhi, will frame norms’ 

","
NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday said the parking problem in Delhi needed to be addressed urgently in view of growing number of vehicles and it would pass an order and frame guidelines which would not only solve the problem but also deal with the future requirement.

“Parking is an important issue and something has to be done to resolve the problem,” a bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Deepak Gupta said. It directed the Centre, Delhi government, DDA, municipal bodies and city police to file their suggestions. The court said it would pass a comprehensive order after hearing all the parties and posted the case to April 5.

The Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority filed its report after holding consultations with all parties and suggested charging people for parking their cars in residential colonies and said the policy was being followed successfully by Resident Welfare Associations in several localities.

The authority told the court that an additional 660 hectares would be required annually to park newly registered vehicles in Delhi and suggested that multi-level parking should be constructed across the city. 

“The annual additional demand for land to park cars is already massive in Delhi. Taking 2016-17 figures for car registration in Delhi (roughly 1.66 lakh new cars were registered) as a benchmark, Delhi annually needs an additional 382 hectares of area under car parking every year. For a sense of scale, this is roughly equivalent to 2.8 times the size of entire IIT Delhi campus. If two-wheelers are added, an additional 277 hectares is required every year as six lakh two-wheelers were registration in 2016-17,” the report said.

The EPCA said a survey found that night-time parking was a serious issue, which led to obstruction on roads and problems with movement of emergency vehicles, including ambulances. “This creates serious risk for all residents and undermines their right to access essential services to ensure safety and well being. This requires immediate attention and management of on-street parking on public roads in residential areas,” it said.

The SC had earlier rejected the proposal to charge people for parking their cars outside their houses and said such a policy was not feasible.

However, the EPCA supported levying parking charge in residential areas and said, “The pricing for residential parking should be determined jointly by the local agency and RWA/shopkeepers’ association but it must be based on the principle of charging differential and higher rates for additional cars.”

Delhi man kills wife in rage, cover story unravels in 4 days 

","
NEW DELHI: Four days after a woman was found murdered in her house in Swaroop Nagar, her husband has been arrested for the crime. The man, Vikas Sharma, runs a transport business. His mobile phone location led cops to the conclusion that he had committed the murder.


The woman, Savita, was found with a stab injury on the nape of her neck. When she was killed, her 10-year-old daughter was sleeping in the house.

The couple had been married for 12 years. While Sharma ran an autorickshaw, his wife operated a beauty parlour. She was also involved in an informal business of lending and borrowing money with other women of the area.

On interrogation, Sharma told police that he used to have frequent arguments with Savita and was planning to separate from her. On Monday night, the couple had a fight after a few of Savita’s lenders came to their house demanding repayment of the money she had borrowed.

The man wanted his wife to stop her business, which led to a heated argument between them. Sharma then stabbed her in the nape of her neck with a sharp object. As she fell to the floor unconscious, Sharma decided to spin a cover story to save himself.

In the morning, Sharma called up Savita’s employee at the beauty parlour. He told her that he had left his house early in the morning. Since then he had been trying his wife’s phone, but she was not responding. He asked the girl to go to the house and check on her following which the murder came to the fore.

Sharma returned home and acted as if he had gone into shock. The woman’s body was sent for autopsy. Police got suspicious when the time of the injury didn’t match with the narrative given by Sharma. The cops checked his location based on his mobile phone activity and even that contradicted his statement. He confessed to the crime during questioning. The weapon used in the crime has been recovered.

For Pak Hindus, home is where the mind is without fear 

","
New Delhi: Almost every family living in the two refugee colonies in the capital for Hindus from Pakistan has a story to tell on what impelled them to leave their homes and flee to India. 

Dharmu ‘Master’, a tailor in his early-40s, came to India in 2017. His wife and three children took the only train — Thar Express — from his village in Sindh and got down at Jodhpur in Rajasthan before coming to Delhi. “We got a visa to visit Haridwar. But while leaving our house in Pakistan, we knew we would not return again,” says Dharmu. “I had an established business there but we had to leave because we were being targeted by our neighbours.”

Trouble started in 2016 when Dharmu opened a new shop and inscribed religious symbols on the billboard. He was asked to remove the symbols. When he did not oblige, he was threatened and his shop vandalised. Although Dharmu has had to give up his profession and does not have a steady income, he says he has found his “lost confidence and self-respect” in India. 

His three children go to school and his eldest daughter, Meena, recently passed her Class VI exams at a government school, something which was not possible in the neighbouring country, he says.

Dharmu’s story was echoed by other colony dwellers. They say they lived in fear in Pakistan, faced threats, victimisation and financial exclusion. When the first set of families settled in Delhi, word spread that “India was welcoming its people” and more started trickling in.

And yet every family has relatives left behind in Pakistan — a brother, son, daughter — and they fear for their safety, especially after India’s strikes against terrorist camps in Balakot, Pakistan.

Ashutosh Joshi, an activist who runs crowdfunding campaigns to sponsor the colony’s every day expenses on medicines, diesel generator and house repairs, is also active in social media groups where people from Sindh share their “woes”. Citing the example of two Hindu girls, Raveena, 13, and Reena, 15, who were allegedly kidnapped by a group of “influential” men from their home in Ghotki in Sindh on the eve of Holi, Joshi claims that at least seven Hindu minor girls have been kidnapped in the past 35 days as “revenge” against the Balakot strike.

Joshi, a senior finance manager at a Noida-based multinational corporation, got involved in the colony’s activities two years ago and started a crowdfunding campaign on online platform, Milaap, raising Rs 15 lakh for the refugees’ rehabilitation. A portion went into sponsoring nine weddings in January. 

“Most brides and grooms were from within the community, but some were refugees from another colony in Majnu ka Tila,” says Joshi, who started another online campaign on Milaap recently.

The refugee colony in Majnu ka Tila, a few kilometres away, was set up in 2011. Today, there are over 500 people from seven districts of Sindh living here. There are seven pradhans (chiefs) who oversee the colony’s everyday affairs. Dharamveer, one of the pradhans, came to India in 2014. He says he migrated because he couldn’t practise his religion in Pakistan. “Our children could not study. Even when they did, the education was theocratic,” he says.

The struggle here is about an electricity connection. There was some respite in 2015, when the Arvind Kejriwal government facilitated regular water supply to the colony and a 24-hour generator. The power line was, however, discontinued in 2017, plunging the colony back in darkness. Since then, the pradhans have written regularly to authorities to reinstall their power supply but they have not got any reply.

“The Yamuna is just a few metres from our dwellings. Snakes are found here regularly and without light, it is difficult to protect ourselves in the darkness,” says Dharamveer. 

But, he does not regret moving to India. “Here, our problems are limited to food and water. In Pakistan, we had to be on constant vigil to ensure the safety of our women,” he says. “All of us know someone who has been forcibly converted. At most times, they don’t ask us to convert but constantly preach their own religion.” 

He adds that he came to Delhi on a visitor’s visa after telling officials in Pakistan that he was travelling for the Kumbh Mela in Uttar Pradesh.

Despite all difficulties, the decision to leave their ancestral homes wasn’t easy. As 60-year-old Meghi, who left Pakistan’s Hyderabad district four years ago, says, “Nobody wants to leave their homes willingly. We were forced to leave Pakistan because we had no option. If someone assures us of safety, we will go back. But for now, India is our country.”

Delhi traffic cop held for thrashing trucker 

","
NEW DELHI: A traffic police constable who owns a godown in outer Delhi has been arrested after a video of him thrashing a truck driver and then throttling him went viral on social media. The video showed the cop in a room with the driver. He accused the driver of allegedly paying a weighbridge owner to pass off an underweight container truck that was heading to the cop’s godown as one of requisite weight. The incident was reported later at Mundka police station based on which the man was arrested.

In the video, the policeman, Kapil, claimed to have caught the truck driver, Deepak, while trying to cheat him by delivering less goods and charging him for the full container. He had locked up Deepak in a room and recorded the video on his mobile phone.

It showed Kapil standing with a stick while Deepak was whining on the bed. He hit Deepak several times with the stick due to which the stick snapped. After this, he sat on Deepak’s chest and throttled him.

Later, Kapil forced Deepak to confess on camera that he had cheated him with a bribe of Rs 100 to the weighbridge owner. Soon after, the video went dark and Deepak was heard crying out in pain while being tortured by Kapil.

DCP (outer) Seju Kuruvilla said that a case was registered based on the complaint by the truck owner after which Kapil was arrested. “We have booked him and have asked the traffic department to conduct an inquiry,” he said. Deepak was admitted to a hospital. Cops are probing whether the cop was using his influence to allow overweight trucks to enter the city to send goods to his godown.

Most ‘shot-after’ criminal cheats death thrice 

","
NEW DELHI: This gangster is supposedly invulnerable as even after several attempts on his life, he has managed to get back on his feet. He was shot five times in 2012 and remained in the ICU for a month. In mid-2018, he was shot four times with 9mm and .315-bore bullets, but survived. Last December, his rivals fired around 30 rounds at his house in which he sustained two gunshot injuries, but he managed to hoodwink death again.




Meet Dushyant alias Monu Bajitpur, a gym trainer by profession, who has been in the gun sight of his rivals for six years. The wanted man with a reward of Rs 1 lakh on his head was arrested by a Special Cell team led by ACPs Lalit Mohan Negi and Hriday Bhushan for the murder of a cab driver, who was working as a shooter for Bajitpur’s rivals, in January this year.

DCP (Special Cell) Pramod Kushwaha said Bajitpur (35) is a close associate of jailed gangster Neeraj Bawania. He is a native of Bajitpur Thakran village in outer Delhi. In 2010, he got into a quarrel with a fellow villager, Manoj, and thrashed him brutally. He was arrested and sent to jail where he met Bawania and his Man Friday Kala Asodiya.

The Bawania gang had rivalry with slain gangster Neetu Dabodia and Ashok Pradhan. After Dabodia was killed in an encounter with police, his gang was taken over by Ashok Pardhan and Rajesh Bawania.

The gang rivalry led to multiple attempts on Bajitpur’s life. In the first attempt, Neetu Dabodia himself shot at him, but he survived even after receiving five bullet injuries. After recovery, Bajitpur committed many heinous crimes, including murder, attempt to murder, robbery, extortion and attack on police. He was again attacked on May 25 and December 25 in 2018 by shooters led by one Hitesh Happy hired by Pradhan.

The attack in May occurred at his gym. The December attack was captured on CCTV. The footage showed Bajitpur riding a white scooter being followed by a Maruti Swift car. The Swift hit him and threw him on the ground. The men got out and showered bullets on him. He managed to enter a house and shut the door. Later, he was taken to a hospital and admitted in the ICU.

In retaliation, Bajitpur got a suspected informer of his rivals, Vikas Chauhan, gunned down near a school in Narela in January.

“Bajitpur used to make extortion calls to builders, businessmen and bookies. He was planning to kill rival shooters, identified as Hitesh, Sanam, and Rahul, and had been arranging logistics for the crime,” Kushwaha added.

His arrest came after a team comprising inspectors Sanjay Gupta and Rajesh got a tip-off that he would be coming to Rohini Sector 16. A loaded .32-bore pistol was seized form him. 

Police will ask the jail authorities to provide security to Bajitpur given the threat to his life.

Delhi: Ex-Armyman, 93, duped in name of government scheme 

","
NEW DELHI: As an Armyman, Madan Mohan Lal was ready for any battle. Now, at 93, he is fighting to get about Rs 10 lakh of his money back from crooks who duped him at the pretext of a government scheme for senior citizens.


A resident of Shahdara in east Delhi, the senior citizen’s ordeal began last year when he started getting calls on his landline number from people who claimed to be RBI and IRDA representatives. “They told me that government has released large amounts of money for very senior citizens for their welfare. They said I have to become a member to avail of these schemes,” Lal said in a complaint to the police. All the calls came from Mumbai.

Convinced, Lal agreed to the terms and conditions: he was told to make some payments, which he would get back with a bonus after a stipulated time. As per the complainant, he received a call in August last year from a man who introduced himself as HoD of the NOC cell of the Governing Body of Insurance Council (GBIC). Lal was told that his file had been received, but he needed to pay Rs 6.5 lakh to get the NOC.

“Later, I started getting warning calls that if I didn’t pay the amount, my file will be blocked and I won’t get back any money,” the complaint stated. Lal wrote to the GBIC president. A few days later, he was informed that the callers were fraudsters and that he should inform the police. 

Lal approached the police and gave them details of the amount he had sent to the crooks. The cops, after checking with banks about the transactions, registered a case under sections of cheating against unknown persons at the Shahdara police station. Sources said the man lost more than Rs 10 lakh to the fraudsters.

Sleuths are now trying to track the phone numbers used by the cheats, along with the bank accounts where the money was transferred.

Mayank Gandhi: Delhi will win all the food competitions

TV actor Mayank Gandhi believes that if there is a competition between Delhi’s chhole bhature, Mumbai’s vada pav and Hyderabad’s biryani, then Delhi would emerge as the winner. “We score 100 on 100 when it comes to food. No other state can beat us. Only Punjab comes a close second,” he asserts. However, Mayank admits that while he loves Delhi’s chatpata khana, he can’t eat his favourite food because he is on a strict diet. “These days my diet includes grilled chicken and loads of boiled vegetables, which is sad. But kya kar sakte hain,” says the 'Splitsvilla 7' winner.
Mayank, who used to live in Rohini and then in Greater Kailash before moving to Gurgaon, tells us that he has noticed that every place in NCR has its own food preference. “While you get amazing roadside food in the north-west side of Delhi (Rohini), GK is more of a posh area with some really good high-end restaurants and cafes. Gurgaon also has an emerging pub culture but there are many places that offer authentic Haryanvi food,” he says.

SJM director post: Knowledge of chemistry can’t be wished away 

","
Hyderabad: Stating that there is nothing wrong in adding a degree in chemistry as an additional qualification to become eligible to compete for the post of director of a museum, the Telangana high court on Friday dismissed a petition filed by J Kedareswari of Salar Jung Museum who was aspiring to become a director of the museum. The bench of Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice T Amarnath Goud pronounced the verdict after hearing the petitioner and Salar Jung Museum Board. 

The petitioner was working at the museum as a keeper and has been fighting a legal battle for the last 10 years to become the director of the museum. The matter went to the Supreme Court which declared her ineligible to hold the post as she did not possess the qualifications in tune with the amended rules that brought in chemistry qualification as a prerequisite. She challenged the change in rules and sought the filling of the post in tune with the old rules because she has been fighting the case before the emergence of new rules.

However, the bench did not agree to this. ""Museums are no longer a curio shop. Painting and scriptures require chemical restorations. If the new rules make a person with a degree in chemistry eligible, it is not unreasonable”, it said. The bench also did not approve of the allegations raised by the petitioner that joint director A N Reddy of the museum was blocking her growth.

A farmer climbs mobile tower, other on FB live to attract CM’s attention 

","
Hyderabad: A day after chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao responded to a facebook live video of a farmer settling his land issue in Mancherial on Wednesday, another desperate farmer on Thursday attracted the attention of chief minister to his problems in Kangdi mandal of Sangareddy district.

The farmer in question, whose name also is Sangareddy, climbed a cell phone tower and threatened to jump if his issues were not resolved. 

However, the local police and revenue officials convinced him to come down, assuring that his complaint would be looked into. Sangareddy said his family owned four acres and four guntas of land in Degulwadi village and his father Shekhar Reddy had recently sold one acre of land to a person by name Kashiram.

But while they had sold only one acre, their entire land was transferred in the name of the person, who they had sold it to. He said two officials had asked them not to raise the issue and said the family would be given Rs 3 lakh. But Sangareddy refused to take it and wanted their land restored. 

“The two officials threatened to kill me or my father, if we went to the police with a complaint,” he said.

On the other hand, the farmer from Mancherial, went live on Facebook again, thanking chief minister Chandasekhar Rao for responding to his plea and helping him get back his land. The seven acre land had been on his father Shankaraiah’s name, but local revenue officials transferred it on to the name of another person. KCR called the farmer Sharath and told him that he had asked collector Bharati Hollikeri to visit his village and solve the matter. While the collector said it had been rectified, another issue cropped up pertaining to the land.

A woman who claimed to be a relative of Sharath put out an audio in which she said KCR had not heard, her side of the story. Identifying herself as Jyothi, she said she was the daughter of Shankaraiah’s brother and said there was a dispute over the ownership of the land. An official in Mancherial collectorate told TOI that the woman had come to the collectorate. She had sought to meet the collector to explain the issue.

Hc upholds transfer of 3 Andhra IPS officers: High court upholds transfer of 3 Andhra IPS officers by Election Commission of India 

","
VIJAYAWADA: The Andhra Pradesh high court on Friday refused to stay the Election Commission of India's (ECI) decision to transfer three IPS officers, including director general (intelligence) A B Venkateswara Rao. Following the orders from the high court, the state government transferred A B Venkateswara Rao and asked him to report at the police headquarters. 


The government also directed the DGP not to allot any poll-related duties to Venkateswara Rao till the elections are completed.

Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu had accused the ECI of acting under the pressure of PM Narendra Modi and effecting the transfer of IPS officers. He said though DG (intelligence) was not involved in poll duty, the central poll body ordered his transfer. The government also sent a list with the names of Nalini Prabhat, Kumar Viswajit and Kripanand Tripati Ujela to the ECI for a new director general (intelligence).

On Tuesday night, the EC issued orders transferring A B Venkateswara Rao, Kadapa SP Rahul Dev Sharma and Srikakulam SP A Venkata Ratnam. The state government issued a GO complying with the EC order and transferred three officers on Tuesday but later cancelled the transfer of Venkateswara Rao.

Setback for Anrak as HC allows SBI to go ahead with insolvency process 

","
HYDERABAD: In a major setback to Anrak Aluminium company, the Telangana high court on Thursday allowed an appeal filed by RBI and allowed SBI authorities to drag the company to the insolvency process at National Company Law Tribunal, Hyderabad. A bench of Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice T Amarnath Goud pronounced this order after hearing a writ appeal filed by RBI challening the order of a single judge who found fault with an RBI circular and also with SBI for initiating insolvency process even after agreeing to settle for the company’s one-time settlement offer of Rs 1,275 crore. The company took loans from a consortium of banks headed by SBI and the total dues stand at a staggering Rs 3,000 crore.


Anrak company, a joint venture firm floated by Penna industrial group and Ras Al Khaima of the United Arab Emirates, was supposed to set up an aluminium plant in Vizag Agency area with the help of raw bauxite supplied from AP Mineral Development Corporation. Following resistance from tribals, then AP government cancelled the agreement to supply bauxite to Anrak. 

The single judge found fault with SBI mainly on this ground that when the state government had failed to fulfil its commitment, it may not be fair to blame the company. RBI counsel S Niranjan Reddy, however, said that mere reference to NCLT would not harm the company and the tribunal-appointed resolution professional could suggest a resolution plan that may include restructuring of the company. 

Appearing for Anrak, senior counsel Raghunandan Rao told the bench that nothing would remain in their hands if the NCLT admits the plea and commences the insolvency resolution process and the bank may not get even the amount that was assured by them. “We agreed for a settlement of Rs 1,275 crore and have already paid Rs 400 crore. We would pay the remaining amount by the end of March,” he said. The bench did not agree with the company’s arguments.

The bench, however, suspended its judgement for a period of one month to enable the company to avail itself of legal remedies.

Raid finds kennel illegally operating as boarding centre 

","
HYDERABAD: Following a complaint about the suspicious death of a pet dog at a kennel in Boduppal, animal rights activists, on Thursday, raided the facility and found it was illegally operating as a boarding and breeding centre. Activists found 15 dogs at the kennel, all of them either unhealthy, malnourished or injured.


The incident came to light on Wednesday night, after the owner of the pet, M Sai Kumar, called the Compassionate Society for Animals’ (CSA) helpline to report that his Labrador kept at the kennel died under suspicious circumstances.

“My dog was very healthy when I dropped him at that place, before leaving the city for a few days. Later, when the kennel owner sent me a few pictures and a video, he appeared to be in the last stages of his ill health and was struggling to move and breathe,” said Sai Kumar adding, “I would have done something to save my dog from dying if the kennel owner had informed me when he fell sick. He did not even handover the body when I went there.”

Following Sai Kumar’s call, N Pravalika, founder and chairperson of CSA filed a complaint with the Medipally police station. The kennel owner was subsequently taken into custody and a case was registered under Section 429 (killing or maiming an animal) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and 11(1) (a)—treating animals cruelly—of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.

“The kennel owner is now in our custody. On questioning him, he said that the dogs in his kennel belonged to a few pet owners who had left them at his kennel for a few days. Two of t he dogs, he said, belonged to People for Animals,” said Raghu Ramudu, sub-inspector, Medipally police station.

Speaking about the raid, Pravalika said that it was conducted after the police detained the owner. “When we got there we saw that the dogs were chained inside cramped cages infested with ticks,” she said and added, “While the pet owner who alerted us about the kennel also told us about three other dogs being in a critical condition, those dogs were missing when we went. We found only 15 dogs on Thursday.”

Activists are now awaiting a medical certificate from veterinary officials to rescue these animals.

BJP’s Muralidhar Rao, 8 others booked for cheating 

","
HYDERABAD: A criminal case was filed on Tuesday against BJP national general secretary P Muralidhar Rao and eight others for allegedly collecting Rs 2.17 crore from a city-based realtor by promising him a nominated post in the central government. The victim also alleged he was lured by showing a purported letter with forged signature of Union minister Nirmala Sitharaman.


Muralidhar Rao, however, refuted the allegations and said he had nothing to do with the case.

Based on a court-referred complaint from T Pravarna Reddy (41), wife of realtor Mahipal Reddy from Champapet in Hyderabad, Saroornagar police on Tuesday registered a case under Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating), 468, 471 (forgery), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and Section 156 (3) of the CrPC against Muralidhar Rao and eight others.

In Nov 2015, the complainant alleged, Eswar Reddy, a journalist, claiming to be closely associated with prominent BJP leaders, approached them saying he knew A Krishna Kishore, ‘the shadow’ of BJP leader Muralidhar Rao.

“Eswar Reddy claimed Krishna Kishore was capable of getting a nominated post in any department of the central government. My husband and I were reluctant to get the nominated post by spending a huge amount,” the complainant said.

'
We were pressured to accept proposal'

Later, Eswar again approached us along with Krishna Kishore and local BJP leader Manda Rama Chandra Reddy and pressured us to accept the proposal by saying that they would be able to get nominated membership of Pharma Exil, which functions under Union ministry of commerce & industries,” the complainant alleged. “Subsequently, the trio along with Rama Chandra Reddy’s close associates S Chandrashekar Reddy, Baba, Srikanth, G Srinivas and with active connivance of Muralidhar Rao, showed a photocopy of the letter purportedly signed by Nirmala Sitaraman, saying that my husband will be appointed chairperson of Pharma Exil and took Rs 2.17 crore from us,” the complainant alleged.

Muralidhar Rao said, “The complainant contacted me three years ago over phone about the same issue and I asked her to lodge a complaint with police. She did not do so. I knew some of the accused as part of my work. But I have got nothing to with the case or money.”

Saroornagar police inspector E Srinivas Reddy said a case was registered based on the court’s directions and investigations were on.

Sea fever grips Hyderabadis, many board luxury cruiseliners: Most bookings in India come from city 

","
Holidaymakers from the city have caught on to the trend of going on cruises. Whether it is to celebrate one’s wedding anniversary, birthday or a festival, people from the city are travelling across the globe on cruise liners.


According to sources from the Cruise Line International Association (CLIA), people from the city are among a rising number of Indians going on voyages every year.

International cruise line operators say that over the last two years city residents have been going on cruises in Europe, Mediterranean, Caribbean, Alaska, Galapagos and Singapore.




The number of international travelers heading on cruises from here have gone up by 37% in 2018 as compared to 2017, according to the CLIA sources. Around 22% of cruisers from the city go on family tours, while the rest go on mostly corporate and business tours.

Confirming the spurt in booking for cruise tours from the city, local travels agents said the demand is more for luxury ships which have snazzy restaurants and lodging facilities.

“Higher value bookings for luxury ships come to us more from Hyderabad rather than other cities in the country,” Varun Chadda of Tirun Travel Marketing, representative of Royal Caribbean International Cruises in India, told TOI.

Local travel agents design tours that cost from $180 to $2,500 a person. Fares can go higher in peak seasons depending on the facilities asked for.

Surprisingly, even though Visakhapatnam is closer to the city, people embark on international cruises from Mumbai, Kochi, Dubai and Singapore.

“Talks are going on to boost the infrastructure at Vizag port which is known for operating cruises to Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Dhananjay Joshi, assistant director of Andhra Pradesh Tourism Authority has already written to us in this regard,” said Chadda.

The Congress reacted swiftly and suspended Sunitha Laxma Reddy from the party, hours after she met CM KCR on Tuesday. The grand old party also suspended ex-MLA and Nalgonda-Bhuvanagiri DCC ex-president Bikshmaiah Goud and TPCC general secretary Palle Laxman Kumar Goud. Both joined the ruling TRS. Bikshmaiah announced that he was quitting the party to protest against the Komatireddy brothers’ high-handed attitude and lack of leadership qualities.

Even BJP had tried to woo Sunitha into the saffron party camp but she refused to join.

She had denied that she was going to join BJP and stated that she would stay put in Congress.

Sunitha had been upset with the Congress leadership for ignoring her despite repeated pleas to give her the Medak Lok Sabha seat.

The Congress gave it to G Anil Kumar. She had been staying away from party programmes for the past few days. She met TRS working president KT Rama Rao on Tuesday and told her decision to join the TRS.

Sunitha was elected as Congress MLA from Narsapur Assembly Constituency in Medak.

She was elected for three terms from the same constituency.

She served as minister in the cabinets of K Rosaiah and N Kiran Kumar Reddy.

When netas give street food a political tadka 

","
Hyderabad: Prime Minister Narendra Modi may well be the most well-known ‘chaiwala’ of the nation, but there are other lesser-known chaiwalas in the two Telugu states trying to strike a chord with the electorate. They are those who are stirring a gastronomic delight in the cauldron of ‘khichdi politics’. 

As the election date draws closer, candidates are trying every trick in their political bag — from lavish spending to vote-buying and to literally falling at voters’ feet — to ensure poll success. Some brewed cups of India’s favourite ‘adrak chai’, others did deep-fried crunchy ‘pakoda politics’, while some others tried their hand at crispy masala dosa or spicy ‘mirchi bhajji politics.

Dosa: Batter of success?

With assets worth Rs 75 crore, Vasundhara Devi probably must have never tried her hand at making a dosa or iron clothes in her life. The wife of actor and sitting TDP MLA, Nandamuri Balakrishna, while campaigning for her husband in Hindupur constituency was seen ironing clothes at a laundry shop in the constituency, and even making dosas at a street corner. Devi then requested everyone to vote for her husband Balakrishna. The husband-wife duo even headed to a local Anjaneya Swamy temple to seek the blessings of Lord Hanuman for a possible victory in the elections. Balakrishna is worth over Rs 100 crore, both movable and immovable assets put together.

The garland weaver

Tirupati is the abode of Lord Venkateswara, known as alankarapriya — the one who loves jewellery and garlands. Fragrant flowers play a major role in daily rituals and decoration of Lord Venkateswara, an eye-feast for lakhs of his ‘bhakts’. Devotees’ love for the Lord is mainly expressed in offering garlands, a major source of livelihood for locals, many of whom are voters. If it’s ‘the art of making garlands’, one must learn from former MP and senior Congress leader, Chinta Mohan, who is trying his luck from the Tirupati Lok Sabha seat. During his campaign, the seasoned politician was seen with vendors, intricately weaving pearly-white jasmine buds with tulsi leaves to string a mala. Will the ‘flower power’ bloom for this six-time MP and former Union minister is something that remains to be seen, but for now he will be facing formidable rivals like Panabaka Lakshmi (TDP) and Balli Durgaprasada Rao (YSRCP).

Andhra Chaiwala

Modi’s ‘chaiwala’ image spawned national ‘charchas’, almost becoming a symbolism of national politics. Chai with an extra adrak is often brewed with hot politics at tea stalls across India, and Pyakaraopeta in Visakhapatnam perhaps is no exception. Probably inspired by Modi’s tea-boy background, Bangaraiah, a doctor with the King George Hospital, is frequenting tea stalls not just to seek votes but to make a hot cuppa over politics. The doctor, contesting on TDP ticket in Pyakaraopeta MLA constituency, saw tea stall as the best beginning to become part of that symbolism. Remains to be seen if he can doctor a victory in the elections over chai politics.

Puri politics

Main toh raste se ja raha tha, main toh bhel puri kha raha tha, is how Govinda expressed his love for Karisma Kapoor and bhel puri in Coolie No. 1. In Anakapalle, people don’t relish bhel puri as much as pesarattu and puri with potato curry. Jana Sena MLA candidate for Anakapalle constituency, Paruchuri Bhaskar Rao, thought that if Balakrishna’s wife can make dosas, he can fry a crispy puri over politics. On campaign trail, Bhaskar Rao, a cousin of Ganta Srinivasa Rao, the HRD minister of Andhra Pradesh, tweaked the Coolie No 1 song to Main toh raste se ja raha tha, main toh puri bana raha tha.

Barber politics

In the 2018 Assembly elections, Muthireddy Yadagiri Reddy of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) set a new benchmark in political canvassing. He showed off his impressive shaving skills at a barber’s shop in his Jangaon constituency, well in a traditional wet shave style by applying rich lather on the beard of a customer. Muthireddy had clean shave when he earned over 91,000 votes — almost 30,000 more than his nearest rival Ponnala Lakshmaiah of Congress — in the Assembly elections.

Chandrababu Naidu and KTR engage in Twitter spat 

","
HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu and TRS working president K T Rama Rao engaged in a spat on Twitter on Wednesday with the TDP president making a statement that people from AP are beaten up in Telangana.


Naidu also shared a video of him campaigning for the TDP along with NCP leader and former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Farooq Abdullah. In his speech, he pointed out that TRS leader and Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had described the people of Andhra as ‘drohulu’ and that they were looters. “KCR said he would take back our houses and properties of AP origin people in Telangana. He also said if they set foot in Telangana, he would break their legs. He said we had come from Madras to settle in Telangana and would drive us away,” Naidu said.

Naidu said when Sonia Gandhi had said she would give special status to AP after bifurcation, KCR also demanded the same for Telangana with his litigations.

Naidu then questioned in the tweet whether it was proper for YSRCP leader Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy to join hands with TRS. “Jaganmohan Reddy asks what is wrong with joining hands with KCR. Is it right what he is doing?,” Naidu asked the crowd asking them to lift their hands to agree with him that Jangan was wrong.

Reacting to Naidu’s remarks, TRS working president K T Rama Rao said: “I wonder why you/TDP were desperately wanting to align with TRS in recently held Telangana elections Chandrababu Naidu garu?”

It may be mentioned in the December 2018 assembly polls, Naidu wanted to align with the TRS but KCR refused. Naidu himself said this during the election campaign at that time.

In a tweet, KTR also expressed displeasure at BJP workers passing nasty comments on Twitter. “I sincerely thank the BJP leadership for helping me identify to mute/block the trolls/bhakts by adding the prefix ‘chowkidar’. It’s okay to voice your opinion guys but getting downright ugly with nasty comments isn’t what democracy is about. Not cool at all,” he said.

Visa racket: Cop, travel agent held 

","
HYDERABAD: The Cyberabad police arrested two people including an immigration officer on Thursday within days of busting an international human trafficking racket.


A total of 18 persons, including two employees of different airlines and a constable, were taken into custody on March 20. This was after 70 people attempted to go to Kuwait with tampered visas.

Police nabbed Mohammed Manzoor Khan, 49, an immigration officer and head constable in Mahbubnagar district and Penigilapati Anjaneyulu Naidu, 52, a travel agent from Mumbai.

According to the police, Manzoor was in central deputation from Mahbubnagar police to the Bureau of immigration. The accused and his associate had taken huge sums of money to help foreign travellers get visas without proper documents for over two years.

Naidu on the other hand was running a Protector of Emigrants (POE) registered licensed travel agency, Sairam Travels, in Mumbai. According to the police, the accused would courier passports and entry visas to the Kuwaiti Embassy in Mumbai and get passports stamped without POE clearance. These passports would then be sent back to Hyderabad. Police have seized 10 Indian passports from their possession.

After the police busted the fake passport and visa racket, DCP Shamshabad held a meeting at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport with managers of all airlines that have international flights.

N Prakash Reddy, DCP, addressed the meeting and gave information about the recent arrests where two employees of different airlines were also nabbed.

Facing losses, farmers may give up on turmeric 

","
HYDERABAD: The turmeric farmers stood their ground on the last day of withdrawl of nominations as they get ready to cross swords with chief minister’s daughter K Kavitha in Nizamabad Lok Sabha constituency. They also made their point by drawing national attention but what could be their comeuppance is their move to shift to other crops as turmeric is draining their resources as what they call causing a lot of financial stress.


Interacting with TOI, Malla Reddy, a 40-year-old grower from Mupkal village in Balkonda mandal, said they did not waver despite being slapped with several cases and told to withdraw nominations. “We stuck to our guns. The idea to enter the poll fray and file nominations got its wings in our village first. Later, we passed a resolution involving various farmers’ groups,” he said. Malla Reddy has three acres of land where he cultivated turmeric. He incurred a loss of Rs 50,000 per acre. “I have a son who is doing a multimedia course in Hyderabad and another son who is in school. After the heavy loss, I am forced to take loans to pay their fees,” he said.

P Pravin, 35, from Balkonda says he will immediately shift to alternative crops as turmeric crop was not feasible. He cultivated turmeric in six acres and red jowar in three acres. “We got Rs 12,000 per quintal in 2008. Now, we do not get even Rs 5,000, whereas the cost of production has gone up by 30%. The labour cost has gone up from Rs 10,000 to Rs 25,000,” he rues.

Sama Swami Reddy ridicules the market price of Rs 4,500-Rs 5,000 per quintal of turmeric. “We get ?45 per kg while its cost in the open export is over ?200. The government should fix the MSP at Rs 10,000 a quintal if not Rs 15,000,” he argues.

Like Swami, several growers see hope in turmeric board which they believe will help them have direct access to export market. “There will be strict monitoring of cultivation and price,” a farmer said.

Telangana people prefer cereals, spend Rs 2,000 per month on food 

","
HYDERABAD: People of Telangana spend an average Rs 2,156 on food in a month with cereals being preferred over other food items at 19% followed by milk and milk products at 15%. Telangana’s spend is almost close to the monthly expenditure incurred by urban Indians on food at Rs 2,630. But, the finding on urban Indians’ food habits came about six years ago in a National Samples Survey report filed in 2013 which also put rural Indians’ monthly expenditure at a paltry Rs 1,430.






In the latest survey on food consumption in Telangana—a first-of-its-kind exercise—compiled by Professor Jayashankar at Telangana State Agricultural University, it has emerged that, at 95%, Telangana people are among the major consumers of non-vegetarian food in the country. Senior officials said the survey was a precursor to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s plan to implement crop colonies project, aimed at reducing vegetable imports and encouraging local farmers to go in for more horticulture crops.

Rice is the most consumed food (77%) among cereals, while 4.6 litres of milk is consumed per month. The monthly per capita consumption (MPCC) of pulses is 12.6 kg, which is almost equal in rural and urban areas.

Among vegetables, onion and tomato occupy major share with 1 kg MPCC. Potato is not far behind with an MPCC of 510 gram. “Among fruits, banana is favourite with an MPCC of five,” the report explained.

For the record, Telangana has a very high non-vegetarian eating population. The consumption of non-vegetarian items in the form of meat/fish/egg (MFE) is 1.38 kg per month. MFE is consumed more in rural areas. Chicken meat takes the cake in MFE consumption (550 gm) in both rural and urban areas.

State seeks service of ex-armymen for polls 

","
HYDERABAD: Former defence personnel and retired cops are being roped in for election duty in Telangana because of shortage of 131 companies of central paramilitary forces for conducting the Lok Sabha polls on April 11.


Telangana director general of police, M Mahendar Reddy, has reported to the chief electoral officer that for the 17 Lok Sabha constituencies in the state, 276 companies of central paramilitary forces (CPMF) are required, but so far, the ministry of home affairs has allotted only 145 companies.

During the 2018 Assembly polls, around 19,000 police personnel were sourced from Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu. Out of these, three are going for Parliament elections in Phase One on April 11, and two for Phase two polls. Therefore, it has become difficult to get forces from these states. So far, only Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh have committed a total of 8,000 personnel. Tamil Nadu also agreed to provide cops.

For this, the DGP has requested election authorities for utilisation of the services of ex-servicemen, special police officers and retired cops. Chief electoral officer Rajat Kumar told TOI: “The number of critical polling stations, which were 10,280 during Assembly polls, have come down to 6,445. Though the decrease in critical polling stations is an advantage, we still need security personnel. We have sought permission from EC to deploy ex-servicemen.”

As the number of ex-servicemen in the state is not much, authorities have got in touch with Tamil Nadu for getting 8,000 to 10,000 former security personnel for the polls.

Pushed over the edge, teacher aspirants seek euthanasia 

","
Hyderabad: G Dattadri, 34, had dedicated four years of his life to fulfilling his dream of becoming a teacher and eventually cracked the Teachers Recruitment Test (TRT) in 2017.

Yet, he has been forced to remain unemployed for more than a year now as the Telangana government has failed to give him a posting, forcing him to request for euthanasia.

“I don’t even have money to consume Rs 5 meal supplied by the municipal corporation three times a day, I am surviving on just one meal,” said Dattadri, who holds two post-graduation degrees.

He said that the TRT qualified candidates are not in a position to opt for private jobs as the government is not giving them a proper timeframe.

“Every time we approach them, they say that counselling will be conducted in the next 10 days,” he said, adding that the government should atleast announce that they won’t be giving us postings for the next six months or a year so that we can work in private organisations.

Like Dattadri, there are 8,792 candidates who were shortlisted for the TRT exam and awaiting postings. They said that it is becoming harder to survive without proper income and claimed that their standard of living has drastically declined after they were selected for a government job. They approached the State Human Rights Commission and requested them to either direct the state to resolve the issue immediately or grant permission for mercy killing.

“At least 90% of the candidates selected are currently not working and are waiting for the state to conduct counselling. Our sufferings are never-ending and it has reached a stage where we can’t bear them anymore,” said RK Reddy, one of the candidates, who approached the commission on Thursday.

He said that even private organisations are not ready to employ them as they are aware that the candidates have been selected for government jobs and would resign as and when they get orders.

The teachers said that those selected as school assistants would get atleast Rs 50,000 per month, but said that they have been forced to wait for years to get the job they have been selected for.

It may be recalled that thousands of candidates selected for Group-II had also approached the HRC last week and requested for euthanasia. A total of 3,147 candidates have been waiting for years for postings as the state has been delaying the completion of the recruitment process.

Hyderabad: Bookings mount, more tanker trips planned 

","
HYDERABAD: The demand for tankers across the city is on the rise with summer having set in. The WATER BOARD has been supplying 460 million gallons of Godavari and Krishna water from the twin reservoirs of Osmansagar and Himayathsagar to meet the demand this summer.


In spite of the water board’s efforts, the booking of tankers has sky-rocketed in three major GHMC peripheral areas. For instance, 732 bookings or requisitions for the supply oftankers are pending at Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Division-XV which covers Chandanagar, Madhapur, Gachibowli and adjoining areas. If a consumer books a tanker from any of these areas, water board is able to deliver the tanker only within four or five days.

Though there is a tanker problem in Hyderabad and Secunderabad too, the water board is for now making do with the supplies of Godavari and Krishna. In the city, a consumer can get a tanker within 48 hours from the date of booking.

“Water board has opened additional filling stations,” HMWS&SB director-revenue, B Vijay Kumar Reddy told TOI. As on date, there are 127 bookings at O&M Division-III and another 27 bookings at O&M Division-IX. Based on the demand, water board is gearing up to ply additional tankers and will increase trips, he said.

Hooked to mobiles, 79% Hyderabadis are insomniacs 

","
HYDERABAD: People in the city are sleeping less and their sleep has gotten more disturbed, according to a survey. With unhealthy lifestyle habits and stress becoming a major factor for most Hyderabadis, 79% of respondents admitted to suffering from insomnia. 





The survey was conducted by Wakefit.co, a sleep solutions company. The year-long ‘Great Indian Sleep Scorecard 2019’ surveyed residents from Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad. About 16,000 respondents took part in the survey conducted to mark World Sleep Day that was on March 15. The survey suggests that 48% of people in the city prefer sleeping between 11pm and 1 am. It further revealed that 25% people sleep less than seven hours and 89% wake up one to two times a night. 

The reason for many people staying up late is the fact that they are hooked to their electronic devices either watching shows or because they can’t sleep as they are bogged down by the future. The survey says that 90% of respondents in the city use their phones before hitting the bed and 81% feel sleepy at work between one to three days a week. Not just being tired, but problems such as back pains also keep people up, with 45% of respondents complaining of this issue. 

Speaking about the issue, Ankit Garg, co-founder & CEO, Wakefit.co, said, “Lack of sleep can lead to a multitude of health issues that range from high blood pressure to increased anxiety...What’s concerning is that a majority of people don’t consider sleeping disorders as a real problem.”

Hyderabad: An illegal dog boarding and breeding kennel at Boduppal was shut down and the owner arrested by Medipally police on Friday.

TOI had reported in these columns about surprise raids at the kennel on Thursday and how it was illegally operating as a boarding centre after the suspicious death of a pet dog at the facility. The Medipally police rescued several dogs from the kennel. 

“An FIR has been registered and the kennel owner has been arrested and sent for remand. We have also sent a team along with the activists to rescue the remaining dogs at the kennel,” Medipally sub-inspector Raghu Ramudu told TOI.

TOI reported how a healthy pet dog at the kennel died within a week under suspicious circumstances. It also reported about 15 other dogs, all of whom were either unhealthy, malnourished or injured. The photo evidence collected by the activists also revealed that the dogs were chained inside cramped cages and were infested with ticks. However, when the animal rights activists visited the kennel to rescue the dogs on Friday morning along with the police, only two dogs which belonged to People for Animals (PFA) were present and all the other dogs were missing.

“We could rescue only two dogs after we raided the facility. All the other dogs are missing. We also went to the breeder’s house to check if the dogs were shifted there but we could not find anything. We are still looking for the missing dogs and are hoping that they are safe,” said N Pravalika, founder and chairperson of Compassionate Society for Animals (CSA).

Farmer climbs mobile tower, seeks CM Chandrasekhar Rao’s help over land issue 

","
HYDERABAD: A day after chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao responded to a Facebook live video by a farmer named Sharath and settled his land issue in Mancherial district, another farmer named Sangareddy from Kangdi mandal of Sangareddy district climbed a mobile phone tower on Thursday and threatened to jump if issues related to his land were not resolved. However, the police and revenue officials coaxed him to climb down and assured that his complaint would be looked into.


Sangareddy said his family owned four acre and four guntas of land in Degulwadi village and his father Shekhar Reddy recently sold one acre of land to a person named Kashiram. However, to their surprise instead of one acre, entire four acre and four guntas of land was transferred in the name of Kashiram on papers. “Two officials asked me not to raise this issue and said we would be given ?3 lakh. The two officials also threatened to kill me or my father, if we approached the police with a complaint,” Sangareddy said.

Meanwhile, on Thursday Sharath went live on Facebook again thanking chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for responding to his plea and helping him get back his land. The seven acre land was on the name of Sharath’s father Shankaraiah, but local revenue officials transferred it on the name of another person. After seeing the video on Facebook, KCR contacted Sharath and informed him that he has asked collector Bharati Hollikeri to visit his village and resolve the matter. While collector Bharati Hollikeri said the records have been rectified, another problem cropped up pertaining to the same land.

A woman who claimed to be Sharath’s relative released an audio in which she said that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has not heard her side of the story. Identifying herself as Jyothi, she said she is the daughter of Shankaraiah’s brother and a dispute was going on over the ownership of that land. An official in Mancherial collectorate told TOI that the woman had visited the collectorate and wanted to meet the collector to explain about the issue.

Hi-Tec City Metro gains techie traction; total riders now 2.2 lakh 

","
HYDERABAD: The opening of the new Hyderabad Metro Rail line between Hi-Tec City and Ameerpet has come as a boon for several passengers, especially those travelling to the IT hub for work, from places in Secunderabad, Uppal and beyond. Owing to the better frequency, many have ditched the MMTS and company cabs to opt for the Metro.


Among them is Vineesha Etta, an IT professional who commutes between Seethaphalmandi and Hi-Tec City every day. “I used to avail the MMTS until now as those trains too cover the same stretch. The problem with MMTS is the frequency — which runs up to an hour— and its multiple stoppages. Metro has a much higher frequency.”




Also, the travel time is significantly lesser, said passengers. “Earlier I used to get down at the Kukatpally Metro station and take a cab from there to Raheja Mindspace. Now, I can go up to Hi-Tec City. It has reduced my commute time by almost half an hour,” said Pratima Jain, a resident of Uppal.

Records of the Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited (HMRL) indicate a jump of 40,000 footfall per day across all stretches — from 1.8 lakh to 2.2 lakh — since the launch of this route on March 15. “The footfall on the Ameerpet - Hi-Tec City stretch is sure to cross the 60,000 per day mark by next year. We are also expecting the overall numbers to touch 3 lakh per day by then,” said NVS Reddy, HMRL managing director. He also held a meeting with heads of IT companies this week to urge them to run shuttle services to Metro stations.

“We have assured them of adequate parking space. Instead of cabs and buses dropping individual professionals to their respective houses, they can drop them to our stations and we can arrange for last mile connectivity at the other end as well. We have received a positive response from most of the companies and will be working out the modalities soon,” NVS Reddy added.

But despite its growing popularity, those using private vehicles are still assessing the pros and cons of the new transport system. Rahul Abhishek Sahu, who regularly travels from Ameerpet to Madhapur on his two-wheeler said: “This my second ride in the Metro. While it is undoubtedly convenient, so is my bike. Whether I take the Metro regularly will depend on the time taken and convenience of travel during peak hours.”

Leopard strikes fear in two tribal hamlets 

","
HYDERABAD: The leopard which strayed into Yacharam mandal continues to keep fear-stricken villagers on tenterhooks. In the latest attack, the big cat pounced on a cow at Ekwaipally village near Maisigandi on Wednesday night, leaving behind half of the carcass.


The last attack, which was five days ago, took place in two places — Cherikonda thanda and Gangumalla thanda — which are 15 km apart. The two attacks at Cherikonda and Gangumalla on a single day have also raised suspicions among forest officials that there is more than one leopard. However, this is yet to be confirmed.

Yacharam is a cluster of four reserve blocks spreading over 6,000 acres. “We have set up camera traps and cages with baits to lure the leopard and have been monitoring its movement. We suspect there is one male and one female leopard straying into nearby villages in search of food and water,” said Amangal forest divisional officer M Janakiram.

Setback for TRS in MLC polls, 3 candidates it backed lose 

","
HYDERABAD: In a setback to the TRS in the MLC elections, three candidates backed by the ruling party lost in the elections to the Warangal-Khammam-Nalgonda Teachers’ constituency and the Karimnagar-Nizamabad-Adilabad Teachers’ and Graduates’ constituencies. Polling for these seats were held on March 22 and the results declared late on Tuesday. In fact, in two of the three seats, the TRS-backed candidates were relegated to third place.


The pink party has been winning all elections since the formation of the state and coming to power in 2014. Since then, many elections were fought by TRS, including the Medak Lok Sabha and assembly bypolls, MLC elections, Rajya Sabha elections and recently-held gram panchayat elections, the results of all of which went in favour of TRS.




Though MLC elections were held on non-party basis, all the major parties such as TRS, Congress, BJP and CPM have fielded their supporters as candidates in the elections. The parties have made it a prestige issue and even deputed their MLAs and ministers for campaigning.

In the Warangal-Khammam-Nalgonda Teachers’ constituency, Pula Ravinder, sitting MLC and Progressive Recognized Teachers’ Union (PRTU) candidate who was backed by TRS lost to CPMsupported candidate and United Teachers’ Front (UTF) candidate Alugubelli Narsi Reddy. Of the 18,885 votes polled, Narsi Reddy secured 8,9754 votes, while Pula Ravinder got 6,218 votes.

In the Medak-Nizamabad-Adilabad-Karimnagar Graduates’ constituency, Congress candidate and ex-MLA T Jeevan Reddy was leading by over 20,000 votes when last reports came in, while BJPbacked candidate Sugunakar Rao came second. TRS-backed candidate M Chandrasekhar Goud was pushed to the third spot.

But, their main complaint is lack of price for their produce which hit a downward spiral in the last four years. A quintal of turmeric, which was quoted at Rs 8,100 in 2015-16, fell to Rs 5,850 in 2016-17, Rs 5,858 in 2017- 2018 and further dipped to Rs 5,200 in 2018-19.


Surprisingly, turmeric rate of last year in other markets like Sangli (Maharashtra) at Rs 8,500 a quintal, Salem (Tamil Nadu) Rs 8,010, Erode (Tamil Nadu) Rs 7,500, Warangal Rs 7,300 and Duggirala (Andhra Pradesh) Rs 6,300 was much better than the Nizamabad market price. In the last four years, 2,57,930 quintals of turmeric was purchased at the Nizamabad district market and 14 lakh quintals this season.

In fact, turmeric’s prized extract, curcumin, a compound found within turmeric, is grown mostly in Armoor mandal falling under Nizamabad Lok Sabha seat.

Telangana farmer does FB live narrating his problem, CM KCR calls him after watching it and solves his issue 

","
HYDERABAD: A farmer from Mancherial, Sharath, who did a Facebook live about their family being deprived of their land by a local revenue official got help from chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. KCR spoke to Sharath on his phone for five minutes after his post came to his knowledge on Wednesday.


Within half an hour, Mancherial district collector Bharati Hollikeri rushed to the residence of Sharath in Nandulapalli village in Nellela mandal and sorted out the matter. A Village Revenue Officer (VRO) Karunakar, and revenue inspector Peddiraju were suspended for changing the land records. Sharath said in his FB post that the seven acre land which was on his father Kondapalli Shankaraiah’s name was transferred on to another individual’s name in the village by the VRO.

After the issue was resolved with the intervention of the chief minister himself, Sharath said in an FB post that KCR understood the problems of farmers well and the country needs a leader like him.

Sharath had done the FB live from in front of the tahsildar’s office at Nellela on March 18 explaining his problem and how that the family was also not able to benefit from the government’s scheme for farmers only because their land had been illegally transferred on to another person’s records by the VRO. On his Facebook id ‘Mana vyavasayam mana pantalu mee rythu sharath’, he urged for KCR’s help in solving his issue as for the last 11 months, he had approached several officials, including the collector but they only responded saying that it will take time.

In the telephonic conversation with Sharath, KCR told him he had seen his post and the negative comments that were made against the government by those who were not aware of what all the government was doing. When KCR asked him to fax his complaint to him, Sharath informed him that he would have to go to Bellampally, which was 20 km away and do it. KCR then asked him to write a complaint on his FB and would take it from there and initiate action. “Officials will be at your doorstep in half an hour. You don’t have to go anywhere,” he told him.

KCR explained to Sharath about the plans he would implemented from June for resolving such issues. “Just like how you have complained about the problem, you also inform the public how you have got help through FB which you have used,” KCR advised him. Sharath did that and also spoke to the media about it.

Data leak: HC notices to EC, UIDAI and AP 

","
HYDERABAD: Justice Shameem Akhtar of the Telangana high court on Wednesday issued notices to the state of Andhra Pradesh, its Chief Electoral Officer (CEO), Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) CEO and its AP registrar asking them to state their stand on the petition filed by Ashok Dakavaram, CEO of IT Grids, urging the court to quash the FIR registered by Telangana police against him and his company.


“Although AP is contending that data was not stolen, the relevant authorities to clarify the matter would be the AP authorities, the Election Commission (EC) and the Aadhaar wings,” said Dakavaram’s counsel Sidhartha Luthra, and made these authorities respondents to his case. “Criminal procedure was amended to enable victims to intervene in the case. As the data alleged to have been stolen belongs to EC and Aadhaar departments, their entry would clear the air,” he said. The judge issued them notices asking them to respond to the case by April 22. Senior counsel S Niranjan Reddy, appearing for Lokeshwar Reddy, the complainant in the case, told the court that the conspiracy in the case cannot be unravelled by merely bringing in the EC and UIDAI. “They are only custodians of the data. The victims are the people of AP,” he said. “Dakavaram is not revealing how he got the data,” he said, adding that the case filed by Ashok is nonmaintainable. The judge said he will look into the maintainability as well as merits of the case in the next hearing on April 22.

Revenue department yet to rectify 2.5 lakh mistakes in records and passbooks 

","
mahesh/7.50 pm

Hyderabad: Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao may have taken responded to the grievance of a farmer in Nennela mandal in Mancherial district and instructed swift action on the issue and finally got it resolved the issue within hours. But over 2.5 lakh cases pertaining to various complaints like mistakes in pattadar passbooks, part B (disputed land) and unclear land have not been resolved across the state under the much-hyped Land Records Updation Programme (LRUP). Of the total 58 lakh agriculture khatas, the mandal tehsildars have not digitally signed to issue passbooks.

Consider this, SV Ramana had applied for passbook for his land in survey no 147A/1/1 in Malyala village in Bommalaramaram mandal in Yadadri district one year ago and still he is waiting for his passbooks. Like Ramana, several lakhs of people waiting for their passbooks.

The Telangana government had taken up LRUP in September, 2017 with an objective to purify age old land records and to put an end to the land disputes, but the revenue department has not been able to rectify the mistakes even after one and half years. The revenue department could not launch `Dharani’ land records website officially due to technical glitches.

The Chief Commission of Land Administration (CCLA) department, coordinating department for LRUP, taken up the programme in 10,823 villages in 568 mandals by deploying 1,523 teams involving various levels of government officials in the revenue department to visit the village and check the land records and ground position. But many places, the Tehsildars did not go to villages and depend only on the village revenue officers.

According to government statistics, of the 1.94 crore survey numbers in the state, 1.84 crore survey numbers were clear and 10.16 lakh survey numbers land was no clear. “Of 58 lakh agriculture khatas belonging to farmers, only 52 lakhs were signed by the mandal tehsildars and pattadar passbooks were not signed for 5.81 lakh which comes to about 12.72 lakh acres,” an official of the CCLA said.

“The LRUP has become a money minting programme for some officials. The revenue staff demanded Rs 10,000 per acre for issuing pattadar passbooks for me. Since I refused, I did not get it,” P Ramana Murty, a resident of Dharmasagar village in Warangal district said.

When tried to contact special chief secretary (revenue) department Rajeshwar Tiwari did not respond.

Mystery shrouds disappearance of Hyderabadi man, kin knocks MEA door 

","
HYDERABAD: The disappearance of a 24-year-old man from Hyderabad who is said to have gone to Bangladesh without his parents’ knowledge remains shrouded in mystery. Mohammed Imran had told his family that he was going to Kolkata but made a desperate call from Bangladesh recently. Imran’s mother Zuleqa Begum, a resident of Riyasatnagar on Thursday, wrote to external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj to help locate her son.


Zuleqa said her son was working in a dry fruits shop in Muttrah, Oman and was there for 15 months. He came to Hyderabad on December 16, 2018 and had told his family that he had made friends in Oman who were from Bangladesh and was going to Kolkata for a meeting but went to Bangladesh on February 14, 2019. He had called the family the first time on February 18 to inform them that he was in Bangladesh. Before that, the family had got in touch with the employer in Oman who informed him that no Bangladeshis were working in his shop. 

According to Zuleqa, her son spoke to her recently, and told her that he was in Bangladesh. “He said he has been kidnapped and kept in a house with many others and he does not know his location,” she said in a letter to Sushma Swaraj. Imran reportedly spoke to Zuleqa from an Omani number and was carrying two phones, both of which are switched off since the last time he called her on March 21. Zuleqa told TOI that when Imran called her on March 21, he told her that he was taken to a location which is far away from Dhaka. She said that the people who he had met there had taken away his passport, cash and bag and that he was not being allowed to return to India.

Zuleqa urged Sushma Swaraj to help her locate her son and appealed to the Indian High Commission in Bangladesh to file a police complaint in Bangladesh to locate him.

Lok Sabha elections 2019: PM Narendra Modi guns for KCR, lashes out at Telangana CM’s ‘family rule’ 

","
MAHBUBNAGAR: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday lashed out at Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for promoting corrupt dynastic politics and family rule during his first rally in Telangana after the announcement of Lok Sabha polls.


Hitting out at the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) chief for his belief in astrology and fostering family rule, Modi said the present elections were between a ‘chowkidar’ on one side and a dynastic and corrupt rule on the other.

“Astrologers seem to have advised him to go for early elections. If the elections were held nine months later, in April or May 2019, KCR was told by astrologers that the TRS would lose both assembly and Lok Sabha polls,” Modi said at a public meeting at Bhuthpur village in Mahbubnagar district.

Stressing how public money could have been saved by holding the polls together, Modi asked: “Will it be the people of Telangana or astrologers?” He said that KCR went for advanced polls but took his time in forming ministry, paralysing the administration for two to three months.

The PM said the people of Mahbubnagar strengthened the political career of KCR and his family, but they did not get anything in return. “He became MP. Later, when Telangana was announced, he became chief minister. His entire family, son, daughter and other family members also benefited, but the people of Mahbubnagar did not derive any benefit during the time KCR represented them in the Lok Sabha between 2009-2014,” he said.

‘TRS govt hijacked Central schemes’

He criticised KCR for his association with AIMIM, saying the CM was resorting to appeasement politics. “The TRS-MIM alliance is not for the benefit of the people. He is moving closely with people who insulted the country and prefers to give reservations on the basis of religion,” Modi said. He claimed that earlier governments at the Centre used to create rifts between castes and religions, but NDA government introduced 10% EBC reservations. Many central schemes, he claimed, were diverted by the TRS government and labelled as state programmes.

When netas give street food a political tadka 

","
Hyderabad: Prime Minister Narendra Modi may well be the most well-known ‘chaiwala’ of the nation, but there are other lesser-known chaiwalas in the two Telugu states trying to strike a chord with the electorate. They are those who are stirring a gastronomic delight in the cauldron of ‘khichdi politics’. 

As the election date draws closer, candidates are trying every trick in their political bag — from lavish spending to vote-buying and to literally falling at voters’ feet — to ensure poll success. Some brewed cups of India’s favourite ‘adrak chai’, others did deep-fried crunchy ‘pakoda politics’, while some others tried their hand at crispy masala dosa or spicy ‘mirchi bhajji politics.

Dosa: Batter of success?

With assets worth Rs 75 crore, Vasundhara Devi probably must have never tried her hand at making a dosa or iron clothes in her life. The wife of actor and sitting TDP MLA, Nandamuri Balakrishna, while campaigning for her husband in Hindupur constituency was seen ironing clothes at a laundry shop in the constituency, and even making dosas at a street corner. Devi then requested everyone to vote for her husband Balakrishna. The husband-wife duo even headed to a local Anjaneya Swamy temple to seek the blessings of Lord Hanuman for a possible victory in the elections. Balakrishna is worth over Rs 100 crore, both movable and immovable assets put together.

The garland weaver

Tirupati is the abode of Lord Venkateswara, known as alankarapriya — the one who loves jewellery and garlands. Fragrant flowers play a major role in daily rituals and decoration of Lord Venkateswara, an eye-feast for lakhs of his ‘bhakts’. Devotees’ love for the Lord is mainly expressed in offering garlands, a major source of livelihood for locals, many of whom are voters. If it’s ‘the art of making garlands’, one must learn from former MP and senior Congress leader, Chinta Mohan, who is trying his luck from the Tirupati Lok Sabha seat. During his campaign, the seasoned politician was seen with vendors, intricately weaving pearly-white jasmine buds with tulsi leaves to string a mala. Will the ‘flower power’ bloom for this six-time MP and former Union minister is something that remains to be seen, but for now he will be facing formidable rivals like Panabaka Lakshmi (TDP) and Balli Durgaprasada Rao (YSRCP).

Andhra Chaiwala

Modi’s ‘chaiwala’ image spawned national ‘charchas’, almost becoming a symbolism of national politics. Chai with an extra adrak is often brewed with hot politics at tea stalls across India, and Pyakaraopeta in Visakhapatnam perhaps is no exception. Probably inspired by Modi’s tea-boy background, Bangaraiah, a doctor with the King George Hospital, is frequenting tea stalls not just to seek votes but to make a hot cuppa over politics. The doctor, contesting on TDP ticket in Pyakaraopeta MLA constituency, saw tea stall as the best beginning to become part of that symbolism. Remains to be seen if he can doctor a victory in the elections over chai politics.

Puri politics

Main toh raste se ja raha tha, main toh bhel puri kha raha tha, is how Govinda expressed his love for Karisma Kapoor and bhel puri in Coolie No. 1. In Anakapalle, people don’t relish bhel puri as much as pesarattu and puri with potato curry. Jana Sena MLA candidate for Anakapalle constituency, Paruchuri Bhaskar Rao, thought that if Balakrishna’s wife can make dosas, he can fry a crispy puri over politics. On campaign trail, Bhaskar Rao, a cousin of Ganta Srinivasa Rao, the HRD minister of Andhra Pradesh, tweaked the Coolie No 1 song to Main toh raste se ja raha tha, main toh puri bana raha tha.

Barber politics

In the 2018 Assembly elections, Muthireddy Yadagiri Reddy of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) set a new benchmark in political canvassing. He showed off his impressive shaving skills at a barber’s shop in his Jangaon constituency, well in a traditional wet shave style by applying rich lather on the beard of a customer. Muthireddy had clean shave when he earned over 91,000 votes — almost 30,000 more than his nearest rival Ponnala Lakshmaiah of Congress — in the Assembly elections.

No water supply for three weeks, students face heat ahead of test 

","
HYDERABAD: Three thousand students of the Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts of India (Icfai) have been facing a tough time after the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) stopped Manjira water supply to their campus in Donthanapally in Medak three weeks ago.





Icfai authorities as well as the water board’s top brass confirmed that the educational institution has been facing a severe water problem.

The water board used to supply 200 kilo litres of Manjira water a day to Icfai, Shankarpally campus. Providing a reason for the halt in supply, general manager (O&M division VIII), Patancheru, HMWS&SB, G Ramakrishna told TOI, “Water levels in Manjira reservoir have gone down considerably because of which we had to stop supply.”

On campus, the situation has become unbearable. Chief manager (public relations), Icfai, TV Ravindra told TOI, “We do not have a separate water supply network and depend on Manjira supply system. Though there are nine power borewells on premises, six have dried up. For the first time in several years, we are facing a severe water problem.”

Students of various hostels on the campus said the water problem couldn’t have come at a worse time, as they are preparing for exams. “The Manjira supplies have stopped. We are struggling,” a student said.

Icfai authorities have written a letter to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao highlighting the gravity of the matter. “We made a representation to the CM’s office and are waiting for a reply,” Ravindra said.

A senior water board official said, “If Icfai arranges for tankers, we will ensure supplies.” Icfai authorities met water board managing director M Dana Kishore recently and urged him to make alternative arrangements so students in hostels do not suffer.

AgriGold scam: HC seeks AP CID, firm’s response 

","
Hyderabad: The Telangana high court on Wednesday sought the response of Andhra Pradesh CID and AgriGold management on whether there is any truth to the allegations that one of the directors of the scam hit company, Avva Hemasundara Vara Prasad (Raja), and several others had diverted Rs 700 crore of the company’s funds to their personal accounts and that they were purchasing various properties through benami mode.

The division bench, comprising Justice V Ramasubramanian and Justice P Keshava Rao, issued the directive while hearing a PIL filed by Telangana Agrigold Customers and Depositors Association seeking a CBI probe into the Agrigold scam. The counsel for the petitioner submitted an affidavit to the court, bringing to its notice the media reports from AP that spoke about the diversion of funds. It was pointed out that such illegally bought properties were not attached by the AP CID.

The bench was told that the response to the auction of the high value property-Haailand- in Vijayawada was lukewarm. This was happening despite scaling down the price of the asset to Rs 500 crore. The bench said that alternatives to selling such high value properties have to be explored and that this would be done in June, when the court reopens after vacation. 

The court permitted Andhra Bank to take an amount of Rs 4.83 crore of the total Rs 8.88 crore earned from the sale of assets belonging to M/s Ritwik Energy Systems Ltd, a subsidiary company of Agrigold group. It directed the bank to place the remaining amount in a cumulative interest bearing account for final disbursal. 

The court also permitted Corporation Bank to proceed with auctioning of Agrigold properties mortgaged with it but with a rider that it should not confirm the sales without the court’s permission.

15-yr-old rescued from child marriage 

","
Hyderabad: A 15-year-old girl from Mallapur was rescued from child marriage by a team of officials including Nacharam police on Friday.

The girl was supposed to appear for exams on Friday which she had to miss because of her marriage ceremony.

The victim, a Class 10 student of a government school in Mallapur, whose marriage was scheduled at 11 am, was to wed a 21-year-old relative, who is a private driver from Yadagirigutta.

""The marriage was supposed to be held at a committee hall in KL Reddy Nagar under Nacharam police limits. The bride was rescued and the parents were counselled,"" said a police officer.

""The girl, a bright student, was reluctant to get married. She had called the child helpline before the marriage and was thus rescued. The officials obtained her age proof certificate from the school. We are demanding the school to conduct a fresh exam for her, or else she will lose one year,"" said Achyuta Rao of Balala Hakkula Sangham, an NGO.

This is the 11th child marriage prevented by the NGO this year alone. On Thursday, a 14-year-old girl was rescued from child marriage at Kalapathar area.

As many as 75 child marriages were prevented by the Rachakonda police in the last two years, with 47 marriages stopped in 2018. Police had rescued 28 minors aged between 15 and 17 in Yadadri district alone.

According to a senior officer, Rachakonda police have been identifying families of girls who are appearing for Class 10 exams and conducting awareness programmes in the villages.

""Minor girls studying in Class 10 are vulnerable to child marriages. We are identifying such families and counselling them as such marriages usually go unreported,"" said a senior officer in Rachakonda.

Residents of Bolarum seek better security 

","
HYDERABAD: Residents of 40 colonies in New Bolarum are seeking better security measures ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, days after a six-year-old girl was brutally raped and murdered.


The colonies in New Bolarum and Alwal, which falls under the Malkajgiri Parliamentary constituency, houses over 30,000 residents.

The horrific incident led to many residents joining a massive rally taken out by students of Holy Angels high school on Tuesday.

Slogans of “we want justice” resonated in the area as angry residents demanded better security measures for women and girls.

“There is an urgent need for action. There is a need for increased patrolling and a police outpost near Turkapally gate,” tweeted Senthil Kumar, a resident.

Residents rue that not a single political leader had come to the rescue of the parents, who are daily wage labourers who migrated from Medak district to find work.

“Quick investigation and justice is needed for the family. There is a need for the government to provide day care centres for children of daily wage workers at Turkapally gate as a tribute to the girl,” said Reynolds Das Kuntam, a social worker from the area.

The police said there is already enough protection being provided to residents. “In the last three months, we have installed over 1,000 CCTVs in the area. Additional measures such as conducting surveys, patrolling of the area, holding sensitization programmes for the residents are also being conducted. It was a gruesome incident but the police cannot be held responsible for it,” said V Padmaja, deputy commissioner of police (Balanagar zone).

While the accused Rajesh was arrested on the subsequent day, the police is yet to receive post-mortem report to further conduct the investigation.

Hyderabad: Get ready for hot summer ahead 

","
HYDERABAD: Get ready for hot and humid weather conditions over the next few days as the mercury level touched 38.2 degree Celsius on Tuesday and is set to cross the 40 degree Celsius mark soon.


Meteorologists at the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad forecast that the mercury levels in the city will touch 40 degree Celsius by April 1 and will gradually rise throughout the month. 

Along with the day temperature, even the night temperature is on the rise. While it usually settles below 20 degree Celsius, it is hovering between 25 and 29 degree Celsius. At 25.8 degree Celsius, the minimum temperature recorded on Tuesday was three degree Celsius above normal.

The IMD has attributed rise in temperature to an upper air trough extending from Lakshadweep area to east Madhya Pradesh across north interior Karnataka, Marathwada & Vidarbha. 

“Due to the blowing of hot and dry southerly winds, some pockets of Rayalaseema and Telangana might cross the mark of 40 degree Celsius. Hyderabad would observe hot and uneasy weather conditions,” read a weather report issued by Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency. 

According to the Telangana State Development Planning Society (TSDPS), temperature in areas such as Pashamylaram, Maitrivanam, Khairatabad, Lingampally, Madhapur, Bandlaguda, Quthbullapur, Bahadurpura, Musheerabad soared to 39 degree Celsius. Other areas recorded day-time temperature between 35 and 39 degree Celsius. 

The maximum temperature in districts has already touched the 40 degree Celsius mark. According to IMD, Hyderabad, Bhadrachalam, Mahbubnagar, Medak and Nizamabad were the hottest districts in Telangana with maximum temperature of 40-41 degree Celsius. “For the next three days, maximum temperatures are expected to be two to three degree Celsius above normal at few places, which are in the range of 37 degree Celsius to 40 degree Celsius,” read a weather forecast issued by TSDPS.

SIT not following leads: YS Vivekananda Reddy’s daughter 

","
HYDERABAD: Former MP YS Vivekananda Reddy’s daughter YS Suneetha on Wednesday charged that the Special Investigation Team (SIT), set up by Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu, was not following the leads based on the suspicion expressed by the victim’s family. “I doubt the credibility of the investigation,” Suneetha said at a press conference here. She gave a detailed presentation on the incident and the activities of those who she suspects had a role to play in the crime.


Former MP and YSRCP leader Vivekananda Reddy was found dead under suspicions circumstances at his residence in Pulivendula village in Kadapa district on March 15.

Suneetha said the local inspector is also aware of the facts, then why is the truth not coming out. “What exactly is happening behind the scenes?” she questioned, adding that her father was working towards making her cousin YS Jaganmohan Reddy the chief minister of AP and also got Y Avinash Reddy reelected from Kadapa.

“We have been informing the SIT about whatever information we have and whoever we suspect. They are taking into custody and questioning those who were close to my father, including the family members. But they are not going after those whom we suspect. Why are some people not being investigating despite my complaint? We are going through a lot of pain and we are being targeted?” she said.

Suneetha said her family members were taken into custody by the police and have still not been released, while the real culprits are roaming free. “Why is Chandrababu Naidu protecting Adinarayana Reddy (TDP leader)? Why is Naidu targeting our family?” she questioned.

Suneetha said she had also raised doubts on Parameshwara Reddy who had been an associate of her father and got admitted in a hospital in Kadapa at 4.30am on March 14. “All tests were normal. He was on the phone most of the time,” she said.

“Did I tell anyone that my father died of heart attack? Why was that information spread? The question is who committed the crime? I am a senior doctor. I am not a political leader. For more than 10 years I was in the US, training and working there. My concern is my father has been murdered. Politicians are misrepresenting the facts and using his murder for their political gains,” she added.

In her presentation, Suneetha said Parameshwara Reddy was discharged from the hospital against medical advice at around 5.30pm and met TDP workers at Haritha hotel. He got readmitted at 8.30pm in the same hospital. She also suspects a nexus between Adinarayana Reddy and Parameshwara Reddy.

Land dispute: Two convicted in advocate murder case 

","
Hyderabad: A local court on Wednesday convicted a 25-year-old man and handed him life imprisonment, while his associate was sentenced to under one-year imprisonment for the murder of an advocate in Chennapuram near Jawaharnagar in 2016.

Advocate A Uday Kumar, 47, was murdered at his farm in Chennapuram on June 25, 2016, by D Lokesh Babu. Later, Lokesh put the body in the advocate’s Maruti 800 and drove it to the outskirts of Keesara Dayara and set it on fire.

The XIII Additional District Judge Court, LB Nagar, on Wednesday convicted Lokesh Babu to undergo life imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 2000, while Singireddy Suman Reddy, 25, both residents of Chennapuram, was convicted and handed out one-year imprisonment. He was also directed to pay a fine of Rs 2,000. Three other accused —Anjaneyulu, Singireddy Mahender Reddy and K Madusudhan— were acquitted.

Uday’s father A Nakuludu had earlier given his five-acre land in Chennapuram on lease to Anjaneyulu, uncle of Lokesh. When he wanted to sell the land for Rs 25 lakh, Lokesh evinced interest in the land parcel and even signed an agreement.

When Uday got to know about the transaction, he was reluctant to sell the land, leading to quarrels between him and Lokesh.

On June25, 2016, Lokesh and Uday had a quarrel about the issue at the latter’s farm. Lokesh attacked him with a sickle on the neck, causing his instant death.

Lokesh contacted his friend, Suman Reddy, who helped him shift the body into Uday’s car. Lokesh drove the car to the outskirts of Keesara Dayara, poured petrol on it and set it ablaze. 

The Jawaharnagar police had then registered a case and arrested five of them. After trial, the court convicted the two on Wednesday.

Leslie Wickman: ‘It’s hard for space scientists to watch sci-fi movies as they are more fantasy than science’ 

","
Leslie Wickman earned the nickname ‘The Rocket Girl’ when she was working on NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope as a research scientist in the late 1980s. The rocket scientist in her illustrious career has worked on various international space station programmes and has recently authored a book on the relationship between faith and science. “It’s not true that scientists are non-believers. I want people to understand that one doesn’t have to choose between science and faith — rather, they can be both pious and scientists at the same time,” said the dynamic Leslie, who was recently in the city for a talk. “This is the first time I am in India. During this visit I have travelled to Delhi, Mumbai, Bhopal and now Hyderabad. Every state is unique in its own right and I absolutely love the warmth and hospitality of the people here,” she says, adding that in her career, she has worked with a number of Indian scientists.
Hyderabad Times caught up with the American for a candid chat and she opened up about an array of subjects such as how she got hooked to astronomy, unrealistic sci-fi movies, the Big Bang Theory and more. Excerpts:


‘My dad fuelled my curiosity in astronomy’Growing up in North America as a young and curious six-year-old, Leslie was fascinated by the sky, stars and the universe — thanks to her dad, who too was an astronomy buff. “As kids, my dad would throw questions at us about the universe and taught us how to use a telescope. As a child, it was fascinating to see the celestial bodies and it fuelled my curiosity about the universe,” says Leslie, who later took up Astronomy in college and went on to pursue her dream of becoming a rocket scientist. But that’s not all, Leslie was also actively involved in sports during her college years and was a professional American football player with the California Quake and also played volleyball. 


‘I made special devices for smooth functioning of the Hubble Space Telescope’
During the late 1980s, Leslie played a key role as a research scientist for the NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope programme. She worked on multiple aspects of the space telescope and was also the brain behind engineering various devices for the smooth functioning of the mission. Reminiscing her experience, she says, “In the programme, I was involved in making sure that all the astronaut interfaces were operating properly. I also developed special tools and devices to make sure that the astronauts don’t face any difficulties getting into narrow spaces in the spacecraft. It actually becomes 10 times more difficult to move or even crane your head wearing those big bulky space suits in them,” says the 52-year-old. Additionally, she was also involved in designing a portable foot restraint which is a stable platform to stand on for astronauts whenever they need to work outside the spacecraft. 


‘The world should team up for space missions’
Talking about the India’s Mangalyaan mission and other countries having their exclusive space missions, the astronaut says, “I believe countries need to start pooling their resources and collaborate their endeavours rather than duplicating each other’s efforts because it is a massive amount of money and work that goes behind each space venture.” 


‘The aerospace industry today is very inclusive’ Talking about women in aerospace, Leslie says that the once male-dominated industry today has become highly inclusive. “As an old guard, if you may, I started working in this male-dominated industry when there were only a few women representatives. But with changing times, today it is wide open for women and other 
under-represented groups,” she says. 


‘Hollywood sci-fi movies are often unrealistic’Talking about representation of science in cinema, the scientist confesses that she has a hard time watching most of Hollywood’s sci-fi offerings. “They are more fantasy than science,” Leslie quips, adding that often they are difficult and uncomfortable for her to fathom since the situations they portray on screen are often unrealistic. Citing the example of the 2015 movie The Martian, starring Matt Damon, she said, “The movie did have some good parts, but it also had a lot of unrealistic fiction. There were points which made me go, ‘What is this man even trying to do?’ The point where he was trying to repair the space ships with plastic sheets. Then, when he cut a hole in his space suit to navigate better — the space gas could have killed him!” she says. Leslie adds filmmakers take a lot of liberty while making sci-fi flicks. “It’s very hard for me, as a space science researcher, to watch these movies but I understand that the directors make it for commercial purpose and hence use their creative liberty.” 


‘The Big Bang THEORY asserts that every beginning necessitates a beginner’
She goes on to say that flawed interpretation often leads to conflict between science and religion. “The illusion of conflict between science and religion seems to be perpetuated primarily by fundamentalists at the polar extremes of this dialogue,” says the scientist, adding, “The Big Bang model asserts that the universe had a beginning and a beginning necessitates a beginner. God reveals himself in both scriptures and nature — the two cannot logically contradict each other. So the key to a fuller understanding of God lies in understanding the theological aspect and the scientific angle which are interdependent,” says Leslie.

OUJAC extends support to Nizamabad farmers’ cause 

","
HYDERABAD: Upholding the plight of Nizamabad farmers, members of the Osmania University Joint Action Committee and other voluntary groups, on Thursday, came together to fight for the rights of farmers.


Addressing a press conference at the Osmania University Arts College, representatives of these groups — including Citizens Political Front, Telangana Youth Force and Janatha Vikas — sought justice for the turmeric farmers who have been demanding classification of turmeric as a food crop and payment of better remunerative prices for their produce.

“The TRS-led government has failed to address the farmers’ issues forcing many of them to file nominations as a mark of protest. While turmeric has a large international market, farmers have been deceived by the mediators and have not received prices that they deserve,” said Jaya Vindhyala, convenor of Citizens Political Front, adding that the farmers should have the right to decide remunerative prices for their crops. Turns out, of the total 185 candidates in the fray from the Nizamabad constituency this election, 170 are farmers.

Lashing out at major parties, the social groups claimed that the TRS and the BJP were running a syndicate of their own and ignoring farmers’ demands, like setting up of a National Turmeric Board and reopening of the Nizam Sugar Factory.

“Political parties have ignored farmers’ issues. The TRS is hand-in-glove with the BJP at the Centre. The farmer’s protest in Nizamabad is a clear indication that they now demand a change in the Lok Sabha election. It is up to us now to encourage that change,” said Hareeth Ruda, from Janatha Vikas.

Doctors visit Kamareddy after 3 die of water contamination 

","
HYDERABAD: A day after two children and a woman died after drinking contaminated water and 68 others were hospitalised in Kamareddy, a team from Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) visited the district to verify the cause of deaths. The five-member team collected water, food and ice cream samples from the Area hospital and from Komalancha, Galibpur and Magdoompur villages. They are expected to submit the preliminary report on Thursday.


Health officials said no new cases were reported on Wednesday. Of the 68 patients hospitalised on Tuesday after eating food at a feast held at Yellammagudi on Sunday night, 43 have been discharged, while the remaining are still under observation. “Eleven children and 14 adults are still under observation and most likely to be discharged in a day or two,” said Dr P Chandra Shekhar, district medical and health officer (DMHO), Kamareddy.

“Most of those hospitalised are children, so there are chances that the water and milk used for preparing the ice cream were contaminated,” the DMHO added.

District collector N Satyanarayana said health officials have also sent samples from 21 places in three villages to Institute of Preventive Medicine and report is expected to be released in next 48 hours.

On Tuesday, four-year-old S Rishitha and seven-year-old D Satyanarayana died while undergoing treatment at Niloufer Hospital, Hyderabad, and Government General Hospital, Nizamabad, respectively. Gajula Sunitha (32) died at Area Hospital in Banswada. While Rishitha and Satyanarayana consumed food at a feast at Yellammagudi, Sunitha had food at another feast at Magdoompur.

Telangana high court notice to KCR on Gajwel win 

","
HYDERABAD: Justice Shameem Akther of the Telangana high court issued notices to Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhara Rao and several election authorities on Tuesday asking them to explain their stand in an election petition that challenged the election of KCR from Gajwel assembly constituency.


Thammala Srinivas, a voter from Gajwel, filed this petition urging the court to set aside the election of KCR on the ground of suppression of information. He contended that the chief minister had violated various provisions of the Representation of People’s Act relating to filing of nomination papers.

Interestingly, he made Vanteru Pratap Reddy, who contested in the assembly elections and lost to KCR, as a respondent to the case.

Generally, all election pleas are filed by defeated candidates. In this case, the defeated candidate, too, joined TRS. Now, a voter from the constituency filed a plea challenging KCR’s election.

The petitioner’s counsel C Damodar Reddy told the court that KCR had concealed information in his nomination papers about the cases registered against him, the dues he owed to the government and various other details.

Also the precise details of his income through different means were also not furnished, he said. This is a clear violation of the provisions of the RP Act, he said. The Electoral Registration Officer of Gajwel constituency, the Election Commission of India and the District Election Officer and District Collector of Siddipet were made as respondents in the petition. The judge directed the respondents to file counters and postponed the hearing.

Development pitch to strike gold in Hyderabad 

","
HYDERABAD: On his padyatra, which began at Eithebar Chowk in Old City and weaved through Mir Alam mandi area, three-time MP and MIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi asked people to come out and ‘Vote for the Majlis’. Stopping to meet tea-stall owners, shopkeepers and even getting on to a local bus to greet the driver, Owaisi left no stone unturned to connect with people and said that development would be his main focus.




Kites, the MIM party symbol, showered down from a terrace during Asad’s rally on Thursday

“Road-widening, improvement of Osmania hospital, making south zone a flood-free area and development of Karwan are among the issues I will be taking up,” he said. While speaking about the traffic situation, he said the Pathergatti-Gulzar Houz stretch will be a priority. To ease the situation, Metro works need to be completed, Owaisi added. When asked about how the AIMIM has often been blamed for creating hurdles in the path of Metro work, the MP said this was a “complete aspersion”. “When the authorities came to me stating that religious structures were in the way, it was I who provided a solution. I told that the stretch connecting Falaknuma must be extended till the RGI Airport,” Owaisi said.

Not to be left behind on the development front, BJP too is giving a tough fight, emboldened by a supportive Centre. BJP candidate Bhagwanth Rao is driving the battle from Behti Bhavan in Old City, a headquarters of sorts for the party’s activities.

Attacking Owaisi, Rao said even minorities do not want to vote for the MIM president but are doing so because the three-time MP has kept them in the dark without development. “The MIM halted all progress in Old City. The party created hurdles, whether it was for Metro project or implementation of central government schemes. Keeping this area underdeveloped and diving the people helps them retain power,” said the BJP candidate, adding that the party had no policy on education, agriculture, power, industry or housing, all of which have been neglected. If brought to power, he said he would focus on creating educational opportunities, cleaning up the Musi and other civic amenities.

Replying to this, Owaisi claimed that among the 17 MPs in the state, he was the only one to have used up his MPLADs funds. “The RTI should be used to get the truth out. I have developed educational institutes, mineral water plants and college buildings.”


WINNING PROSPECTS

BJP is not only trying to make inroads into the AIMIM bastion, but is hopeful of wresting the seat itself. Claiming that he would easily win the seat by a huge margin if there were no malpractice, Rao said, “The last time I took on Asad, there was widespread booth capturing. At 3pm, only 15-20% polling had been recorded, but by the end of the day reports came in of 90% polling. Even if every voter took about two minutes to cast their vote, this outcome would not have been possible.”

He, however, said this time, the situation will be different because the previous poll was held when the UPA government was at the Centre, but now NDA government will ensure fair polling. “The Election Commission will be able to ensure that guidelines are followed and bogus voting prevented.”

While stating that he does not believe in the role of social media, and prefers approaching voters face-to-face, Rao added that this time the BJP’s campaign will be like a “surgical strike” to oust MIM. “TRS and MIM go hand-in-hand. Both are dynasty-based parties. What I want to know is why the TRS is fielding its candidate from Hyderabad at all when they have an understanding with the MIM in other constituencies?” Rao asked while stating that all other candidates in the fray were there only to divide the ‘nationalist vote’.

Owaisi merely said that he could not underestimate his opposition till voting ends. On accusations of malpractice, he said, “BJP won 280 seats at the Centre. If that was not won through malpractice, can’t I win one?”

When asked about who he would align with — Congress or BJP — if he had to do so, the MP remained non-committal. He said a “non-Congress, non-BJP” government would be the only way forward and hoped a regional player occupies the PM’s chair. “There are regional leaders who have better vision and one may go beyond the Modi vs Rahul choice. With Jagan set to make a mark in AP and TRS doing well here, parties like MIM, TRS or Jagan will play a crucial role in government formation.

Rs 16 crore gold seizure in West Bengal in just 18 days 

","
KOLKATA: After the polls were announced on March 10, multiple central agencies, including Customs, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and income tax, have seized gold worth Rs 16 crore in Bengal, including seizures amounting to Rs 9 core in Kolkata. The EC has sought a detailed report from these agencies and asked them to enhance inter-agency coordination.





According to EC reports, between March 10 and March 28, gold worth nearly Rs 16.5 crore was seized by various agencies in Bengal.

“Kolkata, traditionally, is a transit point. It is also the port of entry from south-east Asian countries. However, the pre-poll seizures are being analyzed seriously,” said a senior officer.

According to EC, the seizure of gold in Bengal during the 2014 Lok Sabha election was around Rs 2.8 crore. During the 2016 assembly polls, the figure was Rs 7.5 crore.

Prompted by this huge seizure in just 18 days, the EC has asked all concerned agencies, including BSF, state police, Customs, DRI, the I-T and Excise departments to submit a report within a week. All of them have also been asked to conduct inter-departmental meetings and make a coordinated effort to stop the flow of cash, gold and liquor in the state. “In addition, the commission is sending 44 expenditure observers for the 42 constituencies of the state. We will also make special arrangements like deployment of assistant expenditure observers, additional flying squads, static surveillance teams and video surveillance teams as required. We are trying to identify the vulnerable constituencies and will put them on 24-hour surveillance,” an EC official said.

Fear stalks locals even 6 years after child was raped, killed and dumped in drain 

","
Kolkata: Six years after a two-and-a-half-year-old child was abducted from under the Kidderpore Road ramp of Vidyasagar Setu, raped, brutally murdered and dumped in an open drain, fear stalks the eight to 10 families who still reside there. A city court on Thursday sentenced the accused, a 41-year-old stablehand, to death. 

“We weren’t here that night in July when the incident took place. The child’s grandmother lived with her family on the opposite side of the road to us. When she raised an alarm after the girl went missing, we rushed to help,” said Sk Chandu, a 36-year-old who drives a horse carriage near Victoria Memorial. “That night we searched for the girl all over. Even the police were informed, but we could not find her. Instead, we found the accused, Suresh Paswan, but let him go after he denied seeing the child. We did not realise then that he had tortured and murdered her,” he said.

Most of the women in the locality are ragpickers and beggars. The men either tend to horses or drive horse carriages off Victoria Memorial. A few even own horses.

The incident left them traumatised. Sakina Sk, another local, said, “We were so scared that we decided to move in with the child’s grandmother. Every family has children and we have to step out for work. So we decided to stay together to ensure the safety of our kids. We all have been living together since then.” 

The locals said they had been told by Hastings police to detain any unknown person loitering in the area and alert the cops. Locals Sibhrania Sk, said, “We make it a point to have at least a couple of elders in the area keep an eye on the children when we go out to work.”

Two-wheeler skids on tram tracks, rider crushed under bus 

","
Kolkata: Two persons were killed in two accidents in the city on Friday. 

The first incident took place on the busy AJC Bose Road close to the Moulali crossing around 1.50pm. According to cops, a man on a scooterette skidded on tram tracks and came under the wheels of a private bus. The 30-year-old victim was taken to NRS hospital where he was declared brought dead. Till evening, the Taltala police was trying to ascertain his identity.

Investigators said the probe so far indicates the two-wheeler rider was trying to overtake the bus on route 240 and was crushed under the its rear wheels. “There was little the bus driver could do. We are taking help of our CCTV cameras to ascertain if this is what happened. The fatal squad will now take over the case. However, we will also ascertain if the tram tracks where the accident took place are damaged. We know that the man was wearing a helmet. A case has been recorded at Taltala police station,” an officer said.

Some local residents claimed the incident exposes the sorry state of the tram tracks along Sealdah-Moulali and on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road between the Park Street and SN Banerjee Road crossings. The tracks have not been repaired since 2017, they claimed. 

CTC officials, however, denied the allegation and said there was no problem with the tracks near Moulali as they undergo “regular inspections”. 

The other accident took place on Basanti Highway in the wee hours of Friday. Bhojerhat resident Jyotsna Saha, 50, was run over by an unidentified vehicle while she was trying to cross the highway around 12.30am. Cops said she was most probably hit by a truck. Saha was rushed to CNMC Hospital where she was declared brought dead. 

 Kolkata Leather Complex police have registered a case of death due to rash and negligent driving in this regard.

13-year-old chokes to death trying to imitate WWE stunt 

","
KOLKATA: A Class-VII student, a fan of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) stunts, allegedly choked to death in his Duttabad home on Thur-sday evening while apparently imitating a wrestling move with a nylon belt. 





Parents of 13-year-old Bikash Sardar said the boy had tied one end of the belt to a bamboo shaft that ran across their ceiling and the other end around his neck. He was found hanging between the bed and the wall when his parents found him. “He was a huge fan of WWE and was always hooked on to the cellphone, watching videos. He may have tried to imitate stunts he had seen in the videos with the belt and suffocated to death. We don’t think he committed suicide. It must have been an accident,” said his father Sunil, who works as a mason.

With WWE’s annual event Wrestlemania around the corner, YouTube feeds are flooded with video suggestions for any average freestyle wrestling viewer. Sunil said the last video Bikash had been watching was a tag-team match between the teams of John Cena and CM Punk against Roman Reigns and Dean Ambrose. “He was possibly trying a stunt with the belt around his neck. He may not have realized that he could choke. Had it been a suicide, the boy would have climbed to the bamboo shaft using a stool or a chair,” said a neighbour. 

According to police, Bikash had returned from school around 5pm on Thursday. His parents, who had gone to the bank, returned around 5.45pm to find their son hanging in his room. “Seeing his feet dangling in the air, my wife almost fainted. I brought him down with the help of a neighbour, but he was already dead. I passed out from grief,” Sunil said. 

Neighbours took the boy to Bidhannagar Subdivisional Hospital where he was declared “dead on arrival”. The hospital authorities alerted the cops. “It is difficult to ascertain if it was a case of suicide or accident. But we have sent the body for post-mortem and have started an unnatural death case,” said an officer.

Bikash’ friends and family members said he had always been a fan of professional wrestling and would constantly watch wrestling videos on his father’s cellphone. TOI had access to the phone and found multiple WWE videos in the YouTube search and viewing history, and some were even saved on a playlist. Neighbours said they had often seen Bikash imitating WWE moves.

Psychologists said some children are more impulsive than others, lacking a sense of dangers that could be inflicted by themselves. This is where parents need to counsel them properly. “We need to educate the children that what they see in the virtual world is often staged. Only proper counselling can deter children from such acts,” said psychiatrist Jai Ranjan Ram.

Shows like WWE usually come with a disclaimer cautioning viewers against imitating the stunts shown, but these are often ignored. “Parents need to keep a check on the kind of things their children watch and stay alert about any change in behaviour. If needed, parents should monitor what kids watch videos and inform them about the ill effects,” said psychiatrist Siladitya Roy.

Govt must be on alert this Ram Navami, say clash-hit 

","
Asansol/Kolkata: Residents of Asansol-Raniganj are yet to come to terms with the violence there during Ram Navami celebrations last March. 

A maulana of an Asansol mosque had lost his son while many shops owned by Hindus were razed. People are still haunted by those memories even as Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal prepare for Ram Navami celebrations on April 13-14 this year.

“I feel pained by the incident. I hope things are better this time. I have nothing against celebrating Ram Navami as long as it doesn’t hurt others. The Asansol mayor should see to it that there is peace and amity in the area during Ram Navami,” said Maulana Imdadul Rashidi, who had lost his son. 

Shop-owner Uma Shankar from Shib Mandir area thinks alike. “The administration needs to be alert. There should be no trouble during Ram Navami processions,” he said.

VHP has already started scouting for participants for the 350 Ram Navami rallies planned in West Bengal this year. The festival falls within the Lok Sabha poll schedule beginning April 11.

Posters and festoons are already on display urging Hindus to take part in the rallies in defence of “Hindu brothers and sisters” against the perceived but purported threat of Islamisation. “We are expecting more than 10 rallies in each district headquarters. These apart, a central rally will be organised in each town. A medium-sized rally should at least have more than a thousand participants,” said VHP media in-charge Sourish Mukherjee. There are plans to organise mega rallies in Krishnanagar, Ranaghat and Jangalmahal, where BJP has gained considerable support. 

Apart from the rallies, VHP has put forward a demand in the run-up to Ram Navami preparations. The outfit’s secretary general, Milind Parande, has given a call for “the release of three Hindu girls and a full stop on atrocities on Hindus, their culture and places of worship in Pakistan”. The Pakistan angle is in line with the BJP narrative of using the recent outpouring of nationalist sentiments following airstrikes against Pakistan.

Unable to beat the saffron surge, a section of Trinamool leaders has decided to take a leading role in observing Ram Navami when they had once tried to counter it with Hanuman Jayanti programmes in the districts. 

Asansol mayor Jitendra Tiwari has written to the additional district magistrate seeking permission to disburse funds to organisers of Ram Navami celebrations. “This is nothing new. The municipal corporation has been providing funds to organisers for the last three years. I sought the permission this time because the model code of conduct is in force,” Tiwari said. 

VHP and Bajrang Dal have already contacted local clubs and temples in areas that don’t have akharas like the ones in Kharagpur. Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh is an active participant in Ram Navami rallies. Ghosh, now the BJP candidate from Midnapore, has to take a call this year. The Bajranj Dal has planned a 10,000-strong motorbike rally from Chandrakona Road in Midnapore on the occasion.

A road trip that spread smiles in 12 countries 

","
It takes hours for the small boats to reach Chios, Greece, from the shores of Turkey. They start sailing after midnight so that they are not easily spotted by the Turkish coast guards. If you are a volunteer working in that area, you get a call at around 3 am from the EU coast guards. They seek the help of the volunteers to provide immediate relief and aid to the traumatised immigrants who managed to survive. Most of them had never seen the sea before,” recalled Dominik Metzger, a young energy engineer, who, along with friend Luca Toboll, reached Kolkata after travelling through a dozen countries for six months.

After entering India through the Wagah border early this month, Dominik and Luca explored different nooks and corners of India and neighbouring countries. “We went to Nepal and Bangladesh from here and also visited Jim Corbett National Park to get a glimpse of some big cats. But hard luck, we didn’t see any!” exclaimed Dominik as he gorged on roadside kochuri-torkari while talking to us. Kolkata is their last pit stop and from here, their caravan-like van will be ferried back home to Germany, and Dominik will carry on his journey to Cambodia and Vietnam before bidding adieu to his landmark trip. Meanwhile, Luca, who is studying Musikvermittlung — a branch of music studies that also involve education — will leave for his studies.


Passing through conflict zones
Dominik, 23, and Luca, 25, started their journey on October 14 last year from Germany. “Dominik and I are not from the same town. We met in Kenya in 2015 and by 2016, we decided to go for this epic trip. We started planning. Though we did not meet often, we Skyped almost every week. A lot of planning went into the trip. Besides the adventure part, our objective was also to spread happiness. We put up a website and raised some money so that we could help the people in need on our way,” said Luca, who is currently holidaying in Kerala. They bought a van and remodelled it. “The van was of a 1995 make. We converted it into a camper. The vehicle has cost us €3,900 and the remodelling €5,000,” said Dominik.
From Germany, they drove through Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Albania before they reached Greece. “We spent around three weeks in Greece — between October 21 and November 10. That was probably our longest pit stop. Volunteering there was one of the most extraordinary experiences of our trip,” he added.

Up close and personal with refugees
Their itinerary involved quite a few conflict-ridden countries, including Iran, Turkey, Balochistan and others. “When we started planning in 2016, several European countries were facing a refugee crisis. We saw the welcoming nature of our countries change into a harsher one. People started saying, ‘They (refugees) are coming only because of the money the German government pays them’. Hence, we decided to go to the Middle East to see how the people are living there, to know more about their culture and their situation. We wanted to share our experiences with the people who are reading our blogs and following us on Instagram,” said Dominik, adding, “People in my country started judging these refugees without knowing anything about them, without knowing the reality.”

Recollecting their experience of doing volunteer works with immigrants in the Greek Island, Dominic said, “It is not just the Turkish people, but the Syrian and Iraqi immigrants, who cross the land borders of Turkey, risk their lives to reach Chios and the other bordering Greecian Islands. A vessel that has a maximum capacity 20 people carries as many as 60-65 people. Mothers cling on to their children to make more room for fellow passengers. Some of these people don’t know the dangers of an overcrowded boat. While many boats reach the shore, some fail and sink. These survivors are the people who seek asylum in EU countries. We are still a long way from solving the problem. However, we could work together to make the living conditions of these asylum-seekers more humane and dignified,” he paused.


Exploring the unknown
In their trip, the duo made sure that they became a part of the communities they passed by. “We could have flown from one place to the other and explored the world. But we chose the road trip so that we can experience the culture and heritage of each country. I found similarities in customs of many countries. For example, several things in Greece are similar to Turkey and so on,” said Dominik. But it was Iran that surprised them the most. “Iran is not a popular travel destination. Hence, the local people embrace you more warmly than other places. They want tourists to visit their country more often. And the country is so picturesque. I absolutely loved it,” Dominik added.





Throughout their journey, the duo also experienced an array of incidents. “After entering Balochistan, Pakistan, we were escorted by local authorities. Initially, there was just one gunman. As we ventured deeper into Balochistan, more cars joined us. By the time we reached Quetta, capital of Balochistan, there was a mini tank and four motorcycles with armed men. It was a bit scary. But we were treated extremely well. And, of course, we tasted the street food in Lahore before crossing the Wagah border,” said Dominik.


In our subcontinent
After reaching India, the duo also visited Nepal and Bangladesh. “My girlfriend, Valentina Celahmetovic, joined us in Bangladesh. She visited many places and homes with us. From there, Valentina and I went to explore Kerala, while Dominik stayed back in Kolkata,” Luca told us, adding, “I have experienced various shades of Kolkata. We have seen poor people spending nights on the streets. I have also seen posh properties in New Town. It is an interesting city and I am sure I’ll be back.”




Meanwhile, Dominik is making the best of his stay in Kolkata. “I am living with a family in Ballygunge. On Holi, I got back home and was drenched in colours. It was so much fun,” said Dominik, who has also visited the Sundarbans and worked in several homes. “In one home, I found some kids who are interested in music. Some play drums and some play the guitar. I have planned to get some instruments for them. I will come back again,” he said.


Blogging all the way
 
Throughout the trip, both of them chronicled their journey in a blog. “The objective of this journey was to spread smiles. While planning our trip, we raised money through crowdfunding. In Istanbul, we met people, who had been deported back to Turkey after their failed attempt at fleeing their country. We bought jackets for the kids and other items for the families. In Greece, we gave the refugees a box containing warm clothes, some food and medicine. In our blog, besides writing our travelogues, we also record our expenditures on such endeavours,” Dominik added. There journey came to an end recently. However, they promise to come back. “Our mission is to put smile on the faces of the people we meet on our way. That aim 
will bring us back,” Luca signed off.

One For The Road 

","
If one were to use a street as a metaphor for a myriad contradictions, it would have to be S N Banerjee Road, the one-way street that’s a lifeline for commuters travelling from Kolkata’s eastern neighbourhoods to the central business district and Howrah, and which is among the busiest in the city.

Yet, it is caught in a time warp, with the fabric unchanged for nearly two centuries. One of the oldest streets in Kolkata that figures in the city’s earliest maps, it is usually a picture of chaos with buses, cars, van rickshaws and hand-pulled rickshaws jostling for space with jaywalkers and porters.

It is also the street of choice for rallyists, which earned it the moniker ‘Michhil Sarani’. Commuters can never be sure when they will reach their destination. On the odd day when there is no rally or traffic snarl, they could travel the 1.8km stretch between Moulali and Chowringhee in 10 minutes. On most other days, they’d be stranded for hours.

Yet, 25 metres below its surface, an ultra-modern two-way commute system is in the making, one that promises to re-establish order and transform commute into a breeze. The only hint of the giant machines boring twin tunnels for the Metro line that will also connect the city’s east to the centre and across the river to Howrah is the odd scaffolding that has been erected to support old mansions.

Even as the tunnel-boring machines snake their way through the earth like giant caterpillars, the imperious buildings, stately mansions and private homes built on either side of this thoroughfare over three centuries remain cocooned in the past, oblivious to the chaos that streams through the street in between all day.

The road itself can be divided into two distinct halves, neatly demarcated by the tram tracks that cut through Wellesley: the half towards Moulali is primarily residential, and the one towards Dharmatala is essentially commercial. There is a demographic divide too, with the residential half occupied by families that have lived in the city for generations, and the commercial half by migrants, both traders and labourers.

The sights and smells are also contradictory, ranging from the cloying essence of incense sticks to the inviting aroma of freshly fried kachuri-cholar daal, chowmein and chicken rolls sold in shops and roadside kiosks and from an air redolent of biryani and chaanp and the intoxicating whiff of country liquor to the invigorating odour of spices and perfumes to the subtle steely smell from lathe workshops to even the stink of raw fish sold on the pavements.

Beyond the streets, though, not much appears to have changed, at least on the surface. True, time has left its mark on several buildings. But they have weathered the seasons and stood firm, shoulder-to-shoulder, zealously protecting the old-world fabric that other neighbourhoods in the city have lost. “Ensconced in these buildings are tales of people who have resided or visited. There have been many famous personalities — such as pre-Independence era politician Surendra Nath Banerjee, after whom the street is named, his father and legendary medical practitioner Dr Durga Charan Banerjee, and hockey coach Pankaj Gupta, who had trained the legendary Dhyan Chand, a gold winner at three Olympic Games,” recounts 68-year-old local resident Dr Shankar Kumar Nath, an oncologist-cum-historian.

Other luminaries who had lived on the street include Rani Rashmoni, Ramakrishna Paramhansa and Kazi Nazrul Islam. Indian Mirror Street, off S N Banerjee Road, is named after the first newspaper to be published in India. On the very road lived Congress veteran Bijay Singh Nahar, whose house was frequented by the tallest politicians. A couple of houses away is where Bollywood star Nargis was born.

The most famous building on the street, and perhaps the oldest, is Rani Rashmoni’s mansion. Prasun Hazra, 54, a sixth-generation descendant of Mathur Babu, Rani Rashmoni’s son-in-law, to whom she bequeathed her vast estate that comprised nearly half of the plots on either flank of SN Banerjee Road, says the road led straight down to present-day Babughat prior to the construction of the Governor House. “Rani Rashmoni used to take a palanquin to bathe in the river every day,” he says. “It is from there that she had taken a boat ride, during which she had the vision of a Kali temple and founded Dakshineswar. Its most famous priest, Ramakrishna Paramhansa, lived in the house for a month, conducting both Durga Puja and Jagaddharti Puja.”

The Durga Puja, which began in 1790, continues in the mansion’s courtyard that is now fragmented and divided among descendants. Along the mansion facade are rows of shops retailing spices, betel but and other ingredients for mishti and zarda paan.

Further up the road is the house of another family with links to Ramakrishna. Its current resident, 82-year-old Arun Kumar Sarkar, great-great grandson of Mahendralal Sarkar, the personal physician of Ramakrishna and the founder of Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), lives in a nearly three-century-old house on this road. An inconspicuous entrance, nestled between rows of jewellery shops, leads to the lime-washed impressive thakur-dalan in the otherwise dilapidated house.

“The deed of the house with the address 102 Janbazaar Street states that this plot was given to zamindar Ramdhan Ghosh by the British in the 18th century in exchange for land acquired to build Fort William,” Sarkar says. “Other families, such as the Chatterjees and the Sadhukhans, were similarly compensated. That is how many families settled on either side of the road that was later named Corporation Street and, still later, S N Banerjee Road.”

A room in the house facing SN Banerjee Road once had a laboratory that was frequented by physicist C V Raman, who went on to win the Nobel Prize some years later. “It was through the recommendation of Mahendralal Sarkar’s son, Amritalal Sarkar, and Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee that Raman got a position in IACS. He used to come here to conduct his experiments,” Sarkar says. The room adjoining the lab was a baithak-khana or drawing room. It is now the CPI(ML) party office.

Back then, the street, illuminated by gas lights, was sedate. Ox and bullock carts carried goods, aristocrats travelled in horse-drawn carriages and the wealthy in motorcars. “Even in my childhood, it was relatively quiet,” recalls Montu Kumar Daw, who owns a pawn shop on the street and lives nearby. “In the late 1960s, the first private bus arrived. The 1970s saw the influx of the Bihari population and an explosion of hand-pulled rickshaws. Rallies began around the same time and continue to this day.”

The burgeoning population and traffic apart, he says the biggest difference has been the lack of upkeep, especially cleanliness. “Earlier, the streets used to be washed. Though there were cowsheds, we didn’t know what mosquitoes were, except in textbooks, till the 1960s,” says the 66-year-old.

Further up the road is the four-century-old Sitala temple that also houses the idol of Dharmaraj. Septuagenarian Kalyani Pandit Bhattacharya, a descendent of the temple founder, says Dharmatala derives its name from the temple deity. “Back then, this area had palm trees, and hence, the name Taltala,” she recounts.

Further still is Osmond Memorial Church, established in 1868. The congregation at the church has dwindled but it has lost none of its grandeur. Next to it is Taltala Library Row, a narrow alley that leads to the city’s oldest functioning public library founded in 1882. Though the 40,000 books are now gathering dust, residents are proud of the heritage. It had nearly shut down for want of funds before Amitendra Nath Chattopadhyay, 58, stepped in.

A seventh-generation descendent from the ‘Jungle-kata Chattujye’, a moniker given to the Chatterjees after a patch of thicket was cleared to build their house in 1758, following the family’s displacement from where Fort William is now situated, Chattopadhyay has made provisions of renting a floor in the library for children’s tuitions to fund the library’s bare needs.

“Sadly, in this age of e-books, no one wants to borrow real books. Unless we digitize the library, the books will be lost forever,” he rues.

But it is not just the library that is facing an existential crisis. Down S N Banerjee Road near Esplanade, is a half-burnt building which, till a few years ago, housed Bourne & Shepherd. Established in 1863, it was one of the first photographic studios in the world, with agencies across India, London and Paris. A devastating fire destroyed much of the studio’s priceless photographic archive.

“The age of digitization had not arrived then. Much of Kolkata and, indeed, Indian history documented in photographs, were lost forever,” recounts Utpal Biswas, 68, co-owner of Metropolitan Photo Stores next door, which is also on the brink of exiting the photography business that has become largely irrelevant with the advent of digital photography and cellphone cameras.

Not just photography stores, cinemas, too, are on the way out. Two theatres on the street — Lotus and Elite — have downed shutters; Regal is on the sickbed. With all single-screen theatres in the belt, except New Empire, shutting down, it is only a matter of time before the projector’s whirr falls silent.

Anadi Cabin, on the same footpath, is also a pale reflection of its glorious past. Known to once serve the best Mughlai paratha and mutton kasha, its haloed clientele in the last century included matinee idol Uttam Kumar. Now, few noteworthy people stop to bite into the greasy stuff it dishes out.

Another shop on the opposite footpath has, however, managed to hold its own. A few years ago, it even got a fillip when it featured in the movie ‘Piku’. A scene in the film featured megastar Amitabh Bachchan cycling to the shop and buying kachori.

The road also houses two magnificent mixed-use domed buildings, fine specimens of colonial architecture, complete with projected pediments, balconies with plain columns and Corinthian capitals. The Whiteways and Laidlaw Building, constructed in 1905, was the headquarters of the firm set up in 1882 by Robert Laidlaw with branches in 20 Indian cities and Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Shanghai. The building housed a department store on its ground and first floors with the two other floors housing apartments and offices that continued till 1962. The store continued until 1962, after which it was acquired by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co, which renamed it the Metropolitan Building. Following years of neglect, the building was restored in early 2000 and now houses a modern department store.

Another building, Futnani Chambers, built a century-and-a-half ago, is crying for repairs. The building, which once housed a famous nightclub called Golden Slippers, famous for classic jazz and rock ’n’ roll and housed the head office of shoe giant Bata India, is now dilapidated. But the 120-odd tenants, including Mughlai restaurant Aminia, which occupy the building, are confident that the “rock-solid” building can weather another century with ease.

Legend has it that among the residents in the quarters above was Rabindrasangeet exponent Debabrata Biswas, popularly called George-da. Old-timers recall how Goerge-da would sit on the balcony with his feet spread out, humming songs even as the building’s residents went about their daily chores. The music has changed now. Garishly dressed crooners now belt out Hindi film numbers in the two cheap bars — Delite and Paris Bar — at the building’s ground floor.

The street has two other watering holes that serve country liquor — Barduari and Khalashi Tola — and are patronized by the subaltern: porters, rickshaw-pullers and other daily labourers. It’s difficult to now imagine that these very rudimentary bars once attracted poets Sunil Ganguly and Shakti Chattopadhyay.

The twin tunnel-boring machines will carve out two tunnels under S N Banerjee Road. One will pass under the pavement adjoining Futnani Chambers and the Kolkata Municipal Corporation headquarters, which has had Subhas Chandra Bose among its many distinguished mayors. The other will pass under Metropolitan Building. Both tunnels will run parallel till they turn left below Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road and head towards Sealdah via Wellington Square and Bowbazar.

Seated in a dust-laden shop with the magnifier loupe fixed to his right eye, 75-year-old Kanhailal Dutta peers into the innards of a wrist watch that has stopped ticking. Behind him is a grimy showcase and a green wall, on which hang many clocks that haven’t found takers.

“The days of watches and clocks that required to be manually wound have passed,” Dutta says. “In fact, even battery-operated watches are not finding takers as people now check the time on their cellphones. I once had a dozen repairmen working under me. Now, I am the sole person attending to the odd client. The business started by my forefathers will last as long as I do,” remarks the silver-haired owner of Time Corner, where time itself appears to be delicately balanced on the cusp of change.

Kolkata man steals profs’ mobiles, uploads obscene posts 

","
KOLKATA: Police arrested one person on Thursday night and recovered two mobile phones, which belonged to two women professors — one of them the head of department of English and the other her colleague from the same department — of a reputable south Kolk-ata college. 





On March 15, a man had walked into the staff room of the college, stolen the mobile phones of the two victims, and from there sent vulgar and threat messages to their phone and social media contacts. The entire operation was completed within the first three hours of the theft, leaving little time for the victims to react. Police said the person arrested had merely bought the mobile phones and was not aware about the crime. 

“By the time the profe-ssors managed to block their numbers, the damage was already done,” said an officer from south division. “We have fixed up the identity of the actual thief and the person to whom he had sold the mobiles. We are looking for a gang that worked with a typical modus operandi. Once we nab these two men, we can join all the missing dots,” he said. 

According to the complaint filed by the college authorities, a copy of which is with TOI, the accused had entered the college about two weeks ago around 2.30pm on the pretext that he had some work at the accounts departments. The guards were convinced and the accused walked up to the first floor, where the staff room of the English department is located, and stole the two mobile phones along with some valuables.

What followed, though, left the college administration clueless even as the secretary of the governing body rushed to the local police station. “Several vulgar messages and posts were subsequently posted — especially on Facebook — on behalf of the victims. The duo had to rush to block the SIM cards after being alerted by their friends and kin. We fear that among those who saw those objectionable posts were students — both former and present — besides family, relatives and friends,” said a college governing body official.

The college launched a parallel investigation along with cops and traced the accused through CCTV footage. “We identified the man, who was wearing a full-shirt and a jeans and was carrying a bag on his shoulders. We shared the footage with the police and the detective department,” said a college official.

Police said that both the phones were recovered — one from Kolkata and the other from Midnapore. 

“The CCTV footage was helpful. We are questioni-ng the arrested person. We believe that there is more to this incident than what the ac-cused so far has owned up,” said an officer.

CBI to HC: Narada sting charges likely in a month 

","
Kolkata: The CBI on Friday told the Calcutta High Court that the chargesheet in the Narada sting tapes case will be submitted in about a month if necessary procedures are completed. 

Additional solicitor general Kaushik Chanda told the court of Justice Joymalya Bagchi that the agency was waiting for a report from the US on the iPhone used by Mathew Samuel, who conducted the Narada sting operation and published it on the website naradanews.com. The investigating agency is also waiting for a voice test report of the 13 accused in the case, Chanda said. 

The CBI will place its chargesheet in the case once these reports are received.

Chanda said this during the hearing of a petition by Trinamool MP Aparupa Poddar seeking quashing of the case against her in connection with the sting tapes, in which people purportedly resembling senior Trinamool leaders were allegedly seen accepting bribes. Poddar has been renominated to contest from the same constituency in the coming polls. The seven-phase Lok Sabha election in West Bengal concludes on May 19. 

Justice Bagchi issued a 16-week bar on CBI from taking any coercive measures against Poddar, the Arambagh MP, in the case.

Appearing for Poddar, Rajdeep Majumdar argued that CBI had not produced any concrete evidence against his client. Justice Bagchi then adjourned the case. The HC will hear the case again after 12 weeks.

Kolkata: KMC recruits 80 food inspectors 

","
KOLKATA: In a bid to strengthen its drive against food adulteration, KMC has stationed food inspectors across the city. According to a source, the civic body last month recruited 80 food inspectors to increase its vigil on sale of spurious food and drinks. The KMC health department has deputed food safety officers to guide the newly-recruited inspectors who have been deployed in each borough.


“We have split the force into 16 teams which will work in city’s 16 boroughs. Each borough will have five food inspectors who will look after markets shops, hotels, restaurants and eateries under their jurisdiction,” said a KMC health department official. Even a month ago, the KMC health department had only 12 food inspectors who would look after adulteration issues length and breadth of the city.

According to a civic official, recruitment of food inspectors will enable the KMC health department to visit wholesale markets and eateries across the city. “We have the stale chicken sale fiasco still fresh in mind. Besides, we know spices, edible oil and even packaged drinking water bottles are not safe in some areas of the city. Now we will at least be vigilant given the increase in the number of food inspectors,” a KMC official said. An orientation programme was arranged for the newly recruited food inspectors at the KMC headquarters.

Cruise to Dhaka via Sunderbans starts sailing 

","
Kolkata: The first passenger cruise between Kolkata and Dhaka was flagged off on Friday by secretary of shipping, Gopal Krishna, at a low-keyed event at G R Jetty in Garden Reach. The media was kept out of bounds for election code of conduct. This is the first such cruise after Independence. The cruise vessel, RV Bengal, will reach Dhaka on April 7. From Narayangunj in Bangaldesh, another vessel — MV Madhumati — has also started its journey to Kolkata.

With 19 delegates and officials on board this historic trip, the cruise vessel will touch upon Haldia, the Sunderbans on either side of India-Bangladesh border, Mongla port, Barison, Chandpur, Narayangunj and Dhaka. The vessel will follow Indo-Bangla protocol route. This is the result of secretary-level talks last October between the two countries.

“It’s a dream come true for all of us across the border. We wanted this so desper-ately. This has opened a new vista for passenger transportation between the two countries. The tourists can see the Sunderbans, a Unesco World Heritage Site, in its unfragmented proportion, 60-dome mosque at Bagerhat and ancient capital of Bengal at Sonargaon near Narayangunj,” said Raj Singh, promoter of R V Bengal.

The trip holds huge possibility in tourism, riverine transportation, bilateral relations and people-to-people contact, said an official. The trip had many stumbling blocks and ministers and bureaucrats of both the countries had worked in tandem to remove these barriers to make this happen, said a source in the ministry of shipping.

For the first time, property row triggers acid attack in Kolkata 

","
KOLKATA: A 34-year-old woman, residing near Ajeyo Sanghati club at Haridevpur in southwest Kolkata, was allegedly attacked with an “acid-like substance over a property dispute” while she was returning home on Wednesday evening. The woman, who received injuries on her face, was stated to be out of danger and was released from MR Bangur Hospital on Thursday.





Police have arrested the survivor’s 42-year-old sister and her 19-year-old son from Sanjberia in Narendrapur in the wee hours of Thursday for their alleged involvement in the incident. Cops said initial probe revealed that a property dispute between the two sisters was behind the incident and that this was the first time that an acid-attack case in Kolkata turned out to be a fallout of property dispute. 

According to the police, the woman — a widow — had crossed the club office and reached its rear side when she was confronted by her elder sister and her son on Banamali Banerjee Road. Police said that after a brief argument, the two accused, who were barefoot, threw “acid-like substance used as a toilet cleaner” on her face. As the woman cried for help, the accused managed to flee. She was rushed to MR Bangur Hospital where doctors admitted her at the emergency ward.

“We have recorded the survivor’s statement where she alleged that she was having a major financial dispute with her sister. The accused had been changing too many homes but we managed to nab them from an urban village area close to Bishnupur,” said an investigating officer of Haridevpur police that have lodged an FIR. “Doctors have told us that this was not pure acid and hence they are hopeful that the victim would recover,” said a police source.

The last recorded acid attack happened in Kolkata in 2018 at Anandapur. In 2017, there was an acid attack attempt on a 25-year-old woman in Behala’s Parnasree. In fact, the first acid attack case was recorded in Kolkata in 2016, when two such incidents took place in the city. 

NCRB annual crime report shows that 2016 recorded 283 incidents and 307 victims under sections 326A (acid attack) and 326B (attempt to carry out acid attack) of the IPC in India. Twenty-six percent of the incidents and 27% of the victims were from West Bengal. In comparison, during the same period, Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state with over double the population of Bengal, recorded 57 incidents and 61 victims.

Sources, though, said there had been a decline in acid attacks in Bengal in the past two years. “There are now specific goals to cut down on such attacks,” an official from Nabanna said.

The Acid Survivors and Women Welfare Foundation (ASWWF) had earlier claimed that Bengal recorded 220 such cases between 2010 and 2016, which is about 20% of all cases recorded in the country.

‘My granddaughter’s murderer deserves to die’ 

","
KOLKATA: The death sentence awarded to Suresh Paswan, the ostler who raped and murdered a two-and-a-half-year-old child in 2013, finally brought a sense of closure to the girl’s grandmother.





“Ever since the night my granddaughter went missing from the bed, I haven’t had a moment of peace. I can’t ever forget her bleeding, limp body, covered in injuries and cuts on her face and head. She had just started to learn how to talk. I fed her and put her to bed every night, but one night, I woke up to feed her, never to see her again. Her photograph is the only thing I am left with now. I was numbed by the sheer brutality meted out to her. I have always wanted that the culprit be hanged to death. He deserves to die. He took one life and destroyed two others. A few days after my granddaughter’s death, my daughter and my grandson went missing as well,” said the grandmother. The victim’s mother being mentally unstable, it was she who was bringing up the girl and her one-and-a-half-year-old brother. “The Army and police tried to move us out from below the bridge, but I held on. I stayed put for over six years, hoping the man is hanged and that is what happened today.” 

“My daughter being mentally ill, I brought my grandkids to my home. I do not earn much but I did my best to keep them fed and looked after. After the child’s death, my daughter decided her son was unsafe with me. So, she took him away to a house, where she looked after two elderly persons. But one day, my grandson went missing and then, I heard my daughter was missing, too. I was distraught but told myself I needed to keep fighting for justice. Today I stand vindicated,” she said.

Still living below the Kidderpore ramp of Vidyasagar Setu, the grandmother, who was deserted by her husband, has now remarried. 

“Initially I was sceptical how to go about the case but the cops and lawyers constantly helped me. They did whatever they could,” she said.

A dedicated haematuria unit adds to healthcare facilities in Kolkata 

","
KOLKATA: A just launched haematuria clinic has added to the latest health care services in Kolkata. Haematuria which is blood in urine could be indication for bladder cancer. Now this clinic will help in early detection for the cause of the haematuria and treatment on time.


While blood in urine may be harmless in some cases, it can also be an indication for serious health issues, particularly in those above 40 years of age and smokers. According to doctors blood in urine without pain or burning sensation in the urinary passage or abdominal pain, may be signs of cancer or tumour in the urinary tract. 

“Due to high prevalence of smoking, urinary bladder cancer is more common disease in Bengal compared to rest of India. Blood in urine, even a drop of it even once should be evaluated to rule out urinary tract cancers,” said Dr Abhay Kumar, uro-oncologist at Narayana Superspecilaity Hospital (NSH) Howrah.

The haematuria clinic at NSH Howrah is touted as the first such dedicated clinic in eastern India. According to the survey in the hospital 45% of uro-ocology patients (Including male and female) presenting with haematuria are suffering from bladder cancer while 10% are suffering cancer of the kidney. By launching the haematuria clinic the hospital aims to work on early detection for better treatment outcome.

In haematuria, kidneys or other parts of urinary tract allows the blood cells to leak into urine. Problems that causes this leakage, include urinary tract infections, kidney infections, bladder or kidney stone, enlarged prostate, cancer.

2 ‘sons of soil’ quit Darj poll fray 

","
Darjeeling: Two bhoomiputras have withdrawn from the Lok Sabha contest in Darjeeling, where the main contenders are GJM (Tamang)-Trinamool and GJM (Gurung)-BJP.

R B Rai of Communist Party of Revolutionary Marxist and Swaraj Thapa (GJM-Gurung) withdrew their nominations. While a CPRM spokesperson spoke of unity among Gorkhas, Thapa said votes should not go to parties that oppose the concept of Gorkhaland. Chhetri said his party would take 3-4 days to announce which side it would support.

According to Thapa, he had filed his nomination to create awareness among Hill voters not to accept outsiders as candidates. On the final day of withdrawal of nominations, only 16 candidates remained in the fray. Originally, 21 people had filed nominations. Had all remained, two balloting units would have been required as one can accommodate only 16 names.

Unrest grips Suri village in poll run-up

Suri: Crude bombs explod-ed in the dead of night at a Suri village on Thursday, sending out signals that the countdown had begun on Trinamool Birbhum president Anubrata Mandal’s turf. It happened after Election Commission caution-ed Mandal over his public speech and loaded gestures. 

Ground zero was Chandra village, 8km from Suri town, on a day central forces were staying put in Suri Police Lines. A police contingent reached the trouble-hit village to bring the situation under control. 

The violence kicked off a blame game. BJP’s Bolpur candidate Dudh Kumar Mondal said: “It is the usual tactic of Anubrata Mandal to intimidate the opposition ahead of polls.” Trinamool Birbhum leader Abhijit Sinha, however, saw no politics in the violence.

Hotels told to give daily guest updates 

","
Kolkata: The Kolkata and Bidhannagar police will be paying special attention to guest houses and hotels as part of their preparations for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. Police sources said that they asked the hotels to update their registers and inform them about all check-ins on a daily basis.

“Guests should be given rooms only after they submit copies of their identity cards. The hotel owners should submit details of guests with photocopies of their identity cards at the police stations every day before 10am. The hotel staff should alert the cops against presence of criminal elements and any suspicious activities on the premises,” said an officer.

“We have asked the hotel officials to be particularly careful about guests who have booked rooms in their hotels beyond three days. They have also been asked to keep tabs on guests who are keeping irregular hours or meeting too many outsiders,” he added. 

Police, though, did not just stop by merely stating the dos and don’ts. In at least 10 different hotels at Bidhannagar, the police checked several aspects — whether all the CCTVs are functioning, if they cover all the entry and exit routes, whether required apps (like C-form used to track foreigners) are installed and whether there’s a need to enhance security at the place.

Police said the area OCs have been directed to ensure that the local officers are in constant touch with the hotels and respond to emergencies. “The beat officers have been asked to visit the hotels,” said a source. 

Similar steps will be taken to identify unclaimed and new vehicles entering the city, said the police. The owners of parking lots have also been requested to pass on information to the police on vehicles that are unclaimed, abandoned or have been kept in parking places for a long time.

Tolly celebs bowled over by a googly!

Director Abhimanyu Mukherjee’s latest release, Googly, had a special screening at a city multiplex on Thursday. The film stars Srabanti Chatterjee and Soham in the lead. 


The film delves into the lives of Dali and Arjun, a couple suffering from a stammering problem. Their lives take an eventful turn after the birth of their son Googly, played by young Soumyadipta, and what happens next forms the crux of the story. 


The screening was attended by several Tolly celebs including Prosenjit Chatterjee, Koel Mallick, Kaushik Ganguly, Subhashree Ganguly, Raj Chakrabarty and others. Srabanti, looking stunning in a white and pink sari, said, “Stammering is not easy and I realised that while doing this film. Soham, as a co-actor, was of great help and so was the director. When Abhimanyuda offered me the role I was nervous, but later realised that I have to do it.”


Soham, who was seen interacting with the guests at the do, said, “Srabanti is one of the most talented actors we have in Tollywood. Her comic timing was excellent during the film. I am sure that the story of the film will definitely touch everyone’s heart.

Kolkata hospital brings latest technology for liver cancer treatment 

","
KOLKATA: The latest technology for treatment of liver cancer comes to the town. TARE (Trans Arterial Radio Embolization), an innovative procedure that uses special gadgets and micro-catheters to access the tumour to deliver precise radiotherapy. Such facility was unveiled at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals (AGH) in Kolkata on Friday.


In TARE the identified source of blood supply to the tumour in liver is accessed and intra-arterial radiotherapy is delivered using Yttrium-90 (a radiotherapy agent). This results in significant improvement and at times complete treatment of the tumor as well. 

“We are happy to announce this innovative procedures for our patients. We have started performing TARE, which would benefit our patients substantially. With this, Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, Kolkata becomes the first corporate multi-specialty hospital in the eastern region to perform this procedure,” Said Rana Dasgupta, CEO AGH.

The procedure is done in two sittings. In the first sitting, the tumour is identified by the angiographic evaluation and any potential source of extrahepatic organs are embolized to reduce the chances of radiotherapeutic agents going to other organs to avoid further complications. Following this, the dose is calculated and prepared usually in Canada or Singapore from where the dose is transported in a premeasured amount and delivered on specific dates using special system in the Cathlab.

“Primary liver cancers, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma and extensive metastasis or secondary deposits in the liver pose a great clinical challenge to treat, especially if they are progressive in nature despite all kinds of treatment. With a huge and increasing burden of hepatitis B and C patients, the HCCs are in rise,” said Dr Manash Saha, senior consultant vascular & non-Vascular Intervention at AGH.

Subways stay empty but jaywalkers put lives at risk to walk across roads 

","
Kolkata: Rampant jaywalking, in spite of escalator-fitted underpasses being in the vicinity, seems to have become a way of life for many in the city. Other than cops, no one is apparently bothered by this violation of road rules, though it is the primary cause of several accidents. 

Ask Papia Sarkar, who works at Salt Lake’s Paribesh Bhavan. Though a swanky subway has recently been opened at the Beliaghata-EM Bypass connector, the 50-year-old state employee still walks, and sometimes runs, across the road, putting her life at risk. She herself confesses to have had a narrow escape last week, but still thinks it is “convenient to use the road”. Pointed out with the subway, she has no reason to walk across the road amid cars and buses speeding towards her, she says: “I know it’s risky, but I can’t help it.” 

But not all are as reckless as Sarkar. “After the subway was opened last year, fewer people have been spilling onto the road,” a traffic officer said. KMDA, which built the subway, made the interior attractive, decorating it with pictures of football greats. Five escalators have been installed at the five entry-exit points.

The scene is no different on Deshapran Sashmal Road in Tollygunge. Twenty-two-year-old Archan Roy is seen hurrying past the underpass to meet a friend waiting across the road. “I can’t keep her waiting,” he said. “Better be safe than sorry,” a sergeant from the Regent Park traffic guard called out to him. But the JU PG student shot back: “I don’t have time to go down the stairs, walk 60 feet and then board an escalator to reach the other side of the road, when I can simply walk across.”

To control such errant pedestrians who refuse to use the underpass, which has remained underutilized ever since it was built in 2002, police have started using ropes to control them. “Chances of fatal accidents on this stretch are quite high. On February 16 last year, an elderly woman and her grandson were hit by a bus here. They survived but the accident could have been averted had they taken the underpass,” said a policeman. Commuters could be seen striding out of the Tollygunge Metro station on the road every few minutes but none took the subway. Police have put up barricades at the divider to dissuade pedestrians from crossing over, but they still wriggle past the barricades.

The nominal fine of Rs 10 to Rs 50 for jaywalking is cleraly not a deterrent. “It is practically impossible to prosecute everyone. Unless people realize the worth of their lives, what can we do?” an officer said.

Some 20 minutes away, Jadavpur 8B has a subway but the crossing seems to be the worst, when it comes to jaywalking. A middle-aged man is seen walking down the road with a phone to his ear even as vehicles move past him. The moment he realizes the camera is on him, he quickly runs to the other side. Another pedestrian seems completely unaware of the use of traffic lights. Even when the light is green, he walks across, waving a bus to stop in the middle of the road, so that he can safely walk past. The underpass is grossly underutilized due to several reasons, including lackadaisical enforcement. Traffic officers said extra hands were needed to stop pedestrains from breaking the rule. “Here, jaywalking is almost the norm. We try our best but more cops are required,” said an officer.

But strict monitoring does help, as is evident at Science City crossing, where subways are widely used and very few people break the rule. “The Science City subways have stairs but even then, they are widely used, thanks to a strict watch,” said a traffic officer.

Hit by bus, woman’s right hand crushed, saved by surgery 

","
KOLKATA: A bus rammed into a 30-year-old woman riding a scooter and injured her hand so severely that she had to undergo a surgery to save the limb. 

The incident took place on Thursday morning, when Atreyee Biswas, a medical representative, had just crossed Sukanta Setu on her way to Jadavpur. As the bus rammed into her two-wheeler, she was hurled to the ground and her right hand was crushed. After allegedly being refused admission by two private hospitals, she was finally taken to SSKM Hospital. 

Biswas had suffered blood loss and was in a severe shock. According to SSKM, she suffered a laceration and three of her veins and two arteries were severely injured. “The surgery had to be conducted immediately as blood supply to her veins and arteries were cut off. Even her pulse was missing. It was essential to restore vascular supply or she would have lost her hand,” said HoD of cardiac anaesthesia Sandeep Kar, who was on the surgery team.

The woman’s blood supply to veins and arteries was restored, but doctors are worried about infection. “She can move her hand. She needs an operation for bone stabilization through external fixation and a plastic surgery for skin graft. These can be done later,” said Kar. The surgery team included Angshuman Mandal, Subhendu Mahapatra and China Pal.

West Bengal: Maid steals diamond ring, slaps 62-year-old owner 

","
HOWRAH: Baby Devi, a domestic help working at 62-year-old Sharda Rathi's house in Howrah's Golabari, was arrested on Thursday for stealing a diamond ring worth Rs 1.10 lakh from Rathi's dressing table drawer. Earlier, when Rathi could not find the ring and asked Baby about it, the help slapped her and left her house. Police later recovered the ring from Baby. 

""The maid and the jeweller, who allegedly bought the ring from her, have been arrested,"" said Bhavna Gupta, ADC of Howrah City Police. The jeweller has been identified as Ananda Saha. Rathi said she took off the ring and placed it inside a drawer before going to the washroom. Just as she entered the washroom, she saw the maid get into her bedroom to clean it. Later, when she came out and opened the drawer, she found the ring missing. 

Soon, Rathi called other members of her family and told the maid she wanted to search her. At this stage, the maid allegedly slapped her before fleeing the spot. Rathi's grandson Anurag lodged a complaint against the maid with Golabari police. 

Police launched a raid and found Devi in her relative's house in Liluah. She confessed selling the ring to Saha, a Liluah jeweller, for Rs 80,000.

Cal HC lens on CBI’s validity 

","
Kolkata: Calcutta High Court’s Acting Chief Justice Biswanath Somadder will set up a Constitution bench to decide whether Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is a constitutional entity or not. 

The HC was hearing an appeal by one Chandan Biswas, who was sentenced by a special CBI court in 2018 for corruption. Justice Protik Prakash Banerjee, while hearing the appeal, had appointed advocate Phiroze Edulji amicus curiae to assist the court. 

On Friday, Edulji submitted before Justice Banerjee that the case involves substantial questions of law as the Constitution’s interpretation is involved. “In terms of Chapter II, Clause I, Second Proviso of the Calcutta High Court’s Appellate Side Rules, the case should be referred to a constitutional bench to decide such questions of law,” he said. 

Justice Banerjee agreed with Edulji’s argument and directed that the matter be placed before the Acting Ch-ief Justice for a Constitution bench to be set up. This is not the first time that the issue has come up before a high court. In 2013, the Gauhati High Court had struck down the resolution through which CBI was set up and held all its actions unconstitutional. The order was stayed by the Supreme Court, where the appeal is pending. 

Biswas was posted as telecom office assistant, Gr-I-cum-cashier at BSNL in Yogayog Bhawan when CBI started a probe against him. It claimed Biswas had entered into a criminal conspiracy with a private company and others to cheat BSNL. 

CBI filed a chargesheet against Biswas and four others, and on June 12, 2018, the special court sentenced all. Biswas was sentenced to seven years each and five years each under separate sets of IPC sections. The sentences were to run concurrently. He appealed against this order and questioned CBI’s constitutional validity.

Amit Shah vows NRC in Bengal after polls, lashes out at Mamata govt 

","
Alipurduar: BJP president Amit Shah made infiltration from neighbouring Bangladesh the focal point of his poll campaign and promised that the party would initiate the NRC (National Register of Citizens) exercise in West Bengal once the Narendra Modi government returned to office.

“Narendra Modi government will assume power again and we will bring NRC to Bengal. We will pick out each of the infiltrators and drive them out. The Hindu and Buddhist refugees need not leave the country. The Citizenship Amendment Bill is our commitment,” the BJP president said at a party gathering held at Alipurduar in north Bengal on Friday. Shah held that infiltrators couldn’t save the Mamata Banerjee government.

The BJP chief brought the NRC issue back in focus in a place bordering Assam in a bid to trigger a social churning in the region that has a substantial presence of migrants from Bangladesh. 

Shah has clearly changed the 2014 party narrative for Bengal and made a twin appeal to voters — vote Narendra Modi for the second time as leader of a “majbut” (strong) government at the Centre and uproot Banerjee’s party from the Bengal soil.

Shah further declared his party would get 23 seats from the state. He dared the Trinamool chief to marshal all “goondas” during elections. “Didi, your time is up. You are not going to win,” he said. 

The bitter anti-Banerjee rhetoric, however, was missing in BJP’s 2014 script. Party leaders had then urged people to replicate at the Centre the ‘poribartan’ they had brought about in Bengal in 2011.

But this time, the BJP president took Banerjee’s “Ma-Mati-Manush” slogan head on. “Ma se mamata chali gayi, Mati ghuspetiyo ko de diyi aur Manush himsa se bhaibheet ho gaya (Mothers have lost their motherly affection, the land has gone to infiltrators, and people of Bengal have come under a spell of violence). It is a question of survival for the people. Those who used to wake up with Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s nagarkirtan or Tagore’s songs now wake up to bomb blasts,” Shah said. He then paraphrased the theme, saying Banerjee’s party had spoilt the state’s rich heritage and culture, throttled democracy and damaged its judicial system.

In his bid to stoke growing public resentment against the informal “tola tax”, Shah made a mention of it. “You have to pay this special tax to Trinamool for all services — admission in schools and colleges, teaching jobs, getting names enrolled under MNREG scheme or a house under PMAY. These people won’t even spare applicants for widow pension. You all know how a senior Trinamool MP fell victim to the fledgling syndicates. It appears that communists were better than this regime,” he said.

The BJP chief scripted his speech with an eye on consolidating votes along religious lines. Alipurduar in north Bengal is a constituency that has a strong Adivasi presence, considerable Gorkha numbers in the tea gardens, settlers from former East Pakistan, and a substantial migrant population from Bangladesh. Till a decade ago, they voted on economic issues such as tea garden wages and development. 

“Just imagine the scene. You have to take permission for holding Durga Puja or Saraswati Puja. We have no problem if imams get monthly honorarium from government. But then why aren’t the pujaris getting it?” the BJP leader said. “The government is giving Urdu teacher in an Islampur school without a single Muslim student. Two students were killed in police firing because they wanted a teacher for Bengali,” he further said and added that the state government’s allocation for state madrassas was more than its higher education budget.

The BJP chief also took a dig at Banerjee over her stand against the Modi government’s stance on terror attacks in Pulwama and the subsequent airstrikes on Pakistan. “Mamata didi is very angry with the Modi government’s airstrikes against Pakistan. Let her be so, the Modi government won’t spare terrorists,” Shah said. He also referred to the CM’s criticism of the PM announcing the successful launch of an anti-satellite missile. “We don’t need to reap electoral benefits from such announcement. People of Bengal will work as missiles against you (Banerjee),” Shah said.

Kolkata: Two get life term for trafficking minor girl 

","
KOLKATA: A city court on Friday sentenced two persons to life imprisonment for trafficking a minor girl to Uttar Pradesh and forcing her to perform obscene dance in an orchestra. Additional district and sessions judge Lilamoy Mondal awarded the maximum sentence for the crime to two persons - one of whom trafficked her to Uttar Pradesh and the other who bought her and forced her to perform in the orchestra.


The charge of trafficking a minor girl results in a prison term of 10 years to life imprisonment and fine. 

The judge sentenced Rahul Ghosh and Suresh Gupta to life imprisonment and slapped a fine of Rs 10,000 on each, which if not paid will lead to another six months in jail for each of the two. 

The girl, who resided on the footpath at Shyambazar area in North Kolkata with her family, was offered to work in Uttar Pradesh by Ghosh. 

Taking advantage of her family's poverty, Ghosh got her to board a train to their destination, but suspecting something amiss, she tried to get off and return. 

She was, however, forced to go to Ramchandrapur, Deoria Sadar in Uttar Pradesh by Ghosh, who then sold her off to Gupta, owner of a dance bar there. 

The parents of the girl had filed a missing complaint at the Ultadanga police station in Kolkata. 

On receiving the information from a social worker that she was in the clutches of Gupta, the girl's parents went to Deoria Sadar to bring her back, but the orchestra owner threatened them at gun point. 

Police went to Deoria Sadar and rescued her on September 22, 2014, and arrested both the accused, public prosecutor Vivek Sharma said. 

Ghosh and Gupta were brought to Kolkata for trial. 

Following completion of the trial, during which the two accused were in judicial custody, the judge sentenced them to rigorous imprisonment for life for trafficking the girl. 

The two were also found guilty of wrongful confinement, for which they were sentenced to one year in prison. 

Both the punishments would run concurrently, the judge ordered.

It’s impossible in Mamata’s Bengal: TMC 

","
Kolkata: NRC is an impossibility in West Bengal while Mamata Banerjee is the chief minister, Trinamool Congress said on Friday in response to the BJP president’s assertion in this regard at an Alipurduar rally.

Trinamool secretary general Partha Chatterjee took on Amit Shah over his claim that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would drive out all infiltrators from Bengal once he returns to office. “The BJP national president should know that the Centre can’t initiate the NRC exercise on its own. The proposal has to come from the state. It is not possible as long as Mamata Banerjee is the chief minister of Bengal,” he said.

Trinamool leaders also mocked Shah’s claim that the saffron party would get 23 Lok Sabha seats from Bengal.

“The BJP president has no idea of Bengal and its people. He is making such wild guesstimates to charge up party ranks. I would rather present him a geography book on Bengal to study the contours of the state first before making projections. BJP won’t get a single seat from Bengal,” said Chatterjee.

Calling Shah an “encounter specialist”, state urban development minister Firhad Hakim said: “Amit Shah has no idea about Bengal politics. People of Bengal won’t give him a single Lok Sabha seat.”

MP IPS officer to watch over N Kolkata 

","
Kolkata: Assessing the sensitivity, the election commission is sending one police observer each for Kolkata North, Murshidabad, Raigunj, Ranaghat, Serampore and Asansol. The poll panel will also send 18 more police observers for the 36 remaining constituencies, taking the total number of police observers to 24 — the highest in recent times. The commission has also decided to send 44 expenditure observers and 47 general observers to the state, taking the total number of observers to 115. 

According to a senior poll panel official, this is highest number of police observers being sent to Bengal during elections in the recent past. In 2014 and 2016, the number of police observers sent to the state was 21 and 20 respectively. “In the last assembly poll, one observer was sent for each district and during the last Lok Sabha polls, one observer was responsible for two parliamentary constituencies,” a senior official said. 

According to another official, a senior level IPS officer from Madhya Pradesh has been given the responsibility of Kolkata North. “He will reach soon. He will be responsible not only for the deployment but will also make the final security design,” the official added. Kolkata North, with 1865 booths under 29 police stations, had recorded the lowest turnouts in the last two elections.

The commission has also made separate security design for this part of the city. According to a source, it has planned 32 naka points, including 7 bordering nakas, 29 quick response teams, 11 high radio flying squads (HRFS), 28 response teams (RT) and central forces for all the booths. In addition, there will be mobile patrolling vans and other static forces. “This huge deployment can be handled only by a senior IPS officer, who has been selected by the commission,” an official said.

Two senior IPS officers from Uttar Pradesh and one from Jharkhand have been given the responsibility of Raigunj, Serampore and Murshidabad, respectively. An IPS officer from Maharashtra and another from Uttarakhand will watch over Ranaghat and Asansol, respectively.

Ostler remained unrepentant for six years 

","
KOLKATA: He was arrested within hours of raping and murdering a two-and-a-half-year-old child but the RCTC ostler, Suresh Paswan, seemed unfazed by the heinous crime he had just committed. Paswan was not a history-sheeter but he acted like a hardened criminal, unperturbed and showing no remorse. “He confessed to his crime within a few days, but he was undaunted. He remained so all the six years the trial took to conclude,” a senior investigator said.





In the intervening night of July 20 and July 21, 2013 Paswan led the child away from the shanty she lived in with her grandmother below the Kidderpore ramp to Vidyasagar Setu, sexually assaulted her, throttled her and then, dumped her body in a drain off the northern gate of RCTC, a few metres from the shanty, police said. A city sessions court on Thursday sentenced the 41-year-old man to death.

Investigators said they had enough witnesses to testify Paswan had been trying to lure the child for some time. Even the day before the rape and murder, he was seen offering her a toffee. So, the night Paswan picked her up from the shanty, where she was sleeping, the girl did not raise an alarm, police said. After sexually torturing the girl and killing her, Paswan walked back to his ostlers’ quarters, near the victim’s shanty. By then, the child’s grandmother and neighbours had started hunting for her. When they spotted Paswan, they asked him if he had seen the girl, but he denied it. After the girl’s body was found in the drain near RCTC, locals told cops Paswan was seen walking from that direction and he had mud on his feet. He was rounded up and he confessed. 

The biggest challenge for the investigators, led by officer Chinmay Banerjee and the prosecuting team, led by public prosecutor Tamal Mukherjee, was not during the probe but during the trial. Among the 33 witnesses, several were pavement dwellers and rag-pickers, who had no fixed address. Among those who testified in court was a 13-year-old girl who begged near Victoria Memorial for a living. It was she, who had first seen the child lying motionless in an open drain. “This case was built around circumstantial evidence and forensic reports,” an investigator said. “As there was no witness to the crime being actually committed, the chain of events leading to the crime and immediately after had to be proved beyond doubt in court. Since the witnesses had no fixed addresses, it was difficult to serve them court summons through the Hastings police station. But still, several of them testified in court,” an officer said. Mukherjee and his legal team, comprising additional public prosecutor Atanu Banerjee among others, also had to track the case on a day-to-day basis. 

A resident of Bihar, Paswan lost his parents at a very young age and was brought up by his maternal uncle, police said. For a long time, they lived in Bangalore, where his uncle worked as an ostler and Paswan assisted him. In March 2013, they shifted to Kolkata, where his uncle worked at RCTC. “The horse’s trainer had testified in court,” an investigator said. “Even his uncle, who helped us track him down, could not shed any light on Paswan’s deviant and criminal side,” an investigator said. TOI could not trace the uncle on Thursday after the verdict.

Kolkata: Mentally challenged woman raped by acquaintance 

","


KOLKATA: A 43-year-old mentally challenged woman returning home from a kirtan at Rajarhat in north 24 parganas was allegedly raped by an acquaintance from a neighbouring village, who had offered to escort her safely to her home from the akhara early on Friday.



The woman had returned home around 2am but didn’t confine anything to her family members till she began feeling uneasy on Friday morning and had started vomiting blood. On being questioned by her family members, she told her sister about the assault, who immediately took her to the police station and registered a complaint. The woman could name her tormentor and he was subsequently arrested from his home on Friday.

Identified as Kanai Naskar (46), the tormentor was produced before a district court and was remanded to police custody.

The incident happened at Panchanandatala near Vedic Village in Rajarhat. Police said, the woman, a resident of Sikharpur village had gone to attend a kirtan at Arbelia, around a km from her home. “She was returning home alone a little after midnight when the accused man, whom the victim knew from before. The man had offered to walk her towards her home as it had been very late. However when they reached a desolate place near Panchanandatala, the man forcibly took her behind a bush and raped her,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate.

After the assault, the man had allegedly threatened the woman to not to tell about the incident to anyone and fled back to his own home.

Probing into the complaint, police reached his house on Friday and learning that he was at a local vegetable market, rushed there, and picked him up from the market. Police said, Naskar sells vegetables at the local market and had gone to attend the kirtan with a group of friends on Thursday night.

No claimants for 200 lockers at Vardaan 

","
KOLKATA: Contents of at least 200 lockers in the basement of Vardaan market, where the income tax department had conducted raids for over a month, remain unclaimed. In one of the longest raids in recent times, the department has so far seized more than Rs 5 crore and jewellery worth Rs 13.6 crore.





The department began raids into a total of 649 lockers at Vardaan market after issuing warrants to search the premises, which included around 2,000 lockers in a vault. Since the warrant was for the entire premises, the department decided to temporarily attach the lockers as the locker management company allegedly failed to provide any document or permission to run a private vault.

While many of the lockers remained unused, holders of 649 lockers were issued notices under Section 131 of the Income Tax Act. Each of them was asked to produce documents for holding and operating the lockers and explain how s/he acquired the wealth. Almost 450 locker holders turned up with the necessary documents, but around 200 did not. According to I-T department officials, some of the addresses registered with the locker management company were found to be fake. The private company, which has been running the vault services on the premises since 1985, claimed that the lockers were rented out.

“The warrant was for searching the premises and primary responsibility of the contents belonged to the company or the owner. When he denied owning the lockers, notices were issued to locker holders,” said an I-T official.

“The searches were part of our drive against black money,” principal commissioner (investigation) Ashish Verma said. Officials indicated that there were several such private vaults in the city that did not have the necessary permissions.

Kolkata: Work to boost runway capacity to start in April 

","
KOLKATA: The city airport is set to augment the standby runway capacity to eliminate flight delays and diversions when the main runway is shut. The Rs 311-crore project will allow at least 30 flights to fly in and out of Kolkata every hour when only the secondary runway is in operation. At present, the secondary runway can handle 15 flights an hour. 





“We will award the work for extension of F-taxi track in April. The taxi track will first connect to the northern end of the secondary runway and then continue to connect the northern end of the primary runway. Once the project is completed in a couple of years, the secondary runway will be able to handle as many flights as the primary runway. This will be a huge help as now, flights have to be kept on hold and even diverted to other airports when the primary runway is shut for routine maintenance or during exigencies,” Kolkata airport director Kaushik Bhattacharya said. 

Tenders for the air-side capacity enhancement were floated in October 2018. After the project is awarded in April, it has to be completed in 30 months or by October 2021. The benefit will be felt from 2022 summer when planes can land from the northern side and take off from the southern end. 

Though the number of flights operating at Kolkata airport has soared in the past seven years from around 250 a day in 2012 to over 450 now, and passenger count has increased from 10 million to 19 million over the period, the runway capacity remains constrained. While the primary runway capacity has been enhanced to 35 from 30 flights an hour, that of secondary runway has remained 15 an hour due to the alignment of taxi track A that increases the runway occupancy time of departing flights. 

The 2,790m secondary runway is long enough to handle the aircraft that the airlines operate to Kolkata. But as the existing taxi track joins the runway around 600m from the end, planes have to travel the distance on the runway and then make a U-turn for the take-off run. This keeps the runway needlessly engaged for an additional two minutes per flight. Once the new taxi track is ready, flights can start the take-off run immediately after entering the runway. This will save the two crucial minutes per flight. 

“When the secondary runway is operational, the minimum gap between two flights is four minutes. Our endeavour is to reduce this gap so that more flights can be packed in an hour. Once taxi track F is extended to the end of the runway, it will potentially double the runway capacity,” said Airports Authority of India regional executive director (east) S P Yadav. The revised capacity will be, however, notified only after a safety assessment. 

Also, taxi track A is so close to the secondary runway that planes cannot begin taxiing for departure if another flight is scheduled to arrive or take off from the secondary runway. Once taxi track F is extended and used by aircraft taxiing for take-off, it will not hinder operations on the secondary runway as the distance between the two will be adequate.

Golaghata, Sree Bhumi footbridges shut down 

","
Kolkata: The state public works department (PWD) on Friday shut down two foot over-bridges at Sree Bhumi and Golaghata crossings on VIP Road and they will be dismantled soon.

The state officials said the reason for closing down the foot bridges was that subways had been constructed at both the crossings and people had been using them more to cross to the Salt Lake side. “The two subways on VIP Road were inaugurated just before the Pujas last year. Ever since, most people have been using the underpasses and not the footbridges,” said a PWD official.

The footbridges were built some years ago to help commuters cross VIP Road but the authorities later noticed very few actually used those facilties as it involved climbing stairs. So, they later came up with the plan for subways.

IMA bid to help Centre in TB fight 

","
KOLKATA: Indian Medical Association (IMA) has come forward to help the Centre in eliminating tuberculosis (TB) by 2025. One of the biggest challenges in keeping track and monitoring TB treatment, a source said, is thata large number of private practitioners fail to notify cases.


“IMA has over four lakh doctors across the country. We will be actively participating in this initiative to eliminate TB,” said Santanu Sen, IMA national president. In 2018, the number of TB cases reported in West Bengal stood at 1,00,300. More than 86% of them were notified from government healthcare facilities.“Only about 14,600 cases were reported by private practitioners,” said B K Saha, state TB officer. IMA has been mobilising doctors, holding awareness progammes, so that doctors from the private healthcare sector do not fail to notify a single case.

Kolkata cops to check background of vehicles with ‘police’ sticker 

","
KOLKATA: All 25 traffic guards across the city have been instructed to stop any car or bike with ‘police’ sticker to verify whether it actually belongs to a cop or not. 





“If it’s found that anyone using the sticker is not a cop, sergeants will pursue the matter with local police station and a case of criminal impersonation will be lodged. The vehicle can also even be confiscated,” said an officer.

An order was issued to all guards late on Thursday evening, instructing them to prepare and maintain a list of policemen using two-wheelers and four-wheelers with police stickers.

“We have drawn up a schedule on how we are going to go about the job. With elections round the corner, we will not allow any biker or motorist to flaunt police sticker to bypass rules or avoid prosecution for flouting norms,” said an officer from a north Kolkata traffic guard.

Several individuals outside the police force use such stickers or put temporary boards with the word ‘police’ written on it as a licence to violate traffic rules and avoid paying toll.

“Some use the sticker to impersonate as cops and fleece unsuspecting motorists who have jumped a signal or violated some other traffic rule,” claimed an officer. 

The stickers are easily available in the market and can be purchased for Rs 10 to Rs 15. 

City lawyers said the Motor Vehicles Act is silent on use of such stickers but cops can start cases under the Indian Penal Code if those are misused.

“There is a security threat too and there have been a number of representations in courts earlier to protest against the use of such stickers,” said lawyer Badal Sen Chowdhury. He also said that cops can book cases against motorists if the stickers obstruct the view of the road and of the interior of the vehicle.

Poultry deaths in districts hit supply in Kolkata, jack up dressed chicken prices 

","
KOLKATA: Several districts in south and central Bengal have reported widespread poultry deaths over the past few days that have resulted in a sharp drop in the supply of chicken to Kolkata markets and triggered a price rise.





Dressed chicken, which was being sold at Rs 150-Rs 180 a kg 20 days ago, sold at Rs 210-Rs 250 a kg on Friday. Poultry owners and traders have blamed the sudden and rapid fluctuation in temperature for the deaths and the situation, they added, is not likely to improve unless there is a change in weather conditions.

“I have never seen a situation like this before,” Pratap Ghosh, secretary, West Bengal Poultry Traders Association told TOI. “The mortality in most of the poultry farms across Hooghly and Midnapore is almost 100% and traders face a crisis. It is certainly a virus attack but we cannot ascertain whether it is bird flu that has hit the farms,” Ghosh added.

However, West Bengal Poultry Federation (WBPF) general secretary Madan Mohan Maity put the blame squarely on the vagaries of nature. “Flowers like Land Lotus have started blooming now, something I have never seen. The Land Lotus blooms in autumn. We don’t know whether it is global warming but our trade has been hit badly by the weather.”

Hooghly and Midnapore districts are the two biggest broiler chicken suppliers to Kolkata — by far the biggest chicken-consuming district in the state. “My entire poultry production has been wiped out in 15 days and no medicine or vaccine could save a single chick,” said Babusona Roy of Dighirpar in Hooghly. Malay Nandi of Goghat in Hooghly has been luckier. He could save just about 20% of his stock, which he sold under distress.

West Bengal Poultry Federation is peeved at the gap between the retail price they have announced and the price at which dressed chicken is being sold in Kolkata markets. “A large number of retailers charge customers unfairly when chickens die in poultry farms and the supply is hit. On Friday, WBPF has fixed the price of dressed chicken at Rs 190. So, retailers should not sell chicken beyond Rs 200 a kg. But a lot of traders are selling chicken at a higher margin,” said Maity.

Retailer Bibhuti Shaw sold chicken at Rs 250 per kg at Lake Market on Friday. “The supply of chicken is now less than 25 per cent of what used to be three weeks ago. Moreover, chickens are dying in our cages as well. The loss is thus piling up. We cannot sell chicken at a lower price,” he said.

Pintu Bhattacharya, a senior manager of one of the two major chick supplying agencies said, “The crisis is largely because of poultry operators not following the protocols for raising the chicks. This is the time when even a slight negligence can lead to high mortality in the farms.”

“The government sells chicken at Rs 140 per kg at Haringhata. This is the government fixed retail price. But private hatcheries keep jacking up price on any pretext. We have received no complaint of chicken mortality across Bengal,” said Swapan Debnath, minister of the state, animal resources development.

Couple, two daughters die in fire, suicide pact suspected 

","
HOOGHLY: In an apparent “suicide pact” a couple burnt their two minor daughters alive and set themselves ablaze in Hooghly’s Chinsurah on Wednesday night.

Surat Ali (42), his wife Rajina Bibi (36) and their daughters Afrin Yasmin (13) and Asiyana Khatun (6) were declared dead at Chinsurah Imambara Hospital.

Officers of the Chandernagore Commissionerate said prima facie it appeared to be a case of a suicide pact, several neighbours claimed that there were frequent fights between Surat and his wife. Surat was a peasant and owned some land and a one-storey house in Chandanpur. Police also claimed that he was a mental patient and under treatment.

“Prima facie, it appears to be a suicide pact. We are trying to figure out what led the family to take such a drastic step. The family was not facing any financial problem,” said Akhilesh Chaturvedi, the commissioner of Chandernagore Commissionerate.

Charred bodies of all the four members were found lying on a bed. An officer of Chinsurah police station said both Surat and Rajina decided to kill themselves and they set the daughters afire before setting themselves ablaze.

“It does not appear to be a case of accident, because only the bodies got burnt and rest of the room was not affected. Had it been an accident, the room would have been gutted as well,” said the officer.

The neighbours said that they overheard the husband and the wife quarrelling on Wednesday evening too. “There would be regular quarrels between the husband and the wife. Many of us heard them fight even on Wednesday evening. It seems a little strange that they would get into a suicide pact,” said Akbar Ali, a neighbour of Surat.

Medical student leaps to death 

","
KOLKATA: A second-year MBBS student of Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College & Hospital (NRSMCH) reportedly leapt to death from the terrace of a building in Beliaghata on Wednesday night. 

The deceased, Subhojit Majhi (22), was apparently unable to cope with his studies. According to sources, he could not clear his second-year exams and, hence, lost an academic year. He was depressed over this.

Around 8.40pm on Wednesday, Majhi went up to the terrace of P-34, CIT Road, and took the fatal leap from the five-storied building. He was rushed to NRSMCH where he died around 11.30pm at the critical care unit. Police recovered a note where Majhi had reportedly jotted down a few lines, stating no one was to be blamed for his suicide.

“He was a student of the college, but he was not a boarder. He used to live with his family in Beliaghata,” said Dr Dwaipayan Biswas, deputy medical superintendent at NRSMCH.

His family told police that he was upset as he was unable to cope with his studies. Hailing from Burdwan, his mother and sister-in-law lived with him at the CIT Road house.

According to students at the college, Majhi remained aloof and did not make too many friends.

Kolkata: Futnani Chambers gets prop-up touches 

","
KOLKATA: Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), the implementing agency of East-West Metro, and ITD ITD-Cem, the construction company building the tunnels, have started taking mitigation measures inside Futnani Chambers though there’s still some time left for the tunnel-boring machines (TBMs) to pass this stretch of SN Banerjee Road. According to a KMRC survey, Futnani Chambers is the most ‘unsafe’ among 86 critical buildings standing along the Metro alignment between SN Banerjee Road and Raja Subodh Mullick Square.





TBM Chandi has just started burrowing near the SN Banerjee Road-JL Nehru Road crossing. Seven wobbly structures in the first 200m — till Regal Cinema — are also being strengthened. Among them, two buildings have already been evacuated. It won’t be until April-end that the TBM, building 10m-15m a day, reaches Futnani Chambers, after crossing the civic headquarters.

“But since this ‘mini-township’ on 6A SN Banerjee Road tops the list of unsafe buildings, extensive strengthening is needed to prepare the crumbling structure for the TBMs’ approach a month later,” said an engineer.

Futnani Chambers, which sprawls over 100 cottahs, is home to the Bata outlet for decades, apart from Aminia and Raunak hotel. The building was once home to the well-known nightclub, Golden Slipper. 

Officials said tonnes of steel and truckloads of cement will be needed to strengthen the structure. ITD ITD-Cem has started preparing the list of people to be evacuated. Only those occupants who reside here — around 150 in number — will be offered hotel stay. All of them will move out a week prior to the TBMs’ scheduled arrival and will have to stay out of the premises for at least 10 days. The business establishments will also remain shut during this period.

Over the next few days, the entire ground floor, where most people live, will be fitted with steel props to support the walls and ceilings inside. Tilt metres will be placed at various corners of the building for monitoring the slightest displacement. Extensive grouting will be done as well. “Grout is a mixture of water, cement and sand, which will be injected into the concrete base of the structure so that the upheaval caused by the TBMs’ movement doesn’t inflict any harm,” explained an engineer.

“We have made elaborate reinforcing plans, which includes pre-grouting, pre-repairing, providing temporary scaffolding and steel props and grouting for strengthening the foundation. All these will be done and cracks will be repaired before and after the TBMs pass,” he said.

Civic focus on Cossipore pipe breach 

","
KOLKATA: After managing to fix two valves in a water pipe under Chittaranjan Avenue that had breached last Saturday, Kolkata Municipal Corporation is now focusing on repairing a major leak that has developed in a 60-inch water pipe near R G Kar Hospital off Cossipore railway tracks. The pipe was laid 35 years ago and carries filtered water from Tallah water reservoir to Auckland Square in central Kolkata and caters to large swathes of north and central Kolkata.

KMC water supply department admitted the task of accessing the pipe 40 feet below the surface won’t be easy. Engineers plan to first reach a brick sewer that runs parallel to the pipe and access the breach through it. “The repair gang needs to be precise. They must reach the exact point on time and do the repair within hours so that the job is done before supply resumes,” said a KMC official. KMC has already announced a supply shutdown between 9.30am on Saturday and 5.30am on Sunday. Initially, the shutdown was for removing a section of redundant pipe at Wellington for the construction of an East West Metro ventilation cum evacuation shaft. The civic authority plans to now utilize the opportunity to plug the breach at Cossipore as well.

Coin exhibition to trace footsteps of Jesus 

","
Kolkata: Winds of change are blowing over this 232-year-old church, tucked in one corner of Dalhousie, diagonally opposite Raj Bhavan. St John’s Church, which was the first cathedral the British built in the country and was the only cathedral till St Paul’s was built, is being thrown open to public programmes. 

The church will start with an exhibition of coins on Sunday evening with some coins going back to 2,500 years, to trace the footprints of Jesus. The church has tied up with the Numismatic Society of India for this and well- known collectors have offered to showcase their collection on March 31. While the focus of the exhibition will be “Tracing the Footsteps of Jesus”, coins from the Mauryan, Kushana and Gupta era will also be showcased. Numismatists said this is the first time that coins related to Jesus are being exhibited in India.

The oldest coin on display will be the one that was issued between 519 BC to 465 BC, during the reign of Xerxes, the fifth king of the Achaemenid dynasty of Persia. The coin is relevant because he has been mentioned as Ahasuerus in the Book of Esther of the Old Testament and is hence the starting point of the Jesus story of the exhibition, explained collector Brian Grey. 

 Among the other valuable coins that will be on display are the ones dating back to 340 BC, from the time of Alexander, one from the time of Julius Caesar (34 BC) and some that were issued by Tiberius Caesar between 14 AD and 34 AD. “One such coin Jesus held in his hand while uttering that famous line, ‘Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s; and to God the things that are God’s,” Grey said. Collectors Ujjwal Saha, and Souvik Majumdar will be displaying Indian coins from the Kushana, Maurya and Gupta dynasties. 

Bishop Probal Dutta said, “Last year I did the same thing with St Paul’s, and the city saw some of the finest concerts happen inside the church. We want people from all faiths to frequent St John’s Church and make it a happening venue,” Dutta said.

Priest of the church, Arghyo Biswas, said, “We are ready to provide the venue for the cause of any socially relevant issue.”

West Bengal tops in rural job scheme, Gujarat trails 

","
KOLKATA: West Bengal has become the best performing state both in MGNREGA, according to data recently shared by the minister of state for rural development Ram Kripal in Rajya Sabha.


Kripal who was replying to a question asked by TMC MP Manas Bhunia said that the ranking is both in terms of allotting jobs and utilising funds under the central scheme.

West Bengal has bagged the top spot in MGNREGA for the third time in a row. 

According to the data, the state topped the list for generating over 77% work so far. Andhra Pradesh occupied the second spot with 55.92% work and Madhya Pradesh was at the third spot with 51.27%. 

Other states like, Tamil Nadu (44.48%), Maharashtra (46.23%), Uttar Pradesh (41.57%), Jharkhand (41.66%) Karnataka (48.95%) and Gujarat completed 45.07% of work under the scheme.

Even the northeastern states of the country have performed well under MGNREGA.

The TMC has pointed out the 'not impressive' performance of the BJP-ruled states. The party has recently released their manifesto for Loksabha 2019, where they have assured the voters to replicate its government's success stories in West Bengal at the national level.

Kolkata students take YouTube lessons to steal bikes 

","
By: Mayukh Sengupta

KOLKATA: Bidhannagar Police on Wednesday busted a gang of young bike thieves in the Baguiati area. The gang of students and dropouts had apparently learnt the art of starting a bike without a key by watching YouTube videos. 

According to officers of Baguiati PS, who have so far arrested two 19-year-old youths — Aditya Gupta and Ajay Mallick — and detained five boys aged between 14 and 17, said the gang members used to refer to online videos to learn the process of starting a bike by tampering the ignition wires of self-start bikes. After the theft, the group used to park the two-wheelers at houses belonging to their friends and relatives and sell them off as and when potential buyers were available. So far, cops have recovered two stolen bikes and are on the lookout for other gang members. 

“Apparently, the group had stolen around 10 motorbikes from Baguati, Jyanagar and Hatiara. We will interrogate the arrested duo to know where they have kept the other motorbikes,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate.

Gupta and Mallick are brains behind the gang. Gupta is a first-year BCom student and Mallick is a school dropout, police said. 

“The two said they began stealing bikes to fund their flashy lifestyle,” said an officer. Both were produced at a Barasat court on Thursday and remanded in 10-day police custody.

Half of Kolkata taps to go dry on Saturday as KMC starts work on water pipes 

","
KOLKATA: It will be a busy Saturday for the water supply department of Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) as it takes up the daunting task of going 40ft below the surface to repair a pipe leak in north Kolkata. Around the same time, in central Kolkata, another team will handle another delicate assignment of digging out a Raj-era pipe at Wellington Square without breaching other utility lines running close to it. 





KMC has formed a 50-member team to repair the 60-inch pipe, which supplies filtered water to large areas of north and central Kolkata. The pipe that originates at Tallah water reservoir runs below the Cossipore rail tracks and parallel to a brick sewer line till it connects Auckland water booster pumping station in central Kolkata. So apart from catering to large areas of north and central Kolkata, the pipe also plays a vital role in supplying potable water to several south Kolkata localities, including Lansdowne, Bhowanipore, Rashbehari Avenue, Park Circus, Ballygunge and Gariahat Road.

A section of KMC water supply department officials on Friday made a survey of the area (Nilmoni Mitra Road near RG Kar Hospital) before planning the repair work. “This is not an ordinary repair work. The 60-inch connector is a major pipe where the pressure of water — even after switching off Palta-Tallah water lines — may cause accidents if the workers try to do anything in haste,” said a KMC official.

According to plans, the KMC team of engineers will make a final survey of the pipe after closing the water treatment plant at Palta, which produces 40 million gallon water everyday. Then a team of workers will be engaged in ‘de-watering’ the main pipe. “We will take up the de-watering process from five pressure points. This process will take at least two to three hours. Once this process is over, we will go to the next step,” said the civic official.

The next course of action, according to a KMC water supply department official, will be to press into service five heavy-duty pumps to suck the remaining water from the pipe. “Only then will we be able to enter the pipeline,” said a KMC official. A group of KMC workers will then go 40ft down a manhole specially created for the KMC team and start repairing the spot. We need to exercise extreme caution during the repair process. All we need to do is a precision wielding job. Since the 60-inch pipe is built of mild steel, wielding is the best method to repair the leaks,” said a KMC water supply department official.

The second job — removal of a defunct century-old pipe — will start simultaneously at 9.30am at Wellington Square. A separate team of KMC engineers and workers will be present at this site to wind up the job by 3pm. The KMC team needs to remove the defunct pipe to facilitate construction of a ventilation shaft and an emergency exit gate for East-West Metro.

Vellore seaman dies in drill, family members shattered 

","
CHENNAI: Seaman Mohan Raj, attached to the Indian Navy, bid farewell to his family and friends on February 26 before reporting back for duty. It was the last holiday that the 21-year-old was to have in his native village in Tamil Nadu. 


A phone call at 5pm on Thursday conveyed the shocking news of Mohan Raj's death to his family and Machanur village in Vellore district plunged into gloom. ""Raj's mother Valliamma attended the phone call. Without much of an explanation, the caller told her he wanted to talk to some male member of the family,"" said Raj's cousin L Gokul. 

Valliammal, who was petrified and puzzled over the call, handed the phone to her son-in-law Premkumar. The caller told him that Raj sustained injuries during a combat weapon firing drill and died. The incident took place at 11am on Thursday. ""We could not believe it. We repeatedly tried the (phone) number to get a clear picture of what exactly happened to him. But we are in the dark,"" he said. Mohan Raj's body would be airlifted to INS Rajali in Arakkonam and brought to his village by road by Saturday evening. The villagers were making arrangements to give him a fitting farewell. He would be laid to rest in his village, said Gokul. Rajagopal and Valliamma, both daily wage labourers, were inconsolable. Raj's younger brother and sister Pavithra were disconsolate, said his relatives.

After Raj joined the Navy three years ago, the family was able to make ends meet and got his sister Pavithra married. They moved out of their native village and built a tiled roof house in Velampattu in the hope of a better future. ""Life has come to a standstill for the family,"" Gokul said, breaking down.

Raj was popular among family and friends and would make time to meet everyone whenever he came home on leave. ""Before leaving to rejoin duty, he would meet elders to seek their blessings. He was humble and fun-loving ,"" recalled Gokul.

Two workers die as wall of chemical-filled tank collapses 

","
CHENNAI: Two people, including a teenager, who were involved in cleaning a tank at a tannery at Pallavaram, died following a wall collapse on Thursday night.


Police said Akram Ansari, 17, Abith Hussain, 24 and Ajay, 25, from Jharkhand were working in a tannery on Kannayiram Street in Pammal near Pallavaram.

On Thursday night, while they were cleaning a tank where chemicals are stored to wash leather, a side wall of the tank fell on them, police said. Hearing a loud noise, other employees of the tannery rushed to the scene and pulled the three out.

While Akram died on the spot, Hussain and Ajay were taken to Chromepet Government Hospital.

On Friday morning, Hussain was shifted to Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital where he died of cardiac arrest. 

Quoting doctors, police said Hussain developed uneasiness as he might have consumed some of the chemicals he fell in. “He was unable to get the debris off him and was struggling to get out till his fellow workers came to his rescue,” said an investigating officer.

The Shankar Nagar police registered a case of accidental death and further investigations are on.

Police are questioning the owner of the tannery to find out if the three had put on their safety gears. 

Sources said the structure of the tank in use for more than a decade was already weak.

The condition of Ajay is critical, doctors said.

'With folded hands', Madras HC appeals to motorists to drive carefully 

","
CHENNAI: Deeply moved by a case in which the father of a girl was killed in a road accident when she was still in the womb of her mother, Madras high court appealed with 'folded hands' to motorists to be careful while driving, as not only their lives but that of other innocent people on the road were in their hands. 


""This case should be an eye-opener for vehicle drivers to drive at a normal speed, and follow road rules and regulations. Any violation of road rules like drunken driving, reckless driving and speaking over mobile phone while driving would not only cause death or injuries to third parties, but also cause injuries or death to the driver. The drivers should understand that they are capable of causing death or injury to others due to their rash and negligent driving,"" a division bench of Justices N Kirubakaran and R Pongiappan said on Friday.

The bench made the observation on an appeal moved by Oriental Insurance Company Limited challenging the quantum of compensation awarded to dependants of Ragu, who was killed in a road accident on December 10, 2012.

Rejecting the appeal by the insurer, the court enhanced the award from 18.88 lakh to 25.30 lakh. 

Empathising with the daughter of the deceased, the bench said, ""Is it a sin to be born as daughter to a woman, who lost her husband in a road traffic accident, due to the negligence of a third party? Given the conservative nature of our society, the answer is in the affirmative, as the girl, who was an unborn child at the time of the accident, could not even see her father's face. He passed away when she was in her mother's womb, thereby casting a stigma on her, even before her arrival in this world."" The girl was not only born fatherless, but with a stigma that she, in a way, was responsible for her father's death, as our conservative society would always try to find a scapegoat to fix the blame for an ill-fated tragedy that happened in the life of someone, the judges observed.

Chennai: Final closure for a crime of passion with few parallels 

","
CHENNAI: Love, deceit, black magic, crime and punishment – the Prince Santhakumar murder case, which has ruined the lives of many people, has everything in full measure. The Supreme Court verdict on Friday upholding life imprisonment for P Rajagopal, owner of Saravana Bhavan chain of hotels, turned out to be a fitting climax for a 17-year-old crime of passion that few would forget.


When she ‘escaped’ from the custody of Rajagopal’s men and lodged a kidnap complaint on January 31, 2001, Jeevajothi would not have dreamt that it would turn out to be one of such a sensational case. In her complaint she suspected that Rajagopal and his men might have kidnapped her husband Prince Santhakumar.

The then inspector of police B Sivasankaran, who took over probe from the then Velachery inspector S Deivasigamani, reminisced the sequence of events, and told TOI how Jeevajothi’s family comprising herself, her parents and brother Ramkumar had migrated from Thothakudi in Vedaranyam and how her father Ramasamy became ‘Saravana Bhavan’ Rajagopal’s employee.




Shanthakumar entered the scene as tuition teacher for Ramkumar, and soon thereafter Jeevajothi fell in love with him. First, they eloped to Madurai but were traced by men engaged by Rajagopal. “The hotelier started wooing Jeevajothi after astrologer Ravi of Madipakkam told him that he would become one of the richest people in the world if he married Jeevajothi. Rajagopal went to the extent of engaging a black magician to make Jeevajothi to hate Shanthakumar. He also set his men upon Santhakumar and tried to scare him out of Jeevajothi’s life.

But, Shanthakumar returned after a while and planned to elope with Jeevajothi to some unknown destination and settle there.

Rajagopal, however, took them to a temple in Tirunelveli, where he offered them a room in a lodge. From there, Rajagopal kidnapped Shanthakumar and got him murdered. His body was dumped in Tiger Shola in Kodaikanal hills, Sivasankaran said.

The officer further told TOI that Rajagopal asked Jeevajothi to forget Santhakumar, as he had turned lunatic and disappeared. He kept her in his custody in KK Nagar till she escaped to Vedaranyam before lodging a formal complaint of kidnap with Velachery police. “It was the starting point of the entire case,” said Sivasankaran.

The investigation officers weaved an air-tight case against Rajagopal utilising damning statements, evidence and recovery of things, including Santhakumar’s body. Though in 2004 a special court in Poonamallee awarded 10-yar imprisonment to Rajagopal and others, it was the then judge of Madras high court, Justice S Banumathi (now a judge in the Supreme Court), who enhanced it to one of life imprisonment in 2009.

Customs officials seize 18 tonnes of red sanders worth Rs 9 crore 

","
CHENNAI: The Chennai seaport Customs seized 18 tonnes of red sanders worth Rs 9 crore and cracked an operation which revealed misdeclaration of the wood as car accessories, a fake RC book of the truck that was used to ferry the goods and a fake address given by a tenant who had rented a godown to store the red sanders under the pretext of storing chemicals.


The 40-day investigation culminated on Wednesday night when Customs officials located a godown in Kundrathur. Sources said the situation was tense as the villagers thought it was a raid before the election. “The godown was in a secluded place near a crematorium. Hence, it was difficult to locate,” said a senior official privy to the operation.

The operation started in the third week of February when officials, on a preventive check at Kattupalli port, noticed a container truck parked outside the entry gate. The driver had escaped after he became aware of the checks.

The container had 11.16 metric tonnes of red sanders worth Rs 5.57 crore. The goods were declared as car accessories and parts, and were meant for export to Jebel Ali Port in Dubai. The shipping bill was also forged, officials said. The truck registration number did not match the RC book found inside the vehicle. “The truck has been sold and resold many times,” an official said.

Customs found that the shipping liner had not verified the KYC documents of the exporter before processing the documents. The staff of the liner has been arrested, an official said.

In a follow up action, the Customs officials zeroed in on the secluded godown where the goods were loaded, near Kundrathur. Inside the godown, goods were kept under tarpaulin and husk sacks. Around 7.34 metric tonnes of red sanders worth Rs 3.6 crore was recovered.

The godown owner told Customs that the vacant land was leased out to a person from Kancheepuram who had constructed the shed. But the address given in the lease agreement was found to be fake, Customs said.

Red sanders are classified as endangered under IUCN Red list.

Lights out, noise off to bring autism awareness into focus 

","
CHENNAI: Many people shop to de-stress, but for people with autism and their families, a visit to the local mall can be stressful. For people who are sensitive to sounds and bright light, browsing through stores results in a sensory overload.


That’s why, on April 1, ahead of World Autism Awareness Day (observed on April 2), Big Bazaar outlets in 16 cities, including Chennai, will observe a ‘Quiet Hour’ from 11am to 1pm. During this time, lights in the store will be dimmed, and announcements, music, and other loud sounds cut out, so that individuals with autism and their families have a relaxing conducive environment to shop in.

“The initiative is being conducted for the first time and we have been also holding workshops to sensitise staff members,” says Sharada Rajaram, coordinator, We Can, a resource centre working with children with autism. “The idea is to create a conducive environment for these families and also create awareness about autism.

The campaign kicked off in December, when Big Bazaar tied up with Mumbai-based NGO Sol’s Arc. “They wanted to see how their stores can be made sensory-friendly for World Disability Day, December 3, 2018,” says Poonam Nair, vocational head, Sol’s Arc. After a four-month study, they came up with suggestions – dim lights, no loud noise or announcements, visual signage and engagement zones. “Even noise from the trolleys and scanning machines were cut out. Since, people with autistism are visual learners, we came up with appropriate visual codes. Engagement zones with fun activities were created so shoppers could relax and seating arrangements were made in the store so they could sit when tired.” 

Employees were also sensitized to assist shoppers in a sensitive manner.

On April 1, the same arrangements will be put in place in all 16 stores. “We have invited NGOs in various cities to bring in families to experience this. Based on the feedback we get, we plan to make it permanent across these stores, with one quiet hour a week,” says Nair, adding that the initiative has been spearheaded by Sonali Saini, founder-chairperson of Sol’s Arc.

On April 1 and 2, Ripon Building as well as Lanson Toyota showrooms, Madras Race Club in Guindy, Mecheri Centre at Eldams Road, and Shuttles & Needles at Indra Nagar will be lit up in blue for autism awareness.

AMMK makes Perambur bypoll a triangular fight 

","
CHENNAI: Almost lost in the hullabaloo of the Lok Sabha elections are the byelections to 18 Assembly constituencies, on which rests the fate of the AIADMK government. Among them is the bypoll in Chennai’s Perambur, represented by P Vetrivel, one of the disqualified legislators and supporter of AMMK deputy secretary T T V Dhinakaran.


After Dhinakaran won the neighbouring RK Nagar seat in the 2017 byelection, AMMK, having fielded Vetrivel, has made it a triangular fight in Perambur, where the DMK has nominated R D Shekar and the AIADMK R S Raajesh.

Residents say the constituency has been languishing without infrastructure, in contrast to the nearby Kolathur Assembly constituency, represented by DMK leader M K Stalin, getting much attention and development. Perambur, which is known as a sports-friendly neighbourhood, doesn’t have much to boast of today. “Our neighbourhood has produced many football players. Today’s children have no avenue to develop their sporting skills,” said N Deepak, a resident of Vyasarpadi who works for Swiggy.

The neighbourhood, many said, is far from healthy, what with the Kodungaiyur dump yard polluting the air and water. Candidates here hear a lot of complaints about lack of drinking water. A resident of MKB Nagar says people here have almost retired to their fate. “We have no MLA or councillor to take up our issues,” said a senior citizen who did not wish to be named. “So, citizens here try to address their own issues.” The retired government employee adds that MTC bus services to Perambur have not improved despite the population going up considerably.

Perambur is one of the two constituencies in north Chennai that the AIADMK won in the 2016 Assembly elections (J Jayalalithaa won in RK Nagar). Tell Vetrivel about residents’ woes, and he counters: “I have used my MLA funds to construct a culvert to link the southern side of the constituency to a burial ground at Kodungaiyur. “If re-elected, I will work to bring down the size of Kodungaiyur dump yard and arrest pollution,” he said.

But complaints still galore. While AIADMK candidate Raajesh said his priority was now to provide concrete houses to slum dwellers, the DMK said it would shut down the Kodungaiyur dump yard and solve the drinking water crisis.

Restrictions on Cenotaph Road to go 

","
CHENNAI: Motorists can breathe easy. The busy intersection of Cenotaph Road with Anna Salai is set to open for two-way traffic from next week, more than seven years after restrictions were put in place to facilitate metro rail work. 


Chennai Metro Rail Ltd (CMRL) had begun underground services on the stretch in May last year but the traffic police was able to take it over only a couple of months later. After the restrictions are removed, motorists coming from Kotturpuram and beyond will be allowed to turn right from Cenotaph Road on to Anna Salai, go further and take a U-turn or turn right on to Bharatidasan Salai on which SIET College is located.

This is expected to reduce the incidence of violations, including jumping of signals, say traffic police officers who plan to operate the Cenotaph Road and SIET (Bharatidasan Salai) traffic signals in tandem. The proposal has been sent to the deputy commissioner of police, south Chennai, along with a prototype working plan.

During the seven years that the restrictions were in place, motorists were only allowed to turn left from Cenotaph Road on to Anna Salai and proceed towards the Nandanam signal. A dedicated bus-lane was provided for vehicles coming from Nandanam to Cenotaph Road. Those coming from Kotturpuram and beyond and wishing to proceed towards Parry’s were forced to travel up to Nandanam junction to take a ‘U’ turn and proceed to their destinations.

 Many motorists going to Chennai Central or Parry’s complained that they had to sweat it out with vehicles going towards Saidapet before taking the U-turn. 

Incidents of traffic violations became common, with cab drivers blatantly proceeding in the wrong direction at great risk to other road-users.

Anumol, a student of SIET College for Women, said that the situation was particularly bad during the morning rush hour. “There were only one or two police personnel on duty at the junction and by the time they reached the spot of violation the offenders would have escaped.”

Now, a traffic police officer said, “We have decided to give 70 seconds to motorists travelling to and fro on Anna Salai, while the vehicles merging from Cenotaph road will be given 25 seconds. After a trial run, we might increase the timing based on the volume of vehicular traffic from Kotturpuram.”

North Chennai: New poll but being fought on old issues 

","
CHENNAI: The late DMK founder and chief minister C N Annadurai used to say “North Shines and South Wanes” (Vadakku vazhgirathu, therku theigirathu) about the step-motherly treatment to the southern states. But in the DMK’s own birthplace, voters rue that “South Chennai thrives while North Chennai wanes”.


Poor infrastructure and lack of job opportunities for educated youth have left the North Chennai Lok Sabha constituency poorly off. But for Metrorail connectivity up to Washermenpet in the last leg of Phase I in February this year, the working class residents of North Chennai have been left behind.




R Subburaj, who lives in New Washermenpet, asks, “Why have the Centre or state government never thought of setting up an IT/ITES park in North Chennai when space is available in Manali. Scores of youth could have got employment, besides boosting the all-round development of North Chennai.” The state government is setting up an IT Park at Pattabiram in Avadi on the western outskirts of Chennai.

White collar jobs, except for some central government establishments, are scarce in the Lok Sabha constituency that comprises Royapuram, RK Nagar, Tiruvottiyur, Thiru-Vi-Ka Nagar, Perambur and Kolathur assembly segments. There is the port and fishing harbour and a hub of retail and wholesale trading, which provides some scope for self-employment.

N Arunkumar, a youngster who runs a textile business at New Washermenpet, says accessing MUDRA loans, under the NDA government’s a flagship programme for lending to micro units through banks, was a herculean task. “I am attempting to avail a Rs 5 lakh loan under MUDRA for the past three months. However, the nationalised bank I approached is discouraging me,” said Arunkumar, who has studied till Class X.

Unlike the rest of Chennai, chemical factories dot the city’s northern fringes causing pollution. S Raj, a fisherman hailing from Kasi Vishwanathan Koil Kuppam at Tiruvottiyur, said pollution caused by a chemical factory near his locality brings untold misery. “The stench is unbearable and no action is being taken to control it despite repeated complaints. Moreover, we were promised that additional groynes would be laid on the seashore to dock our boats safely under the scheme of the Union government, but nothing has been done,” he said.

The current Lok Sabha MP, T G Venkatesh Babu, could not be reached for his comments despite repeated phone calls and text messages. The constituency sees a largely triangular fight among DMK candidate V Kalanidhi, DMDK contestant ‘Alagapuram’ R Mohan Raj with AIADMK’s support, and AMMK candidate P Santhana Krishnan. The constituency has been a fortress of the DMK with the party winning the constituency 10 times since 1957. Currently, of the six assembly segments DMK holds three, the AIADMK has the lone Royapuram constituency, and AMMK deputy secretary T T V Dhinakaran represents R K Nagar. Perambur is facing byelection.

The constituency is key, not least for the atmospherics since leader of the opposition M K Stalin holds the Koluthur assembly segment. Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami launched his poll campaign from Royapuram, but his constant refrain that the DMDK candidate ‘Alagapuram’ R Mohan Raj hails from his native Salem didn’t seem to cut ice with those who came to listen his speech.

Truck with Rs 2.5 crore red sanders seized 

","
CHENNAI: After a 40-day search, customs officials finally traced a container truck carrying red sanders to a godown in Kundrathur on Thursday with the help of CCTV camera footage.


On Februrary 19, the truck was sent back from a container terminal near Chennai harbour as it did not have proper documents for shipping the container. 

Since the truck was not brought back again, officials grew suspicious. They provided the vehicle registration number to police and sought help to trace the truck with the help of CCTV camera footage. The Kundrathur police found that the truck was within their jurisdiction and alerted the officials. Based on their inputs, customs officials raided a warehouse in Thandalam near Kundrathur and found five tonnes of red sanders worth Rs 2.5 crore hidden inside the vehicle. The godown was sealed.

Investigation revealed that a man named Rajinikanth of Kancheepuram district and resident of Valsaravakkam, rented the godown two months ago on the pretext of storing chemicals. A hunt has been launched for Rajinikanth who is absconding.

Chennai: More than 18,000 saplings planted 

","
CHENNAI: Of the 23,000 saplings Greater Chennai Corporation planned to plant across 15 zones, 18,500 have been and the remaining 4,500 saplings will be in place by April. This is as per the plan to replace 17,000 trees uprooted during Cyclone Vardah in December 2016. A part of the ?5cr project, the saplings have been planted in major areas such as Madhavaram, Mogappair, Ambattur, Sholinganallur, Valasarvakkam, Manali and Thiruvotriyur, Anna Nagar and Alandur.


Though the move is appreciated, the timing for planting has been questioned by various activists as Chennai is facing a severe water crisis.

TOI visited areas in Mogappair such as Ambedkar playground, Eri scheme road and Anna Main Road, where saplings were planted. Officials said they were being watered once every four days. But the saplings have not been planted in a row in one area, scattered along various road margins and making the watering process even more difficult. In Madhavaram, 2,690 saplings were planted and 1,930 in Ambattur.

But corporation officials said that they had handed over the contract to a private company that followed scientific methods suggested by an NGO, Care Earth, for planting the saplings. “Only native species such as vaagai, vembu, naatu badam and others that can withstand the heat were being planted. Moreover, the contractor will be responsible for maintenance for a year and will water the saplings,” said an engineer.

Corporation deputy commissioner (works) M Govinda Rao said all the saplings had been planted along the road margins. “We are in the process of identifying locations for planting saplings for the next financial year as a target of 50,000 saplings has been proposed. Vacant lands, burial grounds, parks maintained by Greater Chennai Corporation, playgrounds and roads are being identified to plant them,” he said.

2014 recruitment by Southern Railway gets green signal from CBI 

","
CHENNAI: The Central Bureau of Investigation on Thursday gave a clean chit to the 2014 recruitment made by Southern Railway which was alleged to be a ‘huge scam’ discriminating against candidates from Tamil Nadu.


The primary allegation made against the recruitment in which 12,265 posts of helper, peon, sanitary worker and trackman were filled was that the authorities involved in the recruitment process, particularly from northern states, managed to appoint candidates from their states even for the posts which required knowledge of Tamil.

However, after conducting a preliminary inquiry, CBI informed the court that prima facie there was no case for further investigation.

This apart, railway counsel P T Ramkumar submitted that overall 16,94,729 applications were received for the recruitmentoutof which11,25,405were found to be eligible.

“This includes 3,13,821applications from Tamil Nadu of which2,17,556 werefoundeligible. However, only 30% of the Tamil Nadu applicants attended exams.Of the12,265who qualified for selection, 7,598 were from south India, 3,096 from east India, 1,099 from west India, 448 from north and 24 from central India,” Ramkumar said.

He said the petitioner P Panner Selvam had scored only 4.33 out of 100 in the exam.

Recording the submission, Justice A D Jagadish Chandira closed the petition.

According to the petitioner, on September 21, 2013, the railway recruitment cell, Chennai, issued a notification calling for applications from eligible candidates for Group D posts. The candidate was one among the applicants. A year after the notification, exams were held for the posts between November 2 and 30, 2014. Claiming that the exams were conducted under mysterious circumstance with even hallticketslacking photographs of candidates, the petitioner complained to the CBI. “Such scam has been carried out not only for Grade D posts but also those under Grade A in collusion with railway officials, the petitioner alleged.

HC livid at parties erecting hoardings; government promises action 

","
CHENNAI: Expressing dismay over the continuing menace of illegal digital banners even after a blanket court ban on all political parties from erecting such banners across the state, Madras high court said ‘until recently, the entire stretch up to Adyar bridge looked as if it was leased out to a particular political party.’


Starting from Foreshore Estate and school for deaf and dumb in Santhome everywhere such violations could be witnessed, a division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and Justice M Nirmal Kumar said on Thursday. This apart, the bench pointed out that though a the court had issued a specific direction to the government to come up with a plan for disposal of such banners, which may cause environmental degradation, so far no such report was filed.

“Therefore, necessary additional affidavit is to be filed by the chief secretary to the state government, as to the manner of the disposal of the digital banners and placards after the same were put to use,” the bench said.

The court passed the interim order on the contempt plea moved by social activist Traffic KR Ramaswamy seeking action against officials under Contempt of Court Act for wilful disobedience of court orders.

When the plea came up for hearing on Thursday, the chief secretary filed an affidavit saying all district collectors had been instructed to give top priority to check erection of unauthorised banners and their removal besides closely monitor the situation and enforce the prohibition stringently.

“Through a communication dated February 21, all collectors were instructed to convene a meeting with all political parties jointly with head of police and to issue a detailed circular to the political parties informing them about the relevant rules regarding digital banners and to highlight the orders passed by the court,” the chief secretary said.

The printers of such banners were also strictly informed that they should not print banners without details of permission and that personal particulars of the printer/printing press should be mentioned at the bottom of the banners, she added. This apart, the chief secretary undertook that she would closely monitor the issue and ensure collectors took all out efforts to prevent erection of such unauthorised banners.

Recording the submissions, the bench posted the plea to June 13 for further hearing.

Pitching for a zero food waste IPL at Chepauk 

","
CHENNAI: The food safety department of Tamil Nadu and an NGO have joined hands to reduce food wastage during the Indian Premier League (IPL) matches at the M A Chidambaram stadium in the city. They plan to feed around 1,000 people after every match with the food that is not consumed or remains unsold.


Food safety officials met IPL organizers, members of the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association and vendors who would set up stalls during the match, last week.

“We have worked out the various hunger spots at about 40 locations in the city. We have tied up with No Food Waste who would employ volunteers to collect, pack and distribute the excess food. Permission has been given to place two vans at two gates that would have vessels and packing material,” said food safety officer Ramakrishnan.

Seven matches are scheduled at the stadium where 26 stalls would sell ice cream, cold drinks, rice items, pizzas, snacks, pop corn and other items. There are also arrangements made for the police and administrative staff. Excess food after the match will be handed over to the volunteers.

Officials said the food would be packed and preserved at a certain temperature. “We will only distribute food that is fit for consumption,” said an official.

“After Sunday’s match, we will distribute food to people near Marina Beach, Egmore, Broadway, Central and the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. We have already done a hunger-mapping in the city and have been distributing food at slums in Tambaram, Chromepet, Nanganallur, Kottivakkam, Egmore, Aminjikarai and Thiruvanmiyur. Each vehicle can carry about 500 plates of food. Apart from these locations, 25 slums have been mapped,” said R Arun Kumar, Chennai coordinator of No Food Waste.

Padmanabhan Gopalan, the NGO’s founder, said the organization would want to tie up with all IPL teams to ensure that the tournament becomes a zero food waste event.

Food safety officials said they would set up boards with messages on wastage of food at 53 locations in the stadium that can accommodate 33,000-plus spectators. “We have issued an advisory to the board and all teams to avoid wastage of food. According to the organisers, 10% to 15% food is always dumped. This can be distributed to the needy,” said an official.

The food safety department said it would ensure excess food from all government events are also packed and re-distributed.

Distribution of river sand stopped, allege bodies; PWD denies 

","
CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu State Sand Lorry Owner’s Federation has charged that the Public Works Department (PWD) has stopped online booking for supply of river sand for public distribution.


In a memorandum to chief electoral officer Satyabrata Sahoo, the federation’s president, S Yuvaraj, said the online booking for river sand has been stopped from March 22, citing the Lok Sabha election. This has affected several labourers employed in ferrying sand. “The government has halted the distribution of river sand to the public on the grounds of parliamentary elections. However, there are no restrictions on the operation of Tasmac shops,” he said.

R Panneerselvam, president of the Federation of Tamil Nadu Sand Lorry Owners Coordination, said the PWD has not been supplying sand since one week. “There are nine depots in the Cauvery belt, besides Cuddalore and Villupuram districts. So far, 450 loads of sand were distributed, but it’s been stopped now,” he said. According to him, the PWD was providing sand only to the contractors engaged in public works. “Several builders use river sand as a substitute for m-sand. We are not in a position to supply it,” he said.

Meanwhile, 60,000 tonnes of river sand imported from Malaysia is also lying idle at the Ennore Kamarajar port. Official sources said the sand reached the port last week, which was the fifth consignment from the Southeast Asian country, since the government has been sourcing sand from overseas.

However, PWD sources said the supply of sand has not been stopped. “We open the booking on Friday evening at 4pm and allow booking for the quantity scheduled the following week. Every depot is supplying 150 to 200 loads every day,” the official said. The official said booking for imported sand would start by mid April.

TTV Dhinakaran gets ‘gift pack’ from Election Commission — as symbol 

","
CHENNAI: Ending all suspense and controversies, the Election Commission on Thursday night allocated 'Gift Pack' as the common symbol for all 59 candidates put up by T T V Dhinakaran's Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) in the 40 Lok Sabha seats and 19 assembly by-polls in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry where elections are scheduled to take place on April 18. 


""The EC has decided to allot the common symbol 'gift pack' to all the candidates contesting on behalf of the petitioner group as mentioned in the order of the Supreme Court,"" said EC secretary Pramod Kumar Sharma in a letter to Tamil Nadu and Puducherry chief electoral officers (CEOs). 

The EC's decision to allot a common symbol to all candidates of AMMK, which is yet to be registered, brings to an end the troubles that the party faced in getting a common symbol, in the wake of being an unregistered party. It had to knock on the doors of Supreme Court to get a favourable order and early this week the apex court had directed EC to consider offering a 'common symbol' to AMMK's candidates, even if it cannot allot 'pressure cooker', which the party had sought. By virtue of representing an unregistered party, the AMMK candidates will, however, be treated as independents and the symbol on EVMs too will appear accordingly, well after the national and regional recognized parties.

""The EC's communication came to me on Thursday evening, while I was campaigning in Tiruvallur Lok Sabha constituency. They had asked me to choose one from among 36 symbols. The 'gift pack' resembled a scheme launched by Amma (J Jayalalithaa) in 2016, where several goodies were gift wrapped in a box and given to a new born girl child in government hospitals. I immediately opted for the 'gift box' symbol and EC too had communicated later in the night, confirming the symbol to us,"" AMMK deputy general secretary T T V Dhinakaran told reporters in Kancheepuram. With elections just about 20 days away, AMMK has the hard task to reach the new symbol to the masses. Dhinakaran, who was campaigning in Arakkonam Lok Sabha consittuency on Friday held a model of the 'gift pack' symbol in his hand. Party cadres too had got ready a few models. The AMMK's IT wing started the exercise to popularize the symbol from the morning. ""We used all social media platforms, including twitter, instagram, Facebook and Whatsapp to spread the symbol and within couple of hours messages had reached 2-3 crore voters in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry,"" claimed a source in theparty's IT wing.

Free ranging deer soon to be rescued 

","
CHENNAI: The spotted deer that used to roam on the roads will soon be rescued and rehabilitated inside Guindy National Park. Wildlife officials in Chennai have already rescued spotted deer roaming freely in many parts of the city — other than Guindy National Park and IIT-Madras campus. The authorities have submitted a proposal to revive the rescue work, and expect to be given the nod soon.


A senior wildlife official said these spotted deer had been spotted roaming freely at least in a dozen places. At times, they stray on to the road and get injured or are run over by speeding vehicles. In order to avoid such incidents and to protect the species, the wildlife officials have given a proposal to rescue them, the official said.

The wildlife managers have identified more than a dozen locations across the city. This included Ekkatuthangal, AGS Colony, Baby Nagar, Adambakkam, Taramani, Kotturpuram, Nagi Reddy Thottam, Saidapet, YMCA Nandanam, Thandeeswaran Nagar, Velacherry, Selaiyur, Avadi, Madhavaram, CLRI campus, Tod Hunter Nagar and the Air Force station in Tambaram. All these areas have spotted a deer population of nearly 750.

Already, a forester along with a guard visited these places and plans have been drawn on how to trap the free-ranging ungulates. One of the ways is by keeping feed in a particular place every day to attract the deer. Generally, cattle feed will be used for this purpose. A team of workers will stay near the feed to make the deer feel comfortable. After a week or so it will be trapped by the workers, the officer said.

The department has already recruited seven people to trap the deer. They will be taught how to trap the deer without getting injured. As per the plan, three deer will be trapped in the morning, and three in the evening. They will be safely transported to the isolated enclosure inside the children’s park, the official said.

AIADMK, DMK keep mum on MoU with railway ministry 

","
CHENNAI: The DMK manifesto has more promises to improve the railway infrastructure in Tamil Nadu than the one presented by the rival AIADMK.


However, neither party has explained how it plans to address the two core issue that are impeding the progress of railway projects in the state, signing of an Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the railway ministry and easing out land acquisition issues.

The MoU was mooted by the NDA government about three years ago wherein state governments were asked to share 50% of the burden to fund railway projects. The land was supposed to be given free of cost by the state for the project, the policy read. Many states including neighbouring Kerala have signed the MoU.

However, former chief minister J Jayalalithaa had written to the railways asking it to consider the cost of land provided by the state government as equity contribution of the state and, in effect, asked for a modification of the policy.

As of now, TN is yet to budge on this and has not signed it. “This has resulted in the state not getting more projects. If the MoU is signed, funds for additional projects can be released,” said the official. He also cited the delays in land acquisition by the state government which had delayed already announced projects, for which the Southern Railway general manager has already briefed the chief secretary on many occasions.

Neither the DMK nor the AIADMK has indicated any solution for this in the manifestos.

The ruling AIADMK has given only three points pertaining to railways: urging allocation of funds for Chennai-Puducherry and Tindivanam-Nagari routes, trains to district headquarters, and stoppage of trains at all important towns.

The DMK has a much detailed manifesto on railways. The drafting chairman T R Baalu is a former chairman of the railway standing committee. The party has announced third and fourth lines between Chennai-Madurai-Kanyakumari, Chennai - Coimbatore and Avadi – Oragadam - Singamperumalkovil lines.

The party manifesto has also proposed rto set up ailway terminals at Ambattur and Royapuram stations for decongestion of Chennai Central.

Other interesting points include additional DEMUs in towns and a Chenna-like MRTS network for Madurai, Coimbatore, Trichy and Salem cities.

Government bus drivers told not to halt at hotels in suburbs

CHENNAI: The State Express Transport Corporation has instructed drivers not to halt at eateries or hotels located on the Chennai-Villupuram and Villupuram-Ulundurpet highway stretches. 


At present, more than 1,200 buses are operated by the corporation across Tamil Nadu. Of this, 450 are operated daily from Chennai to Madurai, Trichy, Coimbatore, Thanjavur and Nagercoil. 

The SETC has received complaints from passengers stating many buses halt at eateries as they near Chennai for more than 15 minutes. They said that drivers and conductors are either given free meals or incentives to halt at these private food outlets. In a letter dated March 25, the SETC has stated that no permission has been granted to halt at these eateries. It only increases travel time and decreases passenger footfall.

The letter has instructed respective branch managers to take action against erring drivers. 

Drivers, in response, have rejected allegations pertaining to incentives and claimed that they hardly get 15-20 minutes break during the 8-10 hour journeys to southern or western districts of Tamil Nadu and it is unfair to expect us to overcome fatigue without breaks.

Ex-chairman of Indian Bank gets three years in jail 

","
CHENNAI: The CBI court in Chennai convicted former chairman and managing director of Indian Bank M Gopalakrishnan and 11 others and handed them three years rigorous imprisonment (RI) in a bank fraud case on Thursday. This is the fifth conviction for Gopalakrishnan in similar cases. 


The anti-corruption branch of the CBI had registered a case against Gopalakrishnan and five other bank officials on allegations that they had sanctioned huge credit facilities, including foreign bill purchase facilities and import letter of credit, to a company in 1997. The officials had colluded with M/S Enkay Foods Pvt Ltd, which was one of the group companies floated of M Vardarajalu alias M V Raja, chairman of M/S MGR Group Companies, in the name of his associates.

Inquiries revealed that the officials sanctioned loans without proper verification and assessment, and without obtaining proper collateral securities. They helped the accused divert funds for other purposes and had caused wrongful loss of Rs 29.87 crore to Indian Bank.

CBI officials had filed a charge sheet against Gopalakrishnan and five other bank officials apart from six private individuals. On completion of the trial, principal special judge for CBI cases Neela Prasad convicted the accused and sentenced them to undergo three years of rigorous imprisonment. A total fine of Rs 2.45 lakh was also imposed on them.

The Indian Bank scam and Gopalakrishnan's role were exposed after Subramanian Swamy approached courts against the non-action of CBI in mid-90s. It was alleged that the bank fell into crisis after bad loans were given under the direction of Gopalakrishnan to many private firms and benami companies.

Suffering from age-related complications, Gopalakrishnan is out on bail. More than 10 cases are pending against him including appeals against convictions.

Temple ritual never filmed, Madras high court informed

“The kumbhabhishekam conducted in 2004 was not videographed and we do not have copies of any such recording,” counsel for the executive officer (EO) of the temple said.

Directing the EO to make his submission through an affidavit, a special bench of Justice R Mahadevan and Justice PD Audikesavalu said, “We would like to remind you that this court made references to the videograph of the kumbhabhishekam in the order dismissing the bail application of Thirumagal.”

Noting that the court would direct the registry to videograph the next hearing of the case, the bench said if needed it would ask all the officers who were in service during the kumbhabhishekam to file affidavits.

The court then directed the commissioner of the department to file a separate affidavit as to the maintenance of records pertaining to the idols in temples, particularly that of antique value and why no action has been taken against the additional commissioner despite the fact that the court has rejected her bail application.

Tamil Nadu: Seized Rs 10 crore handed back to bank officials 

","
TIRUPUR: Income Tax department officials handed over Rs 10 crore, seized by election authorities, to officials of Tamil Nadu Mercantile Bank after nine hours of enquiry in Tamil Nadu's Tirupur on Thursday night.


An election static surveillance team captured the money when TMB officials were taking it in Karadivavi near Palladam in Tirupur district on Thursday. Though the private bank officials submitted a document which stated that the money was transported from Podanur of Coimbatore to Pudukottai in Thoothukudi district, IT officials were called in to verify the document.

Sources said since the document carried that the money was transported to a TMB branch in Pudukottai in Thoothukudi, the IT officials were confused it with Pudukottai district. After nine hours, the money was handed back to the bank officials.

‘North Chennai requires a separate infrastructure plan’ 

","
A first-time Lok Sabha candidate, Dr Kalanidhi Veerasamy has been fielded in North Chennai where DMK veterans like N V N Somu, Nanjil K Manoharan and C Kuppusamy had contested and won. Dr Kalanidhi spoke to B Sivakumar on the key issues plaguing the constituency.

Q: Water shortage is a big problem in the North Chennai. What are your promises for tackling it?

A: Yes, it is a key issue in North Chennai but in other city constituencies too people are facing water shortage. North Chennai consists of 6 assembly constituencies and in each the issues are different. For instance, in R K Nagar, the majority of the population is poor and they need employment and better standard of living. But for North Chennai, the main issue is the Kodungaiyur dump yard and steps need to be taken immediately to stop garbage being dumped in the area and to prevent air pollution.

Q: Big trucks and heavy vehicles use roads in some of the constituency. How safe is it?

A: Heavy vehicles and trucks from the harbour use the road like other vehicles. There was a proposal for a separate road, but, it is yet to be implemented. We will work towards a dedicated road.

Q: How safe is the drinking water in North Chennai?

A: Every now and then we get complaints in the constituency about drinking water mixing with sewage. I have been practising in R K Nagar and other places for the last 15 years and most of my patients have been affected due to polluted water. With no local bodies in place, we need to take urgent steps to change the drinking water pipes and prevent mixing with sewage.

Q: Is it possible to bridge the North-South divide?

A: In terms of infrastructure, North Chennai needs a separate plan. Most of the roads are narrow and built more than a century ago when there were not so many vehicles. People in North Chennai don’t feel there is a divide in the standard of living. Each area has an affluent section as well as the poor quarters. It is only when it rains, people in North Chennai suffer due to poor drainage. Otherwise, there is happiness even among people living in small houses.

Q: What is your proposal for increasing jobs for youths in North Chennai?

A: It is only due to unemployment, youths take to drugs and also team up with thugs. But things have changed for the better and youths are now employed in the IT sector and other companies. Still we need to find more employment for youths.

4 surrender in DMDK functionary murder case 

","
CHENNAI: Four people surrendered in connection with the murder of DMDK functionary S Pandian in broad daylight in Padi on Thursday.


Police said Arch Vinoth surrendered at a court in Thirukazhukundram, while Gautham, Narasimhan and Prashanth surrendered at Egmore Court on Friday. Police said all of them were hired killers and were not aware of the motive behind the murder.

Design meets cause to raise funds for children 

","
Renowned designer Tarun Tahiliani’s ‘Spring Summer ‘19’ paints a pharaonic landscape taking inspirations from Egypt, rediscovering the treasures of one of the world’s oldest civilisations. 
“On my recent visit to Egypt, I was struck by the gold, the glamour, the way they use semi-precious stones and drape their ivory linen fabrics — it all reverberated so perfectly with our own design philosophy,” said Tarun Tahiliani. 


Traversing beyond the cinematic clichés, the design dives deep into the ancient archives. “Last year, we took a seven-member design team to Egypt to study their ancient art and design. We also showcased our work at the India House in Cairo for the ‘India by the Nile Festival’. One can see the painstakingly detailed motifs and embroideries that our skilled team has re-created from the museum references, but the silhouettes and colour are still largely our own signature,” he added. 
This initiative is part of a fundraiser campaign by Madras Round Table 1, a charitable organisation that has been raising resources for community service initiatives focused on children’s education and healthcare. Their flagship project for this year is the ‘Keep Them In School’ campaign that focuses on five under-resourced schools in the city.

Now watch rocket launches from ISRO gallery at Sriharikota 

","
CHENNAI: Space technology enthusiasts and visitors to the Sriharikota space port could soon get a clear and closer view of the rocket launches, as ISRO is opening a new launch-viewing gallery at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre. The gallery, with a 5,000-seating capacity, will be inaugurated on March 31.


In a post in their website, the space agency has said the gallery has been built at an appropriate location with clear line of sight to the two launch pads of the Sriharikota Range. “Visitors can view launch from this gallery in real time with naked eyes. Large screens are also placed to visually explain the various intricacies of launcher and satellites. In addition, pre and post-launch activities will be telecast and explained through these screens to the viewers,” the agency said.

The gallery has been built to cater to the increasing demand for witnessing rocket launches. It has, so far, been accommodating a limited number of visitors to witness launches from the country’s only space port.

It is part of the initiative to spread awareness about the benefits of space technology. “Space has revolutionized the life of human being by bringing variety of applications to the door step of every common man. It has kindled a natural curiosity and ever-increasing interest in every individual, towards the Indian space programme,” the space agency said in the post.

Lok Sabha elections: Chitalapakkam residents list out issues for their candidates 

","
CHENNAI: Residents of Chitalapakkam, which comes under Sriperumbudur parliamentary constituency, have formed a group - Chitalapakkam rising - and listed out issues that they expect their candidates to resolve.


The residents want the candidates to sign a memorandum which comes with an assurance of finding solutions to several issues that the town panchayat faces. The locality is on the southern periphery of the city, sandwiched between Old Mahabalipuram road and the Chennai-Trichy highway. 

For instance, the Chitalapakkam lake is a thorny issue, on which the residents have been agitating for many years now. “We have demanded that the candidate should recover, restore and rejuvenate the lake. The candidate should also ensure that Selaiyur and Sembakkam lakes are restored,” said Sunil Jayaram from the group.

Chitalapakkam has around 39,000 registered voters in the Sriperumbudur Lok Sabha constituency which has around 12 lakh voters.

The group has already met DMK candidate TR Baalu who has promised to look into the memorandum. They are scheduled to meet PMK candidate Vaithilingam tomorrow morning. Talks are also on with the MNM and Naam Tamizhar Katchi candidates, Jayaram said. The other issues include adequate drinking water supply, underground drainage system, better access to public transport and implementation of underground cabling for electricity transmissions. The voters feel that this is the ideal time for them to highlight the long-pending issues as all candidates would be soliciting votes. “We are also in touch with the local DMK MLA Raja to co-ordinate on these issues,” Sunil said.

Lord MGR bridges political divide in Tiruvallur temple 

","
CHENNAI: Every Sunday, since the poll dates were announced, the crowd of devotees at the Arulmigu MGR Aalayam at Nathamedu in Tiruvallur district, 45 km from Chennai, has been swelling. Thanks to the special offering to the god — movies of M G Ramachandran (fondly called MGR) between 5pm and 8pm.


MGR, the actor-politician of yesteryear who is the deity at the temple, has been attracting leaders and workers from across the political spectrum, besides regular devotees.

L Kalaivanan, who built the temple in 2011, says he is busy as not only members of the AIADMK, the party MGR founded, but also those from other political outfits have started visiting the temple to get the blessings of MGR.

Huge cut-outs of the star put up by Kalaivanan greet devotees at the temple which is open every day between 9am and 8pm. Though rituals such as tonsuring of head take place every day and even childless couples flock to the temple for progeny, the temple stands out for its unique devotional hymns — songs from old MGR movies.

Kalaivanan, who grew up watching MGR movies, started offering prayer to photographs of the matinee-idol after his death in 1987. “Each MGR movie taught me a lesson. As the LS poll is nearing, there is huge rush. Candidates and cadres come and pray for their victory,” said Kalaivanan, a newspaper distributor.


Wife’s dream made fan build temple for MGR

The management committee members of the temple are particular about choosing songs and cut-outs of MGR. “We don’t play love songs, we rather use songs that can provide people insight about life,” said a member. Some party workers have been observing a 41-day ‘vritha’ after wearing bead garland for the smooth victory of their candidate. “This is like what pilgrims do in Sabarimala, the famous hill shrine in Kerala. They remove the garland of beads standing before the idol of MGR after completing the 41-day vritha. This year, we have a lot of devotees doing this for the smooth victory of their party leaders,” said Shanthi.

“I am not a fan of MGR, I am a devotee of that great man,” says the 66-year-old.

The temple has a small hall with a sanctum sanctorum with two idols of MGR. A chair that MGR used at his house in Ramapuram is also kept close to the wall.

For Kalaivanan, there is a reason for building the temple. One day, his wife Shanthi had a dream in which MGR walked into their house and rested a while on the sofa. He looked sad. The couple then decided to construct a temple for him. Kalaivanan had to sell his property at Pudupet in Chennai to fulfil his wife’s dream.

Survivor support services for trauma care through psychologists/psychiatrists, medical care, legal aid, assistance of women's rights activists and other such measures also should be extended to the victims, they said.

Representing the petitioners, senior counsel R Vaigai submitted that the state had created a hostile situation by disclosing the name and identity of the victim who had lodged the complaint. 

""The victims are in urgent need of support, including doctor, psychologist and legal aid. We were told that even engagement of a victim was cancelled due the prevailing situation,"" senior counsel Vaigai added.

Gopal has been directed to appear on April 1.

The court passed the order on a plea moved by Gopal challenging the summons. When the plea came up for hearing, his counsel contended that Gopal had been summoned to Pollachi only to be harassed.

State public prosecutor submitted that it would be appropriate for the petitioner to appear in Pollachi. 

However, concurring with the submissions of Gopal, the judge permitted him to appear in CB-CID's Chennai office.

Seven murders in five days, two reported in last 24 hours 

","
CHENNAI: The law enforcers are busy with election duties and the city and its suburbs have seen a spurt in brutal crimes. Seven murders have taken place in the city and suburban areas in the last five days. Two murders were reported in the past 24 hours. Both the murders involved violent gangs who chased their targets and hacked them in full public view.


The manner in which the crimes were committed shows police have lost their deterrent power, said retired police officer S Aravindan. It reflects poorly on the current law and order situation, he said. “Law and order cannot take a back seat, especially at a time when lots of political meetings and campaigns are being held,” he added. 




Police said the murder of the reformed criminal, Krishnamurthy, was reported around 10.45am in Arumbakkam, when most of the city police personnel were deployed in southern suburban areas, Nanganallur and Perungudi, where chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami was campaigning on Wednesday evening. 

A few residents of the area had called the city police control room to inform about the murder. When some of them visited the Arumbakkam police station, they spotted less than half a dozen police personnel at the station. The available police personnel visited all the houses and shops in the area to make sure a video of the murder is not uploaded on social media. A senior police officer said, “We have solved the case within a day and nabbed five suspects. These assailants followed the suspect and targeted him at Arumbakkam. It was an act of revenge.”

The murder of Pandian, a DMDK worker, was reported in Korattur on Thursday morning.

A senior police officer said, “We cannot keep a watch on each and every suspect. We have a separate city intelligence team monitoring the suspects coming out of the Puzhal prison on a daily basis.”

A train will be available every 30 minutes from 4.30am to 6am and from 10pm to 11pm, while the existing schedule will be followed between 6am and 10pm. The extension of services will benefit early birds, morning joggers, late shift workers and commuters heading to railway stations or the airport to catch late night and early trains/ flights.


“We have arranged sufficient security and staff required to operate services from 4.30am. We expect the extension of services to attract and benefit more commuters,” a metro rail official said.

At present, metro trains are available from 6am to 10pm. In the new schedule, the first train from Washermenpet, Airport, Chennai Central and St Thomas Mount will depart at 4.30am and the last train at 11pm.

During non-peak hours, trains will be operated every seven minutes. The new extended timings will be followed from Monday to Saturday. On Sundays, the existing time table will be followed with services from 7.58am to 10pm, officials said.

CMRL has been conducting trial runs for the past six months, operating trains from 4.30am to 11pm, while the actual operational hours continued to be from 6am to 10pm. The trials were done to synchronise operations, duty hours of staff members, requirement of additional manpower at stations and daily maintenance of trains after operational hours. “We have been making station controllers and staff who work on shifts to begin their duty at 4.30am to check for smooth daily operations,” an official said. “We also had to check if our daily maintenance of trains was feasible within the reduced time left after the extension”.

Metro rail was also working to make security arrangements to cover the extended hours. At present, outsourced private security personnel and state police guard metro stations in the city. “Based on the response, we will increase the frequency in the early morning hours,” an official said.

Life from the Sangam period at this exhibition 

","
This art exhibition by Koil Pitchai Prabakar gives a glimpse of the Sangam Period, the Christian settlement in various parts of Tamil Nadu such as Mudalur and Udangudi, and also bits from the artist’s life around the seashore districts of Tirunelveli. “I grew up in and around the villages of Tirunelveli where most of my schooling happened. My paintings have buildings, infrastructure and human characters that were quite common to spot those days. I’ve also painted Sangam landscape like Kurinji, Mullai, Marutham, Neithal and Paalai, where humans lived happily without damaging the environment,” says Prabakar. 

On asking about his fascination for portraying rural women in traditional attire with ears habitually stretched with heavy gold ornaments, he says, “It not only depicts an older generation, but also talks about the customs prevailing since then. In many villages, little girls are forced to pierce their ears and wear heavy earrings until they get married in a well-off family. The weight of their jewels decides the family they will be married to. After they are married, the heavy earrings are taken by the groom’s family, leaving their ears stretched with large holes for the rest of their life.”

Rajan expressed the need for an inter-disciplinary approach where economics integrates with history, politics, psychology, sociology and emerging fields like data-science to better understand and solve real-world problems.

Education, he said, should become experiential in nature, enabling students to not just consume information, but also use it effectively in the real world. 

During question time, students asked questions covering a wide range of topics such as automation, Artificial Intelligence, inflation vs deflation, crypto currencies, monetary policy and the need for new institutions.

CBSE schools to be back on online application site 

","
CHENNAI: Parents willing to admit their children under the Right to Education (RTE) quota can apply online from April 22 to May 18.


This academic year (2019-20), CBSE schools are also likely to be made available in the designated online application-cum-admission portal created by the state school education department. So, 8,000 more seats will be available in 900 CBSE schools across Tamil Nadu.

According to official data, already 1.2 lakh seats are available in private matriculation schools for those belonging to economically weaker sections and socially backward groups under the act.

The application portal is under construction and plans are on to add all nonminority, self-financing institutions this time, as per the notification, indicating that CBSE schools might also figure in the list of available school options. However, there was no official confirmation.

Until last year, CBSE was not part of the portal and except for a handful of CBSE schools, the rest were denied admission under the RTE quota stating that government hasn't reimbursed money for admissions made.

Admitting this, a senior official from the education department officials said the state has sanctioned ?247cr for admissions made in 2017-18 and has so far released more than ?400cr towards this from 2014 to 2018. But the central government is yet to release its share of ?240cr till date.

Consequently, the state revised the admission guidelines last year resulting in a drop in admissions under the RTE quota for the first time since its introduction in 2011.

However, activists have called this as mere eyewash. ""Most of the top CBSE schools have already completed their admission process after receiving donations and by the time the portal is launched, it will be too late,"" said V Eswaran of the MDMK.

SC upholds Saravana Bhavan owner’s life term in murder case 

","
NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the conviction and life sentence awarded to P Rajagopal, owner of popular south Indian restaurant chain Saravana Bhavan, for murdering one of his employees 18 years ago to take the widow as his third wife. 


A bench of Justices N V Ramana, Mohan M Shantanagoudar and Indira Banerjee took note of the circumstantial and forensic evidence, including DNA reports, to conclude that Rajagopal, with the help of four others, had meticulously planned and executed the kidnapping and murder of Shathakumar in 2001 to enable him to fulfil his desire of marrying Shantakumar's wife.




""Having regard to entire material on record and totality of facts and circumstances, we find that the evidence fully proves the prosecution case and that the trial court as well as the high court evaluated the material on record in its proper prospective while coming to their conclusion. 

Thus, the judgment of the trial court as modified by the HC need not be interfered with,"" the bench said and dismissed the appeal against the Madras HC's decision to award life sentence to Rajagopal and his associates in crime.


‘Rajagopal interfered in her personal matters’
The SC gave details of Rajagopal’s obsession with taking the married woman as his third wife. “Either upon the advice of an astrologer or having become besotted with the woman, he had evinced a keen desire to take her as his third wife, though she was already married to Santhakumar (the deceased).”

“In order to fulfil his desire, Rajagopal used to financially help the woman, her family members and her husband. He usedtotalktoher over phonefrequently and gave her costly gifts such as jewellery and sarees and even paid her medical bills. He frequently interfered in her personal matters,” thecourtsaidbefore detailing the manner in which Rajagopal got Santhakumar murdered. Justice Shantanagoudar said though the prosecution case hinged mainly on circumstantial evidence and the theory of the deceased last seen with the accused, it was well established that “if the alleged circumstances are conclusively proved before the court by leading cogent and reliableevidence, the court need not look any further before affirming the guilt of the accused.”

Ideas shine in festival of innovation 

","
AHMEDABAD: Visitors at the eighth edition of Empresario, the annual student startup summit at the Entreprenurship Development Institute of India (EDII) saw a lineup of entry and mid-level startups from across the country. While a carpenter supported by NID participated in the event with his air-conditioned sofa, a Delhi-based startup promised a herbal medicine for menstrual cramps. 





 Dr Sunil Shukla, director of EDII, said that the economy and society need resilient interventions, specifically in the hinterland where traditional businesses still thrive. “Gujarat has one of the most robust of the ecosystems for new startups and it is a platform for students and innovators to connect with industry and experts,” he said. 

Savji Dholakia, who was part of the discussion on ‘Manufacturing New India,’ said, “Fear is the primary reason behind unsuccessful businesses. Many entrepreneurs put their best brains on executing key ideas, but somewhere they lack a connect with the people. Any decision taken from the heart will be successful, unless it is at the cost of damage to the nation, family or the entrepreneur themselves.”

‘Yousuf calling Al Mujeeb’ 

","
AHMEDABAD: It was the interception of a continuous VHF (very high frequency) message, “Yousuf calling Al Mujeeb” that alerted the Gujarat ATS team on board an ICG boat, on the night of March 27, that something was wrong. The message got them going from their position, about 170 nautical miles off Porbandar coast, and within hours with the help of radars and night-vision cameras they located the Iranian dhow which was carrying 100kg of heroin.

The ICG boat continuously gave signals to the dhow to surrender but the crew members of the dhow blew it up in the hope of destroying evidence and jumped into the sea.

“With the dhow in flames, officials of ICG and Gujarat ATS jumped into the sea and rescued the nine Iranians Amin Dorjade, Mohammed Aslam Abdil, Ishaq Karim, Ayyub Baloch, Wahid Baloch, Taher Raz, Sajid Khuse, Sajid Umar and Dor Mohammed Raisee,” said DIG, ATS Himanshu Shukla.

The Iranian smugglers were calling for Al Mujeeb, an Indian dhow, which was to pick up the heroin consignment and bring it to Porbandar. One Raju from Rajkot was to accompany Al Mujeeb. Investigators said that from Porbandar, the heroin was to be sent by road to Mumbai to one Badruddin Shaikh, who was to send it to one Moin Shaikh in Delhi. During interrogation of the accused at the ICG Jetty at Porbandar it came to light that the dhow had left an Iranian port on March 23 and reached Gwadar Port of Pakistan. “Here the heroin was loaded on the dhow by one Mohammed Hameed Malek of Pakistan. The dhow was to transfer the Rs 500 crore worth of illegal narcotics to the Indian dhow, Al Mujeeb, about 90 nautical miles off the coast,” said an investigator.

GVFL to invest Rs 100 crore to fund startups 

","
AHMEDABAD: In a major boost to startups in Gujarat and India, a venture finance company based in Ahmedabad, Gujarat Venture Finance Limited (GVFL), announced that it plans to invest Rs 100 crore to fund startups across the country. The investment will be made by December 2020, confirmed GVFL CEO, Mihir Joshi, while interacting with reporters on the sidelines of a startup investment event organized in Ahmedabad on Wednesday.

“On an average, our company invests in 7-8 companies in a year from our startup fund. The investment fund that has gone into the startups has been raised through a venture fund rolled out by GVFL. The venture fund has been approved by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI),” said Joshi.

The company has already invested in some eight startups. “We have already made an investment worth Rs 50 crore over the past year and a half to fund some eight startups based in India. Of these, five startups were based out of Gujarat. The average ticket size of investments made so far ranges from Rs 5-10 crore depending on the fund requirement by these startups,” he added.

This means a corpus worth Rs 150 crore has gone into funding of startups since 2017. The startups funded by GVFL are mainly technology startups operating in sectors such as financial technology, healthcare technology and agriculture technology, among others. “We are looking at technology startups across the spectrum. These also include startups working in sectors such as industrial technology, internet of things, automation, robotics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, among several others. The idea is to identify startups that can be scaled up to a national or a global level,” said Joshi.

“In fact, last year, we invested in four startups and of them, three companies were scaled so well that they received a second round of funding through bigger investors,” he added.

Russian woman promises not to enter India without valid visa 

","
AHMEDABAD: Anastasiia Leonskaia, the Russian woman facing charges of illegal entry and overstaying her visa, gave an undertaking to the Gujarat high court on Thursday, stating that if she is allowed to leave the country, she will never return to India without a valid visa.

Last week, the high court asked her to present an undertaking that she would not violate the law in the future, when Leonskaia’s advocate Nachiket Dave insisted that since no offence was found against her during her stays in India, she should be granted an exit permit or deported so she could reunite with her 7-year-old daughter Maitino Stefania in Irkutsk city.

The 38-year-old woman, with her infant son, has been requesting an exit permit after she realised that her daughter’s caretaker had died and she could be sent to an orphanage.

After she moved the HC because she got not response from the Foreign Regional Registration Office (FRRO) to two requests for an exit permit. She had received a letter from the guardianship authority in her native town, stating that if she did not return, her daughter would be sent to an orphanage.

After she moved the HC, the FRRO registered an FIR against Leonskaia with city crime branch, accusing her of entering India in December 2016 illegally from Nepal and violating provisions of the Foreigners Act.

In an undertaking she filed in the high court, Leonskaia said, “If I am given exit permit and/or deported from India, I shall never re-enter India without a valid visa.” She has agreed to provide her biometric data to the Indian agencies and to abide by all conditions imposed by the high court.

Justice Sonia Gokani posted a further hearing for Monday, when the authorities will reply to Leonskaia’s undertaking.

No evidence found against ‘peeping Tom’ 

","
Ahmedabad: A 20-year-old man accused of indulging in voyeurism at a Vastrapur mall last Wednesday is likely to go free as police and forensic experts did not find evidence against him.

An FSL team looked into all aspects of the incident, such as the height of the wall of the changing room at the clothing showroom and the height of the accused. It was found that the accused, who is 5’3” in height, would not be able to peep over the 7-foot wall even if he stood on a box there, which was about four inches high.

Besides, police did not find finger marks on the changing room wall, so it is impossible to arraign him, a senior Vastrapur police official said.

According to the complaint filed by the woman’s husband, an oncologist in the Judges Bungalows area, he had gone to the mall with his wife that day. He tried on some clothes in the changing room and he found that it was open from the top.

When he man left the cubicle, he asked a staffer about his wife. The staffer pointed to a cubicle. Then he spotted an employee, about 20 years old, peeping into another cubicle. Moments later, he saw his wife emerge from the cubicle in which the employee had been peeping.

The man raised the issue with the showroom manager, who apologized for the incident. He later spoke to the area manager of the showroom and emailed a complaint to the company the showroom belonged to. He then filed the complaint with Vastrapur police.

HC rules that treatment for genetic disorder can’t be called cosmetic 

","
AHMEDABAD: Medical treatment for genetic disorder cannot be termed as treatment for body shape, Gujarat high court has held so and ordered the state government to reimburse medical bills with interest to a teacher for his daughter’s treatment.


It was a 15 years long battle for an assistant teacher in Rajpipla, Harshadkumar Pandya, who sought reimbursement of Rs 1,53,462 — the amount he had spent in 2002 to treat his four-year-old daughter, who was suffering from Russell-Silver Syndrome, a kind of dwarfism. This is a genetic disorder that causes malfunction of the pituitary gland.

Pandya got his daughter treated on advice of government doctors. She was given an imported drug called Norditropin. 

When he sought reimbursement of the medical expenditure, his request was turned down ostensibly because Norditropin was not a lifesaving drug and the treatment undertaken was only meant for physical enhancement. Pandya approached the high court in 2004.

On Monday, Justice A S Supehia refused to buy the government’s arguments that the treatment in this case falls in the categories — physical comfort/energy, for cosmetic and physical shape. 

Medical reimbursement cannot be allowed if a person gets treatment under these categories. The HC said, “The treatment of four and a half years old daughter who was suffering from the disease of pituitary gland known as Russell-Silver Syndrome, a genetic disorder, and if not treated leads to various complications cannot be equated with the aforesaid category.”

The HC further said that the government itself admitted that the child was suffering from the disease. The HC also pointed out that drug Norditropin was nowhere mentioned in the list of imported drugs which are inadmissible for the purpose of reimbursement.

The high court ordered the government to reimburse the medical bills to the teacher with 9% interest within six weeks’ time.

AHMEDABAD: When Vinayak, 6, started speaking in broken French at Shishu Gruh on Wednesday, Jeremy and Madeline Platin, residents of Pont De L’Arche in northern France, had tears in their eyes. Their four-year wait to adopt children from India ended with the formalities of adoption getting completed. The couple will fly to France from Delhi on Wednesday night with Vinayak, 6, and Vignesh, 5.


The brothers, mention Shishu Gruh officials, were found from near Kubernagar railway crossing exactly a year ago in April 2018. Police tried to trace their parents and came to know that they had lost their father early in life and their mother had died a few days before they were found. A body in Civil Hospital was eventually identified as their mother.

Ritesh Dave, superintendent of Shishu Gruh at Paldi, said,“The only condition we had in mind was, they should be adopted together. About five to seven couples from India had been approached. Later the kids were put in the common pool – open to foreigners,” he said.

With help of an interpreter, Jeremy Platin said that his father had spent some time in India and thus when they expressed their wish for adoption, his father suggested to search in India. The adoption took place in presence of city police commissioner A K Singh, Shishu Gruh board chair C K Patel and other dignitaries. 

Wednesday morning also remained memorable for the Shishu Gruh kids as the Platins arrived with a cake as a farewell gesture.

Ahmedabad Hooch tragedy: Eight women among 10 convicted, 12 set free 

","
AHMEDABAD: Almost 10 years after 149 persons died in a hooch tragedy, a city sessions court on Thursday held 10 persons including eight women guilty of culpable homicide, manufacturing, supplying and selling spurious liquor and punished them with jail term. Twelve other accused were acquitted. 




The order which handed out jail terms ranging from six months to 10 years to the convicted came as a slight setback for the state government, which had introduced murder charge in the Gujarat Prohibition Act in the event of such hooch tragedy. This charge entailed maximum punishment of death sentence. 

The murder charges, however, could not be proven in this case, but two persons were held guilty of culpable homicide.

The court recorded conviction in a case registered with Kagdapith police station, where 34 persons had died in July 2009, mainly in Kantodiawas in Raipur. Twenty-four persons were put on trial. A second case was registered in Odhav police station. Thirty-nine persons are awaiting court verdict in this case in which 115 persons were reported dead.


Hooch tragedy: 321 witnesses examined
The court concluded that the main accused Vinod Thakkar alias Dagri and Arvind alias Ghanshyam Talpada had knowledge of use of methanol in making liquor, but the prosecution could not prove their intention to kill people. They were acquitted of murder charge in section 302 of IPC but were punished under section 304 Part II of IPC.

Additional sessions judge D P Mahida awarded 10 years' jail term and imposed fine of Rs 50,000 fine to Dagri, while Talpada got seven-years imprisonment. They also got punished under the prohibition laws. Eight women accused Vimla Chunara, Sunita Ashok Chunara, Asha Chunara, Sunita Mahesh Chunara, Lata Chunara, Sajjan Chunara, Somiben Thakor and Ganga Chunara were convicted for supply and sale of spurious liquor. Seven got six months jail while Somiben got two-year jail term in connection with various sections of prohibition laws.

One of the defence counsel, Ilyaskhan Pathan said, ""The prosecution could not prove the liquor supply channel and this led to acquittal of 12 accused persons. Those women who have been convicted were exonerated of murder and culpable homicide charges.""

The prosecution examined 321 witnesses in this case. The trial in this case remained in controversy after the state government invoked section 268 of the CrPC against the accused and restricted their movement outside the Sabarmati central jail premise. It was Gujarat high court that revoked the restrictions and the accused got bail.

AMC locks up 3 BSNL offices over unpaid property tax 

","
AHMEDABAD: The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation sealed three offices of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, for unpaid property tax dues. The dues of these three offices add up to about Rs 3 crore.


The offices of Union government entities such as BSNL, Indian Railways and the postal department, and the state government’s police department, have not paid property tax dues amounting to Rs 36 crore, AMC sources said.

The three BSNL offices sealed were those at Gulbai Tekra, CG Road and Naranpura. The dues of the Gulbai Tekra office are Rs 1.85 crore, the CG Road one owes Rs 1.23 crore and the Naranpura office has to pay Rs 21.53 lakh.

BSNL officials will meet Nehra on Thursday and have assured him that the arrears will be cleared before March 31. Nehra said, “Senior officials from BSNL had called me and we are meeting tomorrow. They have promised to pay the dues before March 31. On getting this assurance, the AMC immediately permitted the use of these offices.” Nehra said that the government entity had not paid its dues, the AMC was forced to resort to sealing them.

AMC, for drainage and water services given to these government establishments, collects a service charge in lieu of property tax. The AMC even gives government entities a 25% discount on their bills. A senior officer said that the issue of service charge had been contest up to the Supreme Court and the apex court had ruled in favour of the corporation and authorized it to levy service charges.

Officials service charge bills are also issued to the railways for all its properties, including the station and railway staff quarters. Similarly, the police are charged for all police stations and other properties.

The official said that the railway had refused to accept the AMC’s bill and a fresh survey of railway properties was done in 2012. Ever since, the railways have not been paying their dues, which has added up to Rs 14 crore.

PDPU to rope in oil companies to harness geothermal energy 

","
AHMEDABAD: After finding success in its pilot project at Dholera, Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University (PDPU) is planning to tap a large geothermal source for commercially viable production of electricity. For this, it is planning to rope in oil companies to carry out deep well drilling and exploration at various locations in Gujarat, said officials involved in the project. 

The state is now exploring geothermal renewable energy and it is ready to set up its first geothermal power plant of 10-20 kilowatt capacity.

 The plant will start operating next month at Dholera, where medium enthalpy heat in the form of hot springs has been found under the earth. This is ideal for generating electricity, PDPU officials said. 

PDPU is now aiming to tap geothermal energy by drilling Gujarat’s first ‘parametric’ well at Dholera. For this, it is preparing an environment impact assessment study after the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) recently set the terms of reference. 

The Centre of Excellence for Geothermal Energy, (CEGE), a part of PDPU and funded by the Gujarat government, is coordinating the initiative which includes the Rs 13 crore project that aims to drill wells to depths of 1,500 metres at Dholera. The state government had established CEGE in October 2013 to generate large scale electricity. 

“The aim is to produce megawatt scale electricity,” said Manan Shah, faculty – School of Petroleum Technology and scientist at CEGE. “Unlike solar and wind energy, geothermal energy is available round the clock. The geothermal energy potential in India is about 10,000 MW and it has remained untapped so far,” he said. “CEGE has performed extensive exploration activities in Gujarat and identified 17 sweet spots among which Dholera is one of the most promising. We are the first in the country to initiate an attempt to generate electricity with the help of geothermal energy. We are happy that the ministry of new and renewable energy has extended support to upscale the pilot project,” said Anirbid Sircar, head of CEGE. 

Initially, six sites including Dholera, Unai, Gandhar, Tuwa, Chabsar and Tulsishyam were identified by CEGE. However, CEGE is currently focusing on three sites — Dholera, Gandhar and Unai for exploration activities. Two geothermal borewells were drilled at Dholera where the temperature of water was found to be 47-60 degrees celsius. The hot water of the well will be used for power generation using a technique termed as Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). CEGE has also joined hands with French firm ENOGIA to arrange the ORC unit to be brought to India this month. Plans are also afoot to tap abandoned ONGC wells in Gandhar region where the temperatures are very high and suitable to generate megawatt scale geothermal power, said Shah.

Scientists find bacteria that can contain oil spill pollution 

","
AHMEDABAD: In a significant discovery that could go a long way in controlling oil spills in the sea, scientists of Goa-based National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) have identified marine bacteria that can degrade crude oil.





The find is a especially important for Gujarat, which handles nearly 80% of India’s crude oil import through the ports in Gulf of Kutch. India’s only Marine National Park is also situated in this gulf and a threat of oil spill always looms here.

Scientists identified this marine bacillus specie near the coast of Vadinar, which handles maximum crude imports. In layman’s terms, this bacteria degrades or breaks down the chain of hydrocarbons in the spilt oil, thus making it easy to clear it from the sea and dispose it.

“Universally, oil spills produce enormous public anxiety and highlight the need for cost-effective, indigenous and environmentally acceptable bioremediation technologies. In recent times, advanced remedial techniques have been opted, such as solidifying, skimming, controlled burning and bio-remediation,” said the study titled ‘Biodegradation of Crude Oil Using Marine Bacillus Species from Vadinar Coast, Gujarat, India’.

Among seven isolates, scientists chose three bacterial strains for crude oil and petroleum hydrocarbon (PHC) degradation, which were thoroughly analysed using various methods.

“The overall results indicate that the studied bacterial isolates can prevent the contamination of oilpolluted areas in future. The present study shows that bacillus species with efficient emulsification activity, drop collapse test and oil spreading assay can be used for marine oil bioremediation,” the study noted. The study was conducted by Najmuddin Mulani, Abhay B Fulke, Edna D’Souza, Anirudh Ram, Aayushi Maloo, Faraz Sayed and SN Gajbhiye of CSIR-National Institute of Oceanography, regional centre in Mumbai.

Besides containing oil pollution in marine waters, the immobilized lipase (chemical catalysts) isolated from the bacterial strains can also be used for commercial applications. In recent past, an oil tanker MT Genessa carrying 30,000 tonnes of high-speed diesel had caught fire near Kandla port in January 2018, raising serious fear of the petroleum spilling in the sea. However, there was no spill.

Cept University student’s project in top eight at US contest 

","
AHMEDABAD: With summer growing in strength, the temperature in Ahmedabad on Thursday crossed 40 degrees celsius. And with air-conditioners being turned on, the worry of power bills shooting up is pressing on the minds of many.





“About 40%-50% of the electricity bill is caused by the cooling system in a country like India, where coolers and air-conditioners become a necessity. It was the starting point for us to think about ways to cut down on bills by both improving the building designs and devising ways to make air-conditioning (AC) efficient,” said Anmol Mathur, an MTech student of Building Energy Performance course at Faculty of Technology of Cept University, who is one of the team members of the Aatral Homes project.

The team has participated in the Solar Decathlon Design Challenge 2019 organised by USA Department of Energy under the banner of ‘Kill Bill Vol. 3’ where they have emerged in the final eight teams globally. Finals of the contest will take place in the second week at Colorado.

The team looks at accelerated construction activity in India as a huge opportunity. “Our effort is to create net-zero energy houses where energy is optimally used. In our hot and arid climate, we have to keep in mind factors such as size of the building, orientation and size of the windows, building material and so on. It can reduce the load on the AC,” said Prasad Vaidya, another team member.

The team claimed that their methods don’t increase costs of a building. 

Moreover, they can get additional benefit by installing solar panels on roofs.

PUBG ban to lapse in Ahmedabad 

","
AHMEDABAD: After instating a blanket ban on the online and mobile game PUBG (Player Unknown's Battlegrounds) on March 14, city police has climbed down and decided to let the ban lapse, after getting flak from the public and witnessing vehement protests on social media against the cops’ restriction of individual liberty.


Sources in Ahmedabad police said the decision to ban PUBG was taken after the home department instructed police commissioners and district magistrates across Gujarat to do so. The state home department sent out the instructions after it was approached by the education department, which sought action against youth and children who play PUBG.

Ahmedabad police commissioner A K Singh had on March 13 issued a notification banning PUBG and what it called the “MoMo challenge game”, claiming that players develop violent tendencies by playing these. Significantly, the MoMo challenge has been reported to be an internet and social media hoax, and not a real “game”. “These games adversely affect the nature, behaviour, communication and development of children and youth,” the Ahmedabad police notification announcing the two-week ban on March 14 had claimed.

After the ban, at least 20 people across Gujarat were arrested for playing PUBG and booked under IPC Section 188 of the IPC (violating an order of a government servant). However, the police department came in for severe criticism, for prohibiting a mobile game rather than focusing on law and order issues.

One day after it had banned the game, city police tweeted that they would review the ban as it had drawn diverse reactions from citizens. On whether the ban would be renewed, Singh told TOI, “We will most likely not renew the notification. As we are yet to process the issue on file and consult the government. As the directions had come from the home department and these were state-wide instructions, we must also get the benefit of the state’s decision or review. However, we are less likely to renew it.”

On whether any survey had been conducted before the ban was announced, Singh said, “There has not been any proper scientific study conducted, but there is a lot of anecdotal evidence.” A senior police official said that as cops had started booking people, most of them youth, for playing PUBG, but it sent out a negative message to the people. “We booked people for a couple of days but realized that this exercise would not help anyone, and so we stopped filing cases,” said an Ahmedabad police official.

Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation tries to seal college while exams are on 

","
AHMEDABAD: If you have defaulted in paying your annual property tax for even a year, taxmen from the civic body will not think twice before they seal your home or establishment.

Advocate accuses man of rape by using promise of marriage 

","
AHMEDABAD: A 42-year-old woman advocate of Metropolitan Court filed a complaint of rape on Thursday against a man who had promised to marry her.

The complainant, a resident of Vejalpur, stated in her FIR with Madhavpura police that she had divorced in 2017 and started practising criminal cases in Gheekanta court.

As she was in search of a groom, she consulted with her friends and relatives. In October 2018, her friend, Dipak Vaja introduced her to a man named, Dinesh Prajapati, a resident of Kutch and an employee of Employment Information Centre in Kutch University. Prajapati also sent his bio-data to the complainant wishing to marry her.

After talking on phone, she first met him in November 2018 at Gujarat Club where they discussed marriage plans. “On January 13, Prajapati asked the complainant to meet him at a garden in Ellisbridge area wherein he molested her. When the complainant became angry, he told her that he was just trying to be funny,” said the FIR.

Again on January 24, the accused took the complainant to Sabarmati riverfront in the afternoon where he forcibly kissed her and molested her, stated the FIR. The complainant alleged that the accused, whenever he met her, molested her, while assuring her of marriage.

On March 24, Prajapati again asked the complainant to meet her at a room of a guesthouse in Shahibaug area of the city run by a religious sect. Prajapati told the complainant that he wanted to discuss something with her, but when she reached there, he started molesting her.

“When I told him that we should not indulge into sexual relationship before marriage, he pushed me on the bed saying that he would certainly marry me and then raped me,” stated the complainant.

“When the complainant asked him to say when he would marry her, he promised her that he would marry her on Thursday (March 28). But when she contacted her on Thursday, he refused to marry her,” stated the FIR.

After this, the woman approached Madhavpura police and filed a complaint of molestation and rape against Prajapati.

Ahmedabad carmaker made to pay Rs 2.5 lakh 

","
AHMEDABAD: A consumer court here has ordered an automobile company to pay Rs 2.5 lakh as compensation to the owner of a car after its airbag did not deploy during an accident.

The case involved Abhaykumar Jain of Sabarmati, who bought a premium hatch-back car in 2010. While it was still under warranty, the car met with an accident. On July 12, 2011, it hit a stone and turned turtle. The insurance company paid Jain Rs 2.75 lakh towards total loss of the vehicle.

However, Jain wanted the manufacturer and dealer to either refund the full vehicle price or replace the car. He approached the Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum, Ahmedabad (additional) contending that the vehicle was defective and its thus airbag did not deploy during the accident. He had also sought compensation of Rs 35,000 for mental agony and legal expenses.

While the car manufacturer did not accept the court’s notice, its local dealer opposed the complaint and maintained that there could be many reasons for the airbag not deploying. Jain himself was not in the car so he cannot say whether the driver was using the seatbelt. The deployment of an automotive airbag also depends on the speed of the vehicle.

The dealer also took exception to the opinion of the surveyor, who was a mechanical engineer. It claimed that only an automobile engineer can give a definite opinion on why the airbag did not deploy. The surveyor concluded that the airbag did not deploy due to a manufacturing defect in the vehicle.

The consumer court said that in the absence of the opinion of an automobile engineer on why the airbag did not deploy, the reason for the malfunction cannot be established. It said that the manufacturing defect in car could not be proved and there was no question of replacing the vehicle or a refund of its cost. It was established on the basis of the panchnama and documentary evidence that the airbag did not deploy during the accident. This malfunction had also happened in the warranty period. This reflected an unfair trade practice by the company. The court said the company should pay Rs 2 lakh as compensation and Rs 50,000 extra for mental agony caused and legal expenses.

Blow to Hardik Patel poll plans as Gujarat HC refuses to stay conviction 

","
AHMEDABAD: Hardik Patel, the Patidar quota warrior, got a jolt from the Gujarat high court on Friday when it rejected his application seeking a stay on his two-year conviction in a rioting case. Patel wanted the stay to contest in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. Gujarat votes on April 23.





With Justice A G Uraizee turning down his plea, it is going to be a race against time for Patel who joined the Congress in the presence of the party’s president, Rahul Gandhi, on March 12. Patel’s only hope now is to challenge the high court’s order in the Supreme Court to get legal sanction to file his nomination. April 4 is the last date for filing nominations for candidates in Gujarat. This means Patel has only four working days, till 3pm on Thursday.

“Hardik will file a plea in the Supreme Court in line with Kapil Sibal’s advice,” said Jayesh Patel, a close aide of Hardik. “He will canvass against the BJP in Gujarat and across India if he does not get the legal nod to file his nomination.”

Patel tweeted after the verdict that he is not afraid and will actively campaign for the Congress, which has pitched him as a star campaigner.


Blames BJP for his fate

My only fault is that I refused to bow down to the BJP,” Patel tweeted. “Elections may come and go but the BJP is working against the Constitution.” He also wrote: “Why is the BJP stopping a 25-year-old Congress candidate from fighting the election? Many BJP leaders have legal cases and convictions against them. Why is the law only for us?”

Patel’s advocate Salim Saiyed said that approaching the Supreme Court would be considered after going through the high court’s order.

Gujarat Congress president Amit Chavda said that the party would provide all legal support to Patel. “The party has, however, prepared a panel of likely candidates for replacement — if that becomes necessary,” he said.

Cops crack down on stores unsafe for women 

","
AHMEDABAD: City police have cracked down on malls and showrooms following two cases of alleged voyeurism at such establishments recently. Vastrapur police even sealed a bookstore, where a man had tried to film a nine-year-old girl using the toilet. A clothing store where a staffer had allegedly tried to peep into a changing room when a 40-year-old woman was trying on clothes was also sealed.


P L Mal, DCP Zone 1, said the showroom and bookstore were sealed as investigations are underway in these two cases of alleged voyeurism.

“Apart from these two places, Vastrapur police also slapped notices on three malls for lack of measures to keep women safe,” said Inspector M M Jadeja of Vastrapur police.

M B Jhala, an inspector at Satellite police station, said cops inspected all malls in Satellite and briefed managers and staffers on precautions against voyeurism. “We directed malls and showrooms to put up partitions between changing rooms for men and women and to deploy only women staffers near changing rooms for women,” said Jhala. 

Police swung into action after city police commissioner A K Singh directed commercial establishments to take measures to ensure the safety of women. The circular says that women’s washrooms and trial rooms should be built in a way that nobody can peep in, take pictures or record videos.

Last week, a city doctor had filed a complaint in Vastrapur, alleging that a showroom worker had tried to peep into a trial room when his wife was trying on clothes. On Monday, a 26-year-old man was nabbed by Vastrapur police for allegedly recording a video of a nine-year-old girl when she was using the toilet at a bookstore.

Gujarat HC tells GPCB to survey mining activities 

","
AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Friday ordered the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) to conduct a survey of mining activities in Jamnagar district and take action against mining lessees not following environmental rules.

According to Vikas Nair, the advocate for the petitioner, the high court sought a report from GPCB on the survey of mining activities by April 22, when a further hearing is posted.

The HC directions came in connection with a petition filed by villager from Miyatra, Bahadursinh Jhala, complaining about pollution caused by two Jamnagar-based companies, Sarvodaya Jahaj Enterprise and Krishna Enterprise, which operate mines near the village. The petitioner complained that the companies extract black trap mineral from the land near his village and do not follow pollution rules, which create problems for villagers.The petitioner urged the high court to restrain the companies from extracting the mineral from the land of Miyatra’s revenue survey No. 42, because it adversely affects the local biodiversity and agricultural produce. He also demanded that GPCB be directed to inspect the sites and submit a report on the health of farmers in Miyatra village. When the high court sought replies from the companies, they contended that there were many other mining operations in the region which also do not follow pollution rules. This led the high court to order GPCB to carry out a survey of mining activity in the district and to act against those violating the Environment Act.

Decentralize power to make the poor less vulnerable, says Ela Bhatt 

","
AHMEDABAD: The key to making the poor less vulnerable is the decentralization of governance and development, said Gujarat Vidyapith chancellor Ela Bhatt. Speaking during a discussion organized as part of a conference on nation building by the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) on Thursday, she said the major challenges for the rural population is rising debt, the greater need for cash and the lack of opportunities to better their lives and livelihoods.

“Poverty in numbers is not increasing. But the poor people’s vulnerability is increasing. The speed with which their income grows does not match that of inflation. What needs to be done is decentralizing of power and resources,” Bhatt said. “It is important to identify how we cut down the distance between producer and consumer and how we cut the distance between government and people. People must be brought closer to three basic needs of food, clothing and shelter and three primary services of healthcare, education and banking,” she added. According to Bhatt, this will help bring about a circular economy. “This will help boost purchasing power of consumers, particularly women,” she added.

2008 blasts case to be tried in-camera 

","
AHMEDABAD: One decade after the case for the serial blasts in the city in 2008 began, the special court has barred the entry of persons other than advocates involved with the case in the courtroom and decided to conduct proceedings in-camera.





 Special judge A R Patel ordered the in-camera trial citing the need to ensure the security of the lives of secret witnesses and their relatives, after the state government expressed apprehensions in this regard. There are 26 secret witnesses in this case and many of them have already deposed. The court ordered that only lawyers representing the prosecution and defence be allowed in the courtroom. Even the investigating officers and court staff will be allowed to enter only if their presence is needed. The court invoked its powers under Section 44 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).

On March 25, the head of the investigation team asked the court to hold the trial in-camera. He expressed fear that the lives of secret witnesses and their relatives could be in danger in the future because persons not involved in the case remain present in the courtroom while witnesses depose.

The judge agreed to the proposal saying, “The court has also noticed that while secret witnesses depose many people including women remain present in the courtroom. The prosecution’s request that necessary steps should be taken to protect the lives of secret witnesses and their relatives in the future hence appears fair and reasonable.”

The court further said, “Proceedings have taken place in open court through video-conferencing, but when the question of the security of witnesses and their relatives arises, it is the court’s duty to ensure that their lives are not put in danger and the secret witnesses’ identities are not revealed in society.”

More than a decade ago, a magisterial court had ordered in-camera proceedings when the accused persons’ remand applications were being heard.

On July 26, 2008, 19 bombs had rocked the city, killing 56 persons and leaving more than 200 injured. Nearly 80 persons have been facing trial in this case for the last 10 years.

‘India’s milk output to double in 10 years’ 

","
AHMEDABAD: India’s milk production is set to double over the next 10 years to 100 crore litres per day, from the current 43 crore litres a day, said R S Sodhi, managing director of Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) on Thursday. Sodhi was addressing a panel discussion in the city on ‘Industry as Nation Builders for New India’ organized by Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) – Western Region.

“Of the current production of 43 crore litres per day, the organized sector only produces some 9 crore litres. The production by the organized sector will also increase to 30 crore litres per day, during this 10-year period,” said Sodhi. “This means that the organized dairy industry in India has a potential to create some 1.2 crore jobs over the next 10 years.”

Sodhi said the challenge is to modernize the dairy sector. “Youth from rural areas often migrate to urban pockets in search of jobs. However, it is time to show them that there is enough opportunity in the rural India. The demand for dairy products is there and will remain. In fact, the dairy and food industry are growing at a double-digit rate. No other industry can guarantee a double-digit growth over next 40-50 years,” he said.

Talking to TOI about the role of the industry in creating these jobs, he said, “The support from industry as well as government is crucial in achieving this target of creating jobs. Industries must invest in processing and marketing of dairy products, as it will help create jobs.”

Sodhi said, “At the same time, the government must also focus on providing support to the landless and marginal farmers who are at the core of the dairy sector. The budgetary allocation for livestock sector must increase significantly.”

Experts present during the panel discussion also spoke about the need to make the youth employable. “Some 2,000 engineering institutions churning out thousands of engineer still teach technology that was relevant ten years ago. They do not teach technologies of future. They’re not even entrepreneurial. If you got to create employment, you got to be updated. This is an absolute national emergency,” said Sunil Mathur, managing director and CEO, Siemens Ltd, who was also present at the discussion.

Top BSF officer reviews security in Kutch 

","
AHMEDABAD: After the Pulwama terror attack, security has been tightened and more personnel deployed by the Border Security Force on the Indo-Pak border areas of Kutch. On Thursday, Deputy DGP, BSF (Western Command) Surendra Rao chaired a review meeting of security arrangements in vulnerable areas including Sir Creek, Harami Nala and Narayan Sarovar. Rao had arrived in Kutch on Wednesday.

Border security in Kutch has been a priority especially after the Pulwama attack. Since then, two Pakistanis have been arrested by BSF from border areas. A convoy was attacked in Pulwama in J&K by terrorist outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed leading to the deaths of 40 CRPF jawans in February. Also reports of the presence of Chinese troops close to the border, ostensibly to guard their ongoing mining projects in Tharparkar desert region in Sindh province in Pakistan and Chinese employees working at the site, has made the situation more sensitive, said senior BSF officials. Recently, Chinese authorities made news by destroying 30,000 maps that showed Arunachal Pradesh as part of India.

A senior BSF official said Tharparkar is roughly 90 kilometres away from the international border between India and Pakistan. The region is reportedly witnessing heightened activity by Jamat-Ud-Dawa, a new identity assumed by Pakistan-based terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba. 

Various infrastructure projects are being carried out in Pakistan as part of the multi-billion-dollar China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) that runs about 3,000 kilometers. 

“Under CPEC, many mining projects are going on in the Tharparkar region. To safeguard these projects, Chinese troops have been deployed. In wake of this, we have also enhanced BSF deployment in the areas,” said top state police officials.

Vehicles, batteries, wires and other appliances were gutted,” said Shaikh, adding that reason of fire is not known.

Water-tankers from Gandhinagar municipality and GIDC were also called in and even an Air Force vehicle was also called in to control the fire, said Shaikh. tnn

Foreigners Act: Russian woman assures Gujarat HC of not entering India without valid visa 

","
AHMEDABAD: Anastasiia Leonskaia, the Russian woman, who is facing charges of illegal entry and overstaying, gave an undertaking to the Gujarat high court on Thursday that if she is allowed to leave the country, she would never return India without a valid visa.


Last week, the high court had asked her to give an undertaking that she would not violate the law in future when Leonskaia’s advocate Nachiket Dave insisted that since no offence was found against her during her various stays in India, she should be granted an exit permit or deported so that she could re-join her 7-year-old daughter Maitino Stefania in Irkutsk City.

The 38-year-old woman along with her infant son has been requesting for exit permit after she realised that her daughter’s caretaker had passed away and she might be sent to an orphanage. 

After she moved the HC following no-response from the Foreign Registration Regional Office (FRRO) on her request for exit permit twice, she received a letter from the guardianship authority from her native town that if she did not return, her daughter would be sent to an orphanage.

After she moved the HC, the FRRO registered an FIR with the city crime branch against Leonskaia accusing her of entering India in December 2016 illegally from Nepal and violating provisions of the Foreigners Act.

Apprehensive of her daughter being placed in an orphanage, Leonskaia once again told the court that she was ready to give an undertaking, if the high court ordered the authorities to grant her exit permit or to deport her.

In an undertaking she filed in the high court, Leonskaia said, “If I am given Exit Permit and/or deported from India, I shall never re-enter into India without a valid visa.” She has agreed to give her bio-metric data to the Indian agencies and to abide by all the conditions imposed by the high court. 

Justice Sonia Gokani posted further hearing on Monday, when the authorities would reply to Leonskaia’s undertaking.

Ahmedabad trader cheated of Rs 57 lakh 

","
AHMEDABAD: A resident of Bodakdev who is a trader of electronic appliances on Gandhi Road, on Thursday filed a complaint with Kalupur police stating that he was cheated of Rs 57 lakh by another trader, who he paid the money to for a stock of ceiling fans and table fans.

Navin Khanduja (32), a resident of Goyal Park near Judges’ Bungalows in Bodakdev, in his FIR at Kalupur police station, stated that has an electronics and electrical appliances shop near Bala Hanuman temple on Gandhi Road. Ten years ago Khanduja met one Kaushal Bhavsar, a resident of Nirnaynagar, as he was in the same business. Khanduja was a retailer while Bhavsar was a wholesaler of table and ceiling fans. “In July 2018, Khanduja told Bhavsar he needed a large quantity of fans. Bhavsar told him to pay in advance as he would also need to get stock from another trader. As Khanduja trusted Bhavsar, he gave him Rs 56.65 lakh between July 2018 and February 2019. When Khanduja asked Bhavsar about his stock, he kept avoiding him. When Khanduja enquired with the third trade, he learned that Bhavsar has not paid a single rupee to the trader,” the FIR states. After this, Khanduja approached Kalupur police and registered an FIR against Bhavsar for cheating and breach of trust.

Gujarat ATS seizes 100kg heroin from Pakistani boat off Porbandar coast, 9 arrested 

","
AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS), in a joint operation with the Indian Coast Guard (ICG), early on Wednesday morning nabbed nine Iranian crew members and seized 100 kilograms of heroin, estimated to be worth Rs 500 crore, after intercepting their dhow off Porbandar coast in Gujarat while they were trying to smuggle the narcotic to India.


The midnight operation in the deep seas saw the ICG and ATS officials engage in a long chase of the Pakistan-made dhow off Porbandar coast. Staring at an impeding arrest, the alleged smugglers set their own dhow ablaze to destroy the evidence. The Gujarat ATS officers, however, nabbed the nine Iranians in the sea as the dhow sank. The ATS officials have also identified two brothers from Porbandar who were to be delivered the consignment.

ATS officials on Wednesday said that the ICG vessel had brought the nine Iranian crew members to Probandar ICG jetty where they are being interrogated. The Gujarat coast it seems is becoming a regular infiltration route for Pakistani smugglers, said a senior ATS official.

Earlier this year, 1500 kg heroin was seized by ICG along the Gujarat coast. ""This is the second instance in the last one year where Gujarat ATS has seized such a large quantity of heroin in Gujarat,"" the official said.

Sanju Samson scores first century of IPL 2019 

","
NEW DELHI: Sanju Samson turned the heat on Sunrises Hyderabad with the first century of the 2019 Indian Premier League (IPL) season, which powered Rajasthan Royals to 198/2 after they elected to bat first in the eighth match of IPL-12 at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal, Hyderabad, on Friday. However, Samson's effort remained futile as the hosts went on to win the match by five wickets. 



IPL Schedule | 
IPL Points Table

Samson's second century of IPL came off just 54 balls as the 24-year-old batsman, who hails from Kerala, finished with unbeaten 102 off 55 balls -- studded with 10 fours and four sixes. 

His first century of IPL came in 2017 for his former team Delhi Daredevils in the match against Rising Pune Supergiants. Incidentally, he scored 102 in that innings as well.

""It feels good to score an IPL hundred, but this is just the start of the tournament and I got to stay grounded and do what the team wants,"" Samson said during the innings break while speaking to the broadcasters. 

""The pitch was a bit slow to start with, but with time it got easy. I think we have set a good target with our bowling line-up. But cricket is a funny game, anything can happen,"" he added.

Opening the batting, RR skipper Ajinkya Rahane led from the front with 49-ball 70 and together with Samson shared 119 runs for the second wicket to set the base for the total after the early dismissal of Jos Buttler.

Rajasthan's decision to bat first didn't go according to plan, at least in the powerplay, as the visitors struggled against Sunrisers' disciplined bowling to garner just 35 runs in the first six overs.

After Buttler's dismissal, skipper Rahane was joined at the crease by Samson and the duo played cautiously without taking any undue risk to take Rajasthan forward.

Rahane registered his first fifty of this season in 38 balls while Samson brought up his half-century in 34 deliveries as the duo raised 100-run stand for the second wicket in 65 balls.

Sunrisers' successful run-chase was led by openers David Warner (69 off 37) and Jonny Bairstow (45 off 28), who stitched an opening partnership of 110 runs to lay a solid platform.

The home team went on to achieve the target with an over to spare. They finished with 201/5 for their first win of the season, after losing the opening match to Kolkata Knight Riders.

barcelona: Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez fit to start 'fundamental' week for Barcelona 

","
BARCELONA: Lionel Messi has overcome a groin injury while strike partner Luis Suarez has sufficiently recovered from a sprained ankle to play in this weekend's derby against Espanyol, Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde said on Friday.


Messi and Suarez were included in the squad of 18 ahead of Saturday's La Liga game at the Camp Nou. Ousmane Dembele is still absent, suffering from a thigh problem.

In his press conference, Valverde was cautious about Messi, who was forced to leave the Argentina squad last Sunday because of chronic groin pain.

Asked if his captain was 100 per cent, Valverde said: ""We think he is, but, hey, Leo has been carrying this problem for some time and we have been working to allow him to recover.""

""It flared up with his national team. He's had a rest and he is better. We'll be careful with Messi because of the fundamental importance of the matches.""

Suarez missed Uruguay's recent games after twisting his ankle but Valverde said ""the rest did him good.""

Valverde said he could not give a date for Dembele's return. The Catalans visit Manchester United on April 10 for the first leg of a Champions League quarterfinal.

Before then, Barca have three Spanish league games in eight days.

They go into Saturday's fixture 10 points ahead of second-place Atletico Madrid. On Tuesday, Valverde's men travel down the Mediterranean coast to face Villarreal and then entertain Atletico next weekend.

""We have in mind that it is a derby, which is motivating for us and for them,"" Valverde said.

""This week we have three League games and three difficult games. When you play for nine points in a week, at this stage of the season, it can be decisive.

""We know what we are playing this week.""

Chennaiyin beat Mumbai City to progress to the quarters of Super Cup 

","
BHUBANESWAR: Chennaiyin booked their place in the quarter-finals of the 2019 Hero Super Cup with a clinical 2-0 win over Mumbai City FC at the Kalinga Stadium here Friday.


CK Vineeth opened the scoring for Chennaiyin with a brilliant long-range curler in the 42nd minute.

Jeje Lalepkhlua almost instantly doubled the lead with a well-worked goal.

Mumbai City were toothless in attack as they failed to break down Chennaiyin's defence.

The match started on a cagey note with both sides battling it out in the midfield. Raynier Fernandes of Mumbai City and Isaac Vanmalsawma of Chennaiyin caused the most danger with their pace and trickery.

However, the first real opening of the game would fall to striker Jeje for Chennaiyin. The forward picked up the ball near the edge of the box. With Lucian Goian standing up to him, he created a yard of space for himself before firing a left-footed shot which went wide of the far post.

A few minutes later, Chennaiyin had another good opportunity to break the deadlock from a set-piece. Isaac's free-kick from just outside the box seemed to be heading for the back of the net, however Ravi Kumar was at hand to prevent it.

The Islanders failed to muster up any clear opportunities in the half, with Raynier Fernandes' long-range shot testing the palms of Karnajit Singh.

Just when it looked like the half would end goalless, Vineeth opened the scoring with a sumptuous finish. The 30-year-old found space outside the penalty box, turned and then fired a shot, which flew into the top corner.

Only a minute later, Jeje doubled Chennaiyin's lead with another neat finish. This time the Mizo sniper got on the end of a well-placed cross from Thoi Singh, before efficiently guiding the ball into the top corner, leaving the goalkeeper with no chance. With that, the Marina Machans entered the half with a healthy two goal lead.

John Gregory's unit were riding high on confidence with the lead and nearly scored a third within minutes of the second period.

Vineeth again threatened the Mumbai defenders with his clever movement. He managed to find a few yards of space from 25-yard-out before unleashing a fierce drive, which forced Ravi Kumar into a fine save.

Mumbai continued to struggle in the second half, failing to break down Chennaiyin's resolute defence. Goian came closest to pulling a goal back for Mumbai when his long-range attempt nearly creeped into the far post.

That proved to be the only notable attempt for Mumbai as the likes of Mailson Alves and Eli Sabia held their fort well to ensure that the South-Indian team finished with a clean sheet.

There is very less margin of error for bowlers against in-form David Warner: Ajinkya Rahane 

","
HYDERABAD: Rajasthan Royals skipper Ajinkya Rahane Friday admitted that it is very difficult for bowlers to defend any total against an opposition which has an in-form batsman like David Warner up their ranks.


Sanju Samson's (102 not out) second IPL ton was overshadowed by Warner's blistering fifty as Sunrisers Hyderabad beat Rajasthan by five wickets to register their first win in the ongoing IPL here.


POINTS TABLE | 
SCHEDULE

Samson's first century of the ongoing IPL went in vain, as chasing a mammoth 199-run target, Warner set up the platform with a breezy 69 off 37 balls and together with Jonny Bairstow (45 off 28) added a century stand for the opening wicket as Sunrisers chase down the score in 19 overs.

""I think first of all, we thought 190 plus was very good score. The wicket was stopping a bit and we were aiming to get 150 plus. But credit to Sunrisers for the momentum they got in the powerplay. When someone like Warner bats like that, it's very less margins for the bowler,"" Rahane said at the post-match presentation ceremony.

""They didn't lose momentum throughout. When he (Warner) got out, Vijay Shankar batted well too. Sanju's been fantastic for us. We all know how talented he is. I'm sure he's also hurt but he'll go miles. Consistency is the key for him,"" he added.

Sunrisers captain Kane Williamson credited Warner and Bairstow for setting up the platform for the win.

""It was a tough game, but Rajasthan Royals played really well. The openers set it up for us. It was a good collective effort. It certainly wasn't easy. There are some areas we want to touch up on. We needed many parts to fire to chase near 200 and it was a good experience for us,"" Williamson said.

Man-of-the-match Rashid Khan, who bowled an economical 1/24 spell and struck a four and six off Jofra Archer to finish off the chase, said he was happy with his performance.

""I just try my best to be positive in every game, in every department,"" he said.

Talking about Jos Buttler's dismissal, Rashid said: ""I think that was the plan (to Buttler) as I've got him early previously. So I just bowled in good areas and saw how it goes. I just tried my best to mix up my five leg-spinners.

""I realised it wasn't a wicket where there will be too much turn. Yes, I have five different leg-spins, with different actions and grip,"" he said.

Asked about his batting skill, the star Afghan cricketer said: ""My coaches have given me a lot of confidence in the nets that I'm capable of hitting it anywhere.""

PSG ready to wait for European success 

","
PARIS: They have won five of the last six Ligue 1 titles with very little competition on the domestic scene. But the French champions Paris Saint-Germain, even with all their big-ticket signings like Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, have not yet fulfilled their promise in the biggest stage in Europe, the Champions League. A fair bit of criticism has come their way after another disappointing exit in the Champions League this season after squandering their first-leg advantage against Manchester United in the Round of 16. But the PSG management is willing to bide its time to crack the code in the European scene. 

""PSG have taken the popularity of Ligue 1 to a different level. In Paris, we have the second largest pool of talent in the world after Sao Paulo, Brazil,"" Jean Martial Ribes, head of communication of PSG, told a group of visiting Indian media here on Wednesday. 

""This is good for us as well as French football. We still need to raise the level and we are working on that for Ligue 1. What we have done in the last seven years, in terms of building the brand, it is massive. We have won about 20 trophies. We are creating history here in France and we need time to do it in Europe,"" Ribes added. 

The takeover of the club by Qatar Sports Investment in 2011 has been a game-changer for PSG. 

""Before the takeover, our turnover was about 80 million euros, now it is about 560 million euros. We have 800 employees. We are catching up to the biggest clubs in Europe. We have spent 75 million euros to renovate Parc des Princes. We have 12000 kids playing in our academies. The reason QSI (Qatar Sports Investments) bought PSG was Paris is the only European capital with only one team. We don't share the spotlight with any other team,"" said Ribes. 

PSG plans to take it slowly in their foray into India also. 

""For us, the Indian market is very important. If you make it into the Indian market, the potential is massive. The problem is the game is really not developed yet. We are looking very closely at what the Indian clubs are doing and we will probably advance progressively. 

""We were in India (previously) but we did not find it easy to develop the academies. But for us, it is one of the top markets but not an easy one to break into. I think we need the right partners. We are also looking at Indian sponsors,"" added Ribes.

Looking to make Mohali our fortress: Craig McMillan 

","
MOHALI: The IS Bindra stadium was a happy hunting ground for hosts Kings XI Punjab, when they played here last year. They played four matches last year in Mohali and won all of them. Punjab’s fielding coach Craig McMillan believes they will make Mohali a happy hunting ground again.


“We are really looking forward to Saturday’s game because it is our first home match. Mohali was our fortress last year, we played some really good cricket here. Players are also excited to play here. We have been on the road the first two games,” said McMillan.

“I think home form is going to be very crucial for us to go all the way in the tournament. We are definitely looking to consolidate our home advantage,” he added. It has been a controversy-laden start for the Kings, having to endure a controversy involving their captain Ravichandran Ashwin who ‘Mankaded’ Rajasthan Royals batsman Jos Buttler in their tournament opener. When quizzed if that controversy has affected the team’s morale, McMillan said: “I don’t think it has any impact. It is a long tournament. We have moved on from the first game very quickly. Yes, we didn’t get the ideal result in Kolkata because they played better than us.”

UEFA probe ineligibility protests over Ukraine forward Junior Moraes 

","
PARIS: UEFA is investigating complaints from Luxembourg and Portugal that Ukraine fielded an ineligible player in Brazil-born Junior Moraes for their recent Euro 2020 qualifiers against the two countries, European football's governing body announced on Wednesday.


""Following a protest lodged by the Luxembourg Football Federation and the Portuguese Football Federation, disciplinary proceedings have been instigated... in relation to the eligibility of Ukraine's player Junior Moraes in the above-mentioned matches,"" UEFA said in a statement.

Attacker Moraes made his Ukraine debut as a substitute in Friday's goalless Group B draw with Portugal after receiving citizenship from the country a few days previously.

He made his first start for Andriy Shevchenko's side in Monday's 2-1 win over Luxembourg.

The 31-year-old has played most of the past seven years in Ukraine, this year for Shakhtar Donetsk.

FIFA rules state that for players to acquire a nationality they have to live continuously in the country for five years, and Portuguese media claims he does not meet this criteria due to his spell in China in 2017.

Group B leaders Ukraine risk losing all four points earned and forfeiting both games if Moraes is judged ineligible.

I was playing cricket in my backyard as an eight year old when IPL started: Sam Curran 

","
NEW DELHI: England all-rounder Sam Curran was eight years old when the maiden season of Indian Premier League (IPL) was played in 2008. Curran, like any other youngster, dreaming of becoming a cricketer, would watch star players on television, hitting the ball out of the park, uprooting stumps and showcasing some great athleticism on the field.

IPL Points Table

Curran, now 20, is part of IPL 2019. On the back of an impressive Test series against India last year, Curran entered the player auction as one of the hot picks.

When Curran's name was called out by the auctioneer, there was an intense bidding war for the England all-rounder. 

Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab both tried to buy the England star, but it was Punjab who emerged victorious in the end and won the bid. 

Curran in fact became the most expensive overseas player after Punjab paid a whopping Rs. 7.20 crore to buy the 20-year-old. 

Excited to be a part of the Punjab side, Curran, in an exclusive interview with Timesofindia.com, spoke about playing his maiden IPL season, KXIP's title-winning chances, captain Ravichandran Ashwin and his ICC World Cup 2019 selection chances.


Excerpts...


How excited are you to be playing your maiden IPL season?

I am really excited to be part of the IPL. I have been watching it for a long time. It is an amazing tournament. I am really looking forward to playing some good cricket and sharing the dressing room with the best players in the world. 


How do you view the KXIP team having watched it on TV over the years?

Punjab have a talented bunch of boys. It is a well-balanced side. I have shared net sessions with these players. I am sure I will learn a lot from players around the world. We have a great captain in Ashwin. He is a good leader. He did well for KXIP last year and I am sure he will guide KXIP to the title this year.





You were just eight years old when IPL started in 2008. What were you doing back then?

I was playing cricket with my father in the backyard of my house when IPL started (laughs). I was learning the game at that point of time. I was watching big stars hitting the ball, taking wickets and doing some great fielding on the television screen. 


With KL Rahul, Chris Gayle, Ashwin, Shami and you in the team, KXIP look like a well-balanced side. How do you rate the team's chances this year?
With Gayle and Rahul at the top, we have a great batting attack. Gayle is unstoppable when on fire. We have a decent bowling attack too. The middle order also looks strong. It is a well-balanced side. Ashwin is a good leader and the chances for KXIP looks bright. We want to take (it) one game at a time. 


England will be playing the ICC World Cup 2019 at home. How do you see their title winning chances? 

Yes definitely. There is amazing one-day cricket being played by England. The way England are playing in ODIs, the chances are bright. England playing at home are a strong side and hope they have better luck in the World Cup. England have a bunch of talented players and I wish they carry on the same show in the World Cup. They should take (it) one game at a time and win. It will be amazing if they lift the title in front of the home crowd. 


You have represented England in two ODIs so far. Do you think you will make it to the England squad for the World Cup?

It's a dream for every player to represent his country in the World Cup. I also want to represent my country in the mega tournament. For now, I am focusing on IPL. I want to give my best.

Lionel Messi upset with criticism from Argentina fans 

","
BUENOS AIRES: Argentina star Lionel Messi admitted Friday to being upset with constant criticism in his homeland, saying in an interview that even his 6-year-old son asks why his countrymen attack his performances for the national team.


Many Argentinans feel Messi doesn't have the same enthusiasm for international soccer that he does for his club Barcelona.

They also questioned his silence after being eliminated from last year's World Cup by France, something Messi said he wanted to forget.

``I wanted to distance myself from the team, let time go by and cool myself. It was painful to end the cycle this way,'' Messi said.

``Many people said I should not return (to the national team). Family, friends. My 6-year-old (asked me) `Why do they kill you in Argentina, daddy?'''

The 31-year-old Argentina captain said he still wants to win a tournament and will keep trying with the team under coach Lionel Scaloni.

``Those that don't like me will have to stand me a little longer,'' Messi said, adding he had already achieved ``extraordinary things'' with Argentina, including ``a World Cup final, two Copa America finals, and that is not easy.''

The five-time Ballon D'Or winner said he doesn't need to say he loves Argentina ``in every instant'' because he expresses his passion for his home nation ``in another way.''

Messi also denied he decides who plays for the national team.

``We have heard about this `club of friends' thing for years. They say I pick the players, the coaches. I basically manage the whole AFA (Argentina's soccer association),'' he ironically said.

Messi pointed out that average Argentinians are kind with him whenever he visits the South American country.

``I get upset that people are lied to,'' Messi said.

The striker insisted his absence in Argentina's 1-0 victory in a friendly against Morocco in Tangier on Tuesday was due to injury.

``I have a groin injury since the break in December and I have trained less, I haven't played all the matches,'' he said.

Before the win, Argentina lost to Venezuela 3-1 in Madrid in a friendly that marked Messi's return.

Scaloni said after that match that Messi will surely play in this year's Copa America, June 14 to July 7 in Brazil.

SRH vs RR, IPL 2019: Samson's ton goes in vain as Warner, Bairstow hand Sunrisers Hyderabad first win of the season 

","
HYDERABAD: Rajasthan Royals, on Friday night, who had lost the first game, found themselves up against a team against whom they had lost four of their five games – Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH). In fact, SRH had won the last three encounters, including both games last season, and have an enviable record at the RGIC Stadium – having won 15 of their 21 games since 2016.
 


IPL Schedule | IPL Points Table | Scorecard
Royals needed to come up with something special to get their campaign on track. Sanju Samson produced a magical innings as he tore the Sunrisers bowling to shreds on way to a belligerent century (102, 55b, 10x4, 4x6). With skipper Ajinkya Rahane (70; 49b, 4x4, 3x6) playing a well-calculated innings, Royals ended up with 198 for two. The Royals went into the break believing that they had done enough to get their first points of the season.

However, the hosts had other ideas as they carved out a five–wicket win to keep their citadel intact. The man who looks ‘like David but hits like Goliath’ showed why he is the most dangerous batsman in the world. David Warner came out all guns blazing as he toyed with the Royals attack to make a mockery of the challenge.



The opener struck Dhawal Kulkarni for a boundary off the first ball to make his intentions clear. There was no stopping the pocket dynamite as Sunrisers raced to 69 at the end of the powerplay with Warner getting 52 of those off just 27 balls. Jonny Bairstow too joined the party and the Sunrisers cruised past the 100-run mark in the ninth over.



Royals hung in grimly for the break and it came when Stokes induced Warner (69; 37b, 9x4, 2x6) to pull a short ball down Kulkarni’s throat. Two balls later, Kulkarni muffed up a chance offered by Bairstow. Kulkarni, however, made amends in the next over by catching Bairstow (44; 28b, 6x4, 1x6) off Shreyas Gopal.



At the end of the 13th over, Sunrisers were 136 for two and needed 63 off 42 balls. The Royals fancied a comeback but Vijay Shankar took over as he smoked three sixes and a four in a 15-ball 35 before falling to Gopal. The leg spinner trapped Manish Pandey leg before off the next ball to peg the Sunrisers’ charge. Yusuf Pathan (16) and Rashid Khan (15) completed the formalities in the 19th over as the hosts replied with 201 for five.

Earlier, Rahane won the toss and had no hesitation in batting first but the start that they envisioned didn’t take place. Rahane struggled to get on top of the bowlers as the SRH kept a tight leash on the scoring.

Revealed: The origins of Rusev Day 

","
While the Bulgarian Brute Alexander Rusev was tearing it down at NXT, it was evident that the Miroslav Barnyashev was destined for bigger things in the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). He eventually made his main roster debut and went undefeated for over a year including high-profile programs with John Cena, spots with The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin. He even held the United States Championship for 146 days. 


However, the WWE’s mould of foreign heel was running out of gas for Rusev. He needed something more, something different to not fall off the radar, which he did owning to injuries, bad storylines before being resurrected by 
Rusev Day and with Aiden English for company, Rusev has become one of the most popular wrestlers today. It has led him to his first WWE championship match against none other than AJ Styles at Extreme Rules this coming Sunday. 

TOI caught up with the Bulgarian during an international media call as he talked about the origins of 
Rusev Day, his preparations for the title match and his pick for the FIFA World Cup 2018. 


Excerpts: 

How did Rusev Day come about? The original Rusev Day started on Total Divas actually. We celebrated any day on Total Divas and that was first ever Rusev Day and after that with Randy Orton it build up (a segment after Rusev’s win over Randy Orton in October. It was a record eight-second win) and then Aiden English ran with it and we are here. 


Any pressure to live up to the hype of the match against AJ Styles? I am really looking forward to the match, not because I am competing for the WWE heavyweight title for the first time but because of the reputation Styles has. For years, he is known as the best in the world and I am confident that I am the best in the world as well so I would love to go head to head with him and finally face him and show the world that I am as good as I think I am. 


Your pick to win for the FIFA World Cup 2018 I would like to say Croatia because they are neighbours.

Messi haunted by failures but retirement still long way off 

","
BUENOS AIRES: Lionel Messi says he constantly replays Argentina's 2014 World Cup final defeat in his head but has vowed that a recent international sabbatical was a one-off and he has no plans to retire in the near future.


The Barcelona striker, speaking on an Argentine radio station on Friday, also surprised listeners by saying he misses Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who left rivals Real Madrid for Juventus last year.

""I miss Cristiano in Spain,"" Messi told Radio C5N. ""It was lovely having him here, even though it annoyed me seeing him win so many titles. It would be great if he was still here.""

Messi, a five-time Ballon d'Or winner, has begun 2019 in fine form with his Barcelona side running away with La Liga and through to the Champions League quarter-finals.

He also returned to international action last week in a lacklustre 3-1 defeat by Venezuela, a game that was his first for the national side since he took a break following the 2018 World Cup.

Argentina were knocked out of the tournament in the second round and Messi, who has still not scored a goal in the knockout stages of any of the four World Cups in which he has featured, was criticised by some fans.

The 31-year-old said going from Barcelona to Argentina was difficult and blamed their poor performances in Russia on a swift transition from promoting younger players to take up senior positions in the team.

""I think the generational change was very brusque,"" Messi said. ""It should have been done slower. You need to give the kids time and confidence. The change was a really big one.""

Messi said he was still tortured by the loss of the 2014 World Cup final to Germany in extra time and warned fans not to expect too much from Argentina at this year's Copa America in Brazil.

""Do you know the number of times I've replayed the final and the chances we had? It would have been so different if we'd scored one of them,"" he explained.

""Being realistic, a lot of work is needed to be a powerhouse. These kids have played very few matches for the national team. We need to be patient and I have no doubt that we are going to be strong.""

""I am going to stretch out my retirement as long as I can,"" Messi said, adding that if he did return to Argentina it would be to play for his hometown club Newell's Old Boys.

""I would love to end my career at Newell's but it's not easy. Sincerely, I don't know.""

Indian wrestler Kavita Devi to compete in Mae Young Classic tourney 

","
MUMBAI: Braun Strowman, a World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) superstar, has announced that Indian wrestler Kavita Devi will compete in the Mae Young Classic Tournament to be held next month in the US.

Roger Federer books Denis Shapovalov showdown in Miami 

","
MIAMI: Roger Federer will make Denis Shapovalov's dream come true on Friday after the Swiss booked a Miami Open semi-final against the Canadian starlet with a ruthless 6-0 6-4 destruction of Kevin Anderson.


Shapovalov, who beat fellow young gun Frances Tiafoe 6-7 (5/7), 6-4, 6-2 to reach his third ATP Masters semi-final, grew up idolising and studying the 20 time Slam-winning Swiss legend who once again rolled back the years with a sublime show at Hard Rock Stadium.

This will be their first meeting and one the Canadian, who will break into the top 20 when the rankings are released next week, cannot wait for.

""It's a match up I have been looking forward to my whole life, a high stakes match against your idol. It's just a dream come true,"" said Shapovalov.

""I will try and approach it like any other game, try and enjoy it, give it my all. It will be a difficult match but I am just happy to have a chance to play him.""

Federer may have been the 19-year-old's hero but he's attempted to learn from Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic too.

""With Roger, I was always looking at his backhand and tried to copy him and build my game like his - aggressive, always coming in,"" said the number 20 seed.

With Shapovalov taking on Federer and long time friend and compatriot Felix Auger-Aliassime, 18, facing defending champion John Isner in the semis, the tennis stars of tomorrow are beginning to prove their worth on the biggest of stages.

""It's crazy for me and Felix to both have reached the semi-finals,"" Shapovalov said, while Federer called the clash of generations ""exciting"".

""It's an exciting draw, for John and for myself here, playing these young guys,"" Federer said.

""They are not just young, but they are very good, as well.

""I practiced with Denis way back, he might have been 16, 17. He was just hitting big. I was, like, 'Wow, it's unbelievable. How old is he? How good is he going to get? It's going to be tough against him.""

The Swiss came into the match with Anderson knowing the world number seven's huge serve could be the difference, just as it was in a dramatic five set, last eight encounter at Wimbledon won by the South African last summer.

Yet after a whirlwind first set, Federer had broken the Anderson serve three times and ""bageled"" his opponent, much to the delight of a packed house on center court who came to show their appreciation for the evergreen 37 year-old as he chases a fourth Miami title which would take his career tally to 101.

It was the first time Anderson, 32, has ever lost a first set at ATP level to love and although the second was far tighter, Federer was always in control.

Shapovalov, meanwhile, crashed home 40 winners in an entertaining tussle with American Tiafoe on a rain interrupted day in South Florida.


Barty breaks through
The weather certainly could have badly affected Ashleigh Barty's attempt to reach her biggest WTA final with a four hour delay putting her charge on hold.

The Australian had played just four games with Estonia's Anett Kontaveit before the rains came although once play resumed, the 22-year-old, who will break into the top 10 off the back of this excellent run to Saturday's final, took advantage of her error prone opponent to win 6-3 6-3.

""It was a very long day. I know we had to wait around but it was an opportunity to drink some coffee and watch the golf so I was relaxed,"" said Barty who took time out of the game in 2015 to play cricket before returning in 2016.

""When I came out I was ready for business."" Simona Halep's last four encounter with Karolina Pliskova was also affected by the inclement weather. The players rushed from court with the score locked at 3-3 in the first set.

France wants Indian businessmen to invest in its football clubs 

","
PARIS: France has opened the doors for Indian corporates to invest in its football clubs and use the ""perfect time"" to explore the home of the reigning world champions.


The World Cup triumph had had a huge ripple effect and Didier Quillot, CEO of France's Ligue de Football Professional (LFP), firmly believes that the momentum is with the country that has Kylian Mbappe in its ranks, and in which Neymar plays club football.

Both Quillot and Jean-Martial Ribes, head of communications at France's top club, Paris Saint-Germain, were more than happy to term the fast-growing Indian market a ""top priority"".

""We have now international investors from America and China. The value of Ligue 1 is increasing, and I strongly believe that it is the right time to invest in France, because the momentum is here,"" said Quillot.

""I think there are clubs who are looking for new shareholders, with cash capacity and marketing experience.

""India is our top priority along with the US and China. There is so much to do in football in India, we want to help. We can bring to India expertise in terms of academies, players and coaching,"" he added.

Ribes' line of thought is similar and the PSG man, in fact, did not rule out a friendly in India if that helps in building an association.

""For us, the Indian market is very important, the potential is massive. The problem is the game is really not developed yet (in India). We are looking very closely to what the Indian clubs are doing and we will probably advance progressively,"" he said.

The club had a brush with India in the past but plans did not quite take off in the manner the management would have liked them to.

""We did not find it easy to develop the academies. It is one of the top markets but not an easy one to break into. We need the right partners,"" Ribes explained.

""Someday, it will be great to have a PSG shop in Bombay or Delhi. We have sponsors from China, Indonesia and the United States of America. It would be great for us to have access to sponsors in India or Indian people representing our brand.

""There are very big companies in India but we need to have the access and right now, what we are missing is the access,"" he added.

Compared to the English Premier League and Spain's La Liga, Quillot admitted the French league still has some catching up to do.

""The aspiration is to increase the value of Ligue 1. In terms of domestic TV rights we are at par with La Liga, Bundesliga and above Serie A. We need to improve our performance in Champions League.

""We need to improve our value outside France. In terms of economics, I think we are catching up. In terms of quality of infrastructure, we are up there, with brand new stadiums being built in places like Bordeaux and Marseille before Euro 2016,"" Quillot told a group of Indian journalists at the LFP headquarter.

Roger Federer ready for John Isner shoot-out for Miami crown 

","
MIAMI: Roger Federer is gearing up for a Miami Open final shootout with John Isner on Sunday after blowing away young-gun Denis Shapovalov in straight sets.


Federer produced a 6-2, 6-4 masterclass at Hard Rock Stadium to leave up-and-coming star Shapovalov, who grew up idolizing the Swiss, chasing shadows during a difficult first set.

The Swiss was superb in dismantling the 19 year-old's game, but knows with huge serving Isner lying in wait in what will be the former world number one's 50th ATP Masters final, the key will be to defuse the reigning Miami Open champion's monster service game.

Isner used it to great effect in his 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/4) win over Shapovalov's friend and compatriot Felix Auger-Aliassime earlier in the day, smashing down 21 aces. He'll be looking for more of the same against 20 time Grand Slam champion Federer.

""Playing a big server like John is like being in a penalty shootout in soccer, but I enjoy it,"" said number four seed Federer who coped brilliantly with Kevin Anderson's dangerous serve in the quarter-finals, winning the first set to love.

""Sometimes you go with momentum. Sometimes you go with feel. Sometimes you guess maybe a little bit and sometimes you see it. It's a combination of all sort of things.

""You just hope that the stars align, that you pick the right side, that he picks the wrong side, that maybe he misses a serve, that you can put him in uncomfortable situations time and time again, and at the end somehow you find a way.""

Federer had no such challenge from Shapovalov, playing his fifth ATP Tour semi-final. Even though the Swiss was standing in his way of a first final, the 19 year-old stressed beforehand that it was a ""dream"" to take on Federer.

It quickly, however, turned into a nightmare.

The Canadian displayed understandable nerves early on, a struggle with his first serve proving as much in a 10 minute opening game which he eventually won.

Yet it didn't settle him down and when another horribly loose backhand flew long, Federer pocketed a vital early break and stayed in the driver's seat.

Shapovalov, who will jump to a career best 20th in the world thanks to this impressive run, enjoyed some much better moments in the second set and looked more relaxed, although the match was never in his hands.

He hit just eight winners in response to Federer's 30 but will learn from this.

""It's kind of surreal, being on the court against Roger,""admitted the Canadian who joked the only enjoyable moment for him was the warm up.

""Obviously I wasn't trying to focus on the fact that it's him on the other side.

""I was just trying to play as good as I can, but he played an excellent match. I wasn't able stay at his level. I'm just going to try to learn from this and move forward.""

Federer, assessing his own performance, said he played ""very well"".

""I had to because when you let Denis play, he's got some serious power and he gets rhythm going. He can really put you in uncomfortable situations.""

This was the first time since 2007 that two teenagers have reached an ATP Masters semi-finals and although both suffered disappointing defeats, they leave South Florida with their heads held high.

Auger-Aliassime's dream run finished with the youngster from Montreal competing confidently in the biggest match of his career even if he will rue the chances that escaped him after being broken while serving for the first and second set.

""Unusual,"" Isner called it. ""It could have been a little bit of inexperience and maybe a little bit of fatigue, also.""

Despite the disappointment etched all over Auger-Aliassime's face at the end, his run here will give him great confidence moving forward as he, and Shapovalov, aim to prove their Grand Slam credentials.

The 18-year-old is the youngest-ever male semi-finalist in Miami and only the second qualifier to reach the last four after Guillermo Canas reached the same stage in 2007 before losing to Novak Djokovic in the final.

Auger-Aliassime will also see his ranking jump from 55 to 33 in the world.

""I think I did the best that I could,"" he said. ""It's a chance you can't miss, serving two times for the set, and just -- I don't know. It's just terrible. The biggest lesson I learned was to stay in the present and believe in yourself.""

There is very less margin of error for bowlers against in-form David Warner: Ajinkya Rahane 

","
HYDERABAD: Rajasthan Royals skipper Ajinkya Rahane Friday admitted that it is very difficult for bowlers to defend any total against an opposition which has an in-form batsman like David Warner up their ranks.


Sanju Samson's (102 not out) second IPL ton was overshadowed by Warner's blistering fifty as Sunrisers Hyderabad beat Rajasthan by five wickets to register their first win in the ongoing IPL here.


POINTS TABLE | 
SCHEDULE

Samson's first century of the ongoing IPL went in vain, as chasing a mammoth 199-run target, Warner set up the platform with a breezy 69 off 37 balls and together with Jonny Bairstow (45 off 28) added a century stand for the opening wicket as Sunrisers chase down the score in 19 overs.

""I think first of all, we thought 190 plus was very good score. The wicket was stopping a bit and we were aiming to get 150 plus. But credit to Sunrisers for the momentum they got in the powerplay. When someone like Warner bats like that, it's very less margins for the bowler,"" Rahane said at the post-match presentation ceremony.

""They didn't lose momentum throughout. When he (Warner) got out, Vijay Shankar batted well too. Sanju's been fantastic for us. We all know how talented he is. I'm sure he's also hurt but he'll go miles. Consistency is the key for him,"" he added.

Sunrisers captain Kane Williamson credited Warner and Bairstow for setting up the platform for the win.

""It was a tough game, but Rajasthan Royals played really well. The openers set it up for us. It was a good collective effort. It certainly wasn't easy. There are some areas we want to touch up on. We needed many parts to fire to chase near 200 and it was a good experience for us,"" Williamson said.

Man-of-the-match Rashid Khan, who bowled an economical 1/24 spell and struck a four and six off Jofra Archer to finish off the chase, said he was happy with his performance.

""I just try my best to be positive in every game, in every department,"" he said.

Talking about Jos Buttler's dismissal, Rashid said: ""I think that was the plan (to Buttler) as I've got him early previously. So I just bowled in good areas and saw how it goes. I just tried my best to mix up my five leg-spinners.

""I realised it wasn't a wicket where there will be too much turn. Yes, I have five different leg-spins, with different actions and grip,"" he said.

Asked about his batting skill, the star Afghan cricketer said: ""My coaches have given me a lot of confidence in the nets that I'm capable of hitting it anywhere.""

'Spirit' and IPL are a born mismatch: Bishan Singh Bedi 

","
MUMBAI: Two incidents in back-to-back matches of the IPL this season have brought all cricket administrations’ dust-gathering rule-books and rust-gathering moralities in focus once again – the first, a batsman overstepping crease and the second, a bowler overstepping crease.




POINTS TABLE I SCHEDULE

The good old argument of restoring balance between following the rules of cricket and respecting the spirit of cricket is back in vogue for the umpteenth time. Much as this debate remains healthy for time to come, the two episodes raise another pertinent question with regards to the changing formats of the game: Is the balance being restored between the bat and the ball anymore?

In the case of batsman overstepping the crease – which took place on Wednesday evening when R Ashwin ‘Mankaded’ Ben Stokes – the International Cricket Council (ICC) rule is clear. The altered law 42.16 puts the onus on the non-striker to remain in his/her ground till the ball is bowled or risk being run out.

The Marylebone Cricket Club first accepted that Ashwin running out Stokes was well within the rules.

In 24 hours, the game’s hoariest watchdogs came up with a U-turn saying “we don’t think it was within the spirit of the game. Ashwin’s pause (at the crease) was too long”.

In the case of the bowler overstepping the crease (no-ball) – which took place on Thursday evening when Lasith Malinga’s no-ball went unchecked and Mumbai Indians won the game – once again, the ICC rules are abundantly clear: If not for a dismissal, the TV umpire has no authority whatsoever to bring a ‘noball’ to light. It is entirely the field umpire’s responsibility, unless a review has been called to adjudicate a potential dismissal.

However, a pertinent question remains: “Why have a field umpire check for no-balls (adjudicating on no-balls can get extremely tricky) when there’s technology (read: TV umpire) in place? Why not refer all no-balls through the TV umpire?”

Both, ICC and the BCCI, will do well to consider that their own set of rules are designed for conflict, extremely unclear of how they need to be perceived.

“Spirit an individual thing,” says Bishan Singh Bedi. “How you want to be remembered and respected for the way you played the game – that’s spirit. Not some written rule”.

The former left-arm spin legend takes a long pause when posed with the question: “IPL and spirit? Sort of a born mismatch, no?”

“Hmmm… I’ll agree with that,” he says.

However, where BCCI is concerned, it’s altogether a different story. Given their present state of affairs, it’s a bit rich to expect them to understand the term ‘spirit’ in the first place.

“They don’t even have a rulebook in place for their domestic cricket. They don’t even have a technical committee in place. Imagine, how far removed they are from the word ‘spirit’,” say those tracking the game.

The IPL has a two-member technical committee in India’s junior national coach Rahul Dravid and Team India bowling coach Bharat Arun. However, BCCI, the gigantic cricket administration that it makes itself to appear, has no committee in place whatsoever to determine technicalities of the game.

Tiger Woods' big run sends him to weekend against Rory McIlroy 

","
AUSTIN: Tiger Woods sent fans into a frenzy Friday with a sublime stretch of golf that left them wanting more at the Dell Technologies Match Play. 


And that's what they'll get.

Woods won four straight holes with three birdies and an 83-yard lob wedge that spun back into the hole for an eagle, carrying him into the weekend with a 4-and-2 victory over Patrick Cantlay.

``Just got hot right when I needed it,'' Woods said.

It gets even better: Next up for Woods is Rory McIlroy, the hottest player in golf.

McIlroy won his group by beating Matt Fitzpatrick, 4 and 2. Not only was it McIlroy's third victory in as many matches this week at Austin Country Club, he has never trailed and has led in 37 of the 42 holes he has played.

Woods and McIlroy have never faced with other in match play. The last time they squared off was in the final round last year at the Tour Championship, where Woods capped off his comeback season with a victory.

``I just hope I put up a better fight than I did in Atlanta last year,'' McIlroy said. ``I didn't have much of a game that day. But yeah, look, it's exciting. It's exciting for the tournament. I'm sure it's going to be exciting for us. I feel good about my game. I played well all year. I've continued to do that this week. So it will be exciting.''

Henrik Stenson emerged from the group of major champions by beating Jim Furyk, while Matt Kuchar birdied the last hole to tie Jon Rahm and win his group.

The 16 group winners advance to single elimination Saturday morning.

One match dwarfed them all. Woods hasn't competed in Texas since 2005, and he hasn't been in the Match Play since 2013. He had to beat Cantlay and have Aaron Wise knock off Brandt Snedeker to have any chance of advancing.

Cheers of ``Go Tiger!'' often were followed with ``Go Aaron Wise.''

Woods gave away holes with a poor flop shot behind the sixth green and a mediocre chip on No. 8 to fall 2 down. Cantlay, whose tee shot on No. 9 took a hard hop and wound up in the ravine, still had a 1-up lead when it all turned on the par-3 11th.

Woods holed a 20-foot birdie putt to square the match. Then, he made a 7-foot birdie putt to take the lead.

And then it was time for a decision.

The 13th hole played only 276 yards, all over water, a stiff breeze into them. Woods could tell Cantlay was leaning toward driver, and he opted to hit iron off the tee. Cantlay's drive was settled in a knob above the green, 40 feet from the hole for a chance at eagle.

``I knew I needed to put it up there to at least have a chance at 3, to force him to have a good pitch,'' Woods said.

It worked out to perfection. The ball stopped about 5 feet behind the hole on its second bounce and gently spun back toward the hole as fans in the double-decker hospitality tent behind the green rose to their feet and let out the loudest cheer of the day when it dropped.

Woods wasn't through. He holed a 20-foot birdie putt on the 14th to go 3 up with four holes to play, and there were delayed cheers from every corporate chalet along the back nine from fans watching on television.

Woods still needed help and says he didn't bother looking at scoreboards to check on the Snedeker match. It was a mismatch. Wise never trailed, was 2 up at the turn and won four of the next five holes to close out Snedeker.

McIlroy, coming off a victory in The Players Championship in his last start, has played so well this year that he has a chance to return to No. 1 in the world if he were to win this World Golf Championship.

He still has to win four matches, starting with a big one Saturday morning.

``We've played tournaments together, battled each other down the stretch at event, but never in a match-play situation,'' Woods said. ``It'll be fun.''

Stenson prefers single elimination to group play, one reason he has skipped the Match Play the last three years. Now he's in the knockout stage, facing Lucas Bjerregaard, the Dane who won his group featuring Justin Thomas.

``Nothing I've done these first three days is going to matter when we tee it up tomorrow,'' Stenson said.


In other matches:

Marc Leishman easily disposed of Bryson DeChambeau to reach the Round of 16 for the third time in five years.

Sergio Garcia lost his match to Patrick Reed and still advanced.

Branden Grace advanced out of the No. 1 group with a 3-0 record, while top seed Dustin Johnson failed to reach the weekend for the second straight time.

SRH vs RR, IPL 2019: Samson's ton goes in vain as Warner, Bairstow hand Sunrisers Hyderabad first win of the season 

","
HYDERABAD: Rajasthan Royals, on Friday night, who had lost the first game, found themselves up against a team against whom they had lost four of their five games – Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH). In fact, SRH had won the last three encounters, including both games last season, and have an enviable record at the RGIC Stadium – having won 15 of their 21 games since 2016.
 


IPL Schedule | IPL Points Table | Scorecard
Royals needed to come up with something special to get their campaign on track. Sanju Samson produced a magical innings as he tore the Sunrisers bowling to shreds on way to a belligerent century (102, 55b, 10x4, 4x6). With skipper Ajinkya Rahane (70; 49b, 4x4, 3x6) playing a well-calculated innings, Royals ended up with 198 for two. The Royals went into the break believing that they had done enough to get their first points of the season.

However, the hosts had other ideas as they carved out a five–wicket win to keep their citadel intact. The man who looks ‘like David but hits like Goliath’ showed why he is the most dangerous batsman in the world. David Warner came out all guns blazing as he toyed with the Royals attack to make a mockery of the challenge.



The opener struck Dhawal Kulkarni for a boundary off the first ball to make his intentions clear. There was no stopping the pocket dynamite as Sunrisers raced to 69 at the end of the powerplay with Warner getting 52 of those off just 27 balls. Jonny Bairstow too joined the party and the Sunrisers cruised past the 100-run mark in the ninth over.



Royals hung in grimly for the break and it came when Stokes induced Warner (69; 37b, 9x4, 2x6) to pull a short ball down Kulkarni’s throat. Two balls later, Kulkarni muffed up a chance offered by Bairstow. Kulkarni, however, made amends in the next over by catching Bairstow (44; 28b, 6x4, 1x6) off Shreyas Gopal.



At the end of the 13th over, Sunrisers were 136 for two and needed 63 off 42 balls. The Royals fancied a comeback but Vijay Shankar took over as he smoked three sixes and a four in a 15-ball 35 before falling to Gopal. The leg spinner trapped Manish Pandey leg before off the next ball to peg the Sunrisers’ charge. Yusuf Pathan (16) and Rashid Khan (15) completed the formalities in the 19th over as the hosts replied with 201 for five.

Earlier, Rahane won the toss and had no hesitation in batting first but the start that they envisioned didn’t take place. Rahane struggled to get on top of the bowlers as the SRH kept a tight leash on the scoring.

Former Australia captain Tim Cahill ends playing career 

","
Former Australia captain Tim Cahill has announced his retirement from football at the age of 39 to focus on a career in media and coaching.


Cahill, who spent 15 seasons in England playing for Millwall and Everton, ended his international career after last year's World Cup in Russia as his country's top scorer with 50 goals.

He came out of international retirement in November for a farewell match against Lebanon, a month after signing for Indian Super League side Jamshedpur FC.

""No, I'm an old man now in football years,"" Cahill told Australia's Optus Sport when asked if he wanted to keep playing at club level.

""I'd love to keep playing... but I'm interested in TV. I'm going to start my (coaching) A license, spend quality time with my family and chill out for a bit.""

After playing for Everton in the Premier League, Cahill spent three seasons with Major League Soccer side New York Red Bulls before moving to the Chinese Super League, where he played for Shanghai Shenhua and Hangzhou Greentown.

He moved to Australian A-League side Melbourne City in 2016 before rejoining Millwall in January last year, but was released by the second-tier English side at the end of the season.

""It was amazing to play in four big continents,"" added Cahill, who made more than 500 club appearances during his 21-year career. ""I had a great career and I'm really thankful.

""I'm someone that massively respects the game and I'll take my time to learn more. Coaching is something that's definitely going to be on the horizon.""

Shikhar Dhawan should play attacking cricket: Sourav Ganguly 

","
NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals (DC) opener Shikhar Dhawan batted at the nets, took some throwdowns from head coach Ricky Ponting and finally had a long chat with advisor Sourav Ganguly before heading to the dressing room at the Feroz Shah Kotla on Friday.



IPL Schedule | 
IPL Points Table

Dhawan's role will be crucial in Saturday's Indian Premier League (IPL) match against Kolkata Knight Riders as DC look to get back to winning ways after losing their last game against Chennai Super Kings on Tuesday.

Ganguly said it was a simple chat and he just asked the India opener to stick to the basics and not over experiment.

""It wasn't a struggle in the last few games. He just played differently and will play differently against Kolkata. I had a chat with him after the nets and just asked him to take it like a normal T20 game and play attacking cricket,"" Ganguly said.

Interestingly, the emotions in Kolkata will be divided on Saturday as their favourite son is now a part of the Delhi outfit. Asked if such thoughts crossed his mind when he was playing for Pune Warriors India, Ganguly didn't wish to go back in time.

""That is way too far. My focus is on the job at hand and I am hoping that we go out tomorrow and play good cricket,"" the former India captain said.

An important factor in Saturday's game will be the way the DC boys take on KKR's in-form all-rounder Andre Russell. The West Indian has single-handedly won Kolkata both their games in the IPL so far.

While Russell hit a swashbuckling unbeaten 49 off 19 balls in the first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad, he cracked another match-winning 48 off 17 balls against Kings XI Punjab. But Ganguly has a small warning for the superstar.

""He is definitely in very good form. But cricket is a game of uncertainties and anyone of our bowlers can have a good game against him. So, let's wait and watch,"" Ganguly said.

Roger Federer cruises on while Simona Halep advances to semi-finals 

","
MIAMI: Roger Federer edged closer to his fourth ATP and WTA Miami Open title on Wednesday, swatting aside Russia's Daniil Medvedev 6-4 6-2 in only 61 minutes.


In a clash postponed from Tuesday due to heavy rain, the 20-time Grand Slam champion -- celebrating 20 years at the South Florida event -- sealed a last-eight meeting with South African Kevin Anderson in ruthless fashion.

Medvedev was in fine form, the 23-year-old having won his fourth ATP career title in Sofia last month and aiming for his first Masters 1000 quarter-final.

But in front of a packed center court, Swiss legend Federer rolled back the years with a dominant display to serve notice of his intent to land his 101st career title in Sunday's final.

""The key moment was when I held at the end of the first set but in the second I played well and really went for my shots,"" Federer said.

And he expects the best in the quarter-finals from Anderson despite the South African's recent right elbow injury.

""I am happy to see Kevin playing again after his injury problems,"" Federer said. ""He's one of the best servers in the world.""

On the women's side, Romania's Simona Halep moved closer to reclaiming the world number one ranking by reaching the semi-finals, defeating China's Wang Qiang 6-4, 7-5.

Halep needs only to reach Saturday's final at Hard Rock Stadium to knock Naomi Osaka from atop the women's rankings despite the Japanese star winning her second major title in this year's Australian Open.

Halep, who rallied from 5-1 down to take the second set, will try to reach her first South Florida final and reclaim the top spot by defeating the winner of a later all-Czech contest between world number five Karolina Pliskova and Marketa Vondrousova.

Evergreen Federer took control with an impressive opening set. The 37-year-old Swiss was working well behind a solid service game -- he won 81% of points on his first serve and finished the match on 85% -- and also saved all three break points the Russian mustered.

The key sequence came when Medvedev was broken for 5-4 before failing to take the chance to make amends in the very next game. Federer found himself 0-40 down but managed to hold before proceeding to seal the first set.

An instant break at the start of the second marked the beginning of the end for the world number 15.

Hopman Cup departs Perth after 31 years as new ATP Cup takes over 

","
SYDNEY: The unique mixed teams Hopman Cup in Perth has been axed after 31 years and replaced by the ATP World Team Cup, officials said Thursday in a revamp of the season-opening tennis calendar.


Two of the three cities to host the new men-only tournament -- Sydney and Brisbane -- had already been announced with Perth now confirmed as the third.

It means the popular Hopman Cup, won this year by Swiss pair Roger Federer and Belinda Bencic, has had to make way.

""While many may be looking at this change and saying we've lost something, we've actually gained something,"" said Tennis Australia chief Craig Tiley.

""This global event, which will be broadcast in every country around the world, will showcase this great city (Perth) to the world.

""The ATP Cup will launch the global tennis season for the men -- this is their event, it means a lot to them and they've thrown their support behind it 100 percent,"" he added.

Hopman Cup founder and former tennis great Paul McNamee told broadcaster ABC it was a sad day.

""Nothing could've been embraced by the people of the city more than the Hopman Cup in Perth, so my immediate feeling is sadness that it's not going to be there anymore, and concern about where the Hopman Cup may be in the future,"" he said.

The International Tennis Federation said it was keen to keep the mixed team format alive and had received interest from cities around the world keen to host the Hopman Cup.

""We are in discussions with potential partners to decide where and when this tournament will be next hosted,"" said ITF president David Haggerty.

""We will keep the Hopman Cup alive and look forward to successful future editions of this unique event.""

The Association of Tennis Professionals, which runs the men's game, voted in London earlier this year to award the new ATP Cup tournament, which carries 750 ranking points, to Australia.

It will be played annually over 10 days -- with the inaugural event beginning on January 3, 2020 -- in the lead-up to the Australian Open, the first Grand Slam of the year.

Sydney will host the final of the 24-team event with Brisbane and Perth holding round-robin games, with nations split into six groups. Eight teams will make it to the knockout phase.

There will be up to five players in each team, with ties comprising two singles matches and one doubles, and player eligibility determined by ATP rankings.

It is yet to be decided which countries will play in which city.

""We know the ATP Cup will provide a great way to open the season -- bringing together the world's best for a major team event that compliments existing scheduling, provides highly-coveted ATP ranking points and clearly links to the Australian Open,"" said ATP chief Chris Kermode.

Over the years the Hopman Cup, named after Australian tennis great Harry Hopman, proved an extremely popular format and attracted many of the game's biggest names.

Federer has won it a record three times and this year faced Serena Williams across the net in mixed doubles as Switzerland took on the United States.

At the time Williams said it would be ""heartbreaking"" if the tournament was axed while Federer called it ""an unbelievable event"".

Its demise means no more women's tennis in Perth, although Tiley said he was in ""deep discussions"" with the WTA Tour about remedying that, although not in time for 2020.

Sydney has also lost its January women's tournament, but a new combined men's and women's event in Adelaide has been announced while the WTA Brisbane International has been retained.

Chennaiyin beat Mumbai City to progress to the quarters of Super Cup 

","
BHUBANESWAR: Chennaiyin booked their place in the quarter-finals of the 2019 Hero Super Cup with a clinical 2-0 win over Mumbai City FC at the Kalinga Stadium here Friday.


CK Vineeth opened the scoring for Chennaiyin with a brilliant long-range curler in the 42nd minute.

Jeje Lalepkhlua almost instantly doubled the lead with a well-worked goal.

Mumbai City were toothless in attack as they failed to break down Chennaiyin's defence.

The match started on a cagey note with both sides battling it out in the midfield. Raynier Fernandes of Mumbai City and Isaac Vanmalsawma of Chennaiyin caused the most danger with their pace and trickery.

However, the first real opening of the game would fall to striker Jeje for Chennaiyin. The forward picked up the ball near the edge of the box. With Lucian Goian standing up to him, he created a yard of space for himself before firing a left-footed shot which went wide of the far post.

A few minutes later, Chennaiyin had another good opportunity to break the deadlock from a set-piece. Isaac's free-kick from just outside the box seemed to be heading for the back of the net, however Ravi Kumar was at hand to prevent it.

The Islanders failed to muster up any clear opportunities in the half, with Raynier Fernandes' long-range shot testing the palms of Karnajit Singh.

Just when it looked like the half would end goalless, Vineeth opened the scoring with a sumptuous finish. The 30-year-old found space outside the penalty box, turned and then fired a shot, which flew into the top corner.

Only a minute later, Jeje doubled Chennaiyin's lead with another neat finish. This time the Mizo sniper got on the end of a well-placed cross from Thoi Singh, before efficiently guiding the ball into the top corner, leaving the goalkeeper with no chance. With that, the Marina Machans entered the half with a healthy two goal lead.

John Gregory's unit were riding high on confidence with the lead and nearly scored a third within minutes of the second period.

Vineeth again threatened the Mumbai defenders with his clever movement. He managed to find a few yards of space from 25-yard-out before unleashing a fierce drive, which forced Ravi Kumar into a fine save.

Mumbai continued to struggle in the second half, failing to break down Chennaiyin's resolute defence. Goian came closest to pulling a goal back for Mumbai when his long-range attempt nearly creeped into the far post.

That proved to be the only notable attempt for Mumbai as the likes of Mailson Alves and Eli Sabia held their fort well to ensure that the South-Indian team finished with a clean sheet.

4th ODI: Australia claim narrow win despite Abid Ali's debut hundred 

","
DUBAI: Australia pulled off a sensational last-over, six-run win despite a debut hundred by Pakistan's Abid Ali and second career century by Mohammad Rizwan in the fourth one-day international in Dubai on Friday.


Needing 278 to win, Pakistan were brought close to their target by Ali's 112 and Rizwan's 104 but in the end the twin hundreds were in vain as they failed to score a required 17 off Marcus Stoinis's last over.


SCORECARD

The win gives Australia a 4-0 lead with the last match also in Dubai on Sunday.

Glenn Maxwell missed a second career hundred by just two runs, Usman Khawaja scored 62 and Alex Carey 55 as Australia posted 277-7 in their 50 overs.

Ali and Rizwan had put Pakistan on course for victory with a 144-run third-wicket stand but once Ali departed off leg-spinner Adam Zampa in the 42nd over, the innings wilted under the pressure of 60 runs in the last 8.5 overs.

Umar Akmal and debutant Saad Ali fell for seven each to paceman Nathan Coulter-Nile who finished with 3-53 while Stoinis had Rizwan and Usman Shinwari (six) in the final over to seal the win.

Ali, only drafted into the side two hours before the start after Imam-ul-Haq went down with fever, grabbed his opportunity, completing his hundred off 111 balls.

He was lucky to survive a leg-before appeal on 98 off Zampa as the review went on umpire's call. He took two singles to reach the three-figures mark.

Ali is the 15th batsman to score a hundred on one-day international debut. Salim Elahi (102 not out v Sri Lanka at Gujranwala in 1995) and Imam (100 v Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi 2017) were the other two Pakistani batsmen to score debut ODI tons.

Ali hit nine boundaries in his 111-ball knock while Rizwan had a six and nine boundaries off 102 balls.

Earlier, it was Maxwell who lifted Australia -- sent into bat -- from 140-5 to an imposing total. Maxwell hit three sixes and nine boundaries in his 98 off 82 balls.

A new look Pakistan team, with Imad Wasim as skipper after Shoaib Malik was ruled out with a rib injury, caught Australia napping at 101-4 when Maxwell walked in.

Dropped on 10 by keeper Rizwan off Yasir Shah, Maxwell repaired the innings with a 134-run partnership for the sixth wicket with Carey who finished with 67-ball 55 for his maiden fifty with three boundaries.

Maxwell, bowled by fast bowler Usman Shinwari off a no-ball when on 76, was within a sight of his second ODI hundred when he was run out while attempting a double run.

Carey supported Maxwell as the pair beat the previous sixth wicket stand in Australia-Pakistan ODIs of 90 between Dirk Wellham and Rod Marsh at Sydney in 1981.

Australia lost in-form opener Aaron Finch for 39, one short of completing 4,000 one-day runs while Usman Khawaja made a solid 78-ball 62 with six boundaries before he was trapped leg-before by Yasir who finished with 2-57.

Wasim, who had figures of 2-56, dismissed Shaun Marsh (five) and Peter Handscomb (seven) while Mohammad Hasnain got the prized wicket of Finch before dismissing Carey off the last ball, grabbing 2-52.

MI vs KXIP, Today IPL match: Mumbai Indians look to revel in Kings XI Punjab's court 

","
MOHALI: After a mixed start to their IPL season, Kings XI Punjab will aim to get their act together when they kick off their home campaign against slow starters Mumbai Indians at the Punjab Cricket Association Stadium here on Saturday.



POINTS TABLE I SCHEDULE

Kings XI started off their IPL campaign with a close 14-run win over Rajasthan Royals in Jaipur before going down to Kolkata Knight Riders by 28 runs in a run-fest at the Eden Gardens on Wednesday. Back in their den, Punjab will be eager to shrug off the rusty start and the controversies associated with the opening two games, with captain R Ashwin being embroiled in both. Ashwin, who drew a lot of flak after his ‘Mankading’ adventure in Jaipur, once again found himself in the middle of the storm when his field-placement error against KKR dangerman Andre Russell cost them dear.



Going in to the first match of this weekend’s double header, the Kings will look to get their bowling conundrum sorted after the likes of Mohammed Shami, Sam Curran, Ankit Rajpoot and Andrew Tye were taken to the cleaners in the first couple of games. The bowling department will have their task cut out against a formidable Mumbai batting lineup, led by Rohit Sharma and also comprising power-hitters Yuvraj Singh, Keiron Pollard and Quinton de Kock.

 Coming to the home team’s batting, the onus will be on veteran West Indies opener Chris Gayle to give the side a rollicking start and set the stage for the in-form middle order. Gayle began the season with a match-winning 79 against the Royals.




Concern over KL’s form
With a World Cup berth hanging over his head, opener Lokesh Rahul will be eager to get over his patchy form, that has yielded him scores of 4 and 1 in the opening two matches. Rahul , who returned to the national side after a ban, managed scores of 50 and 47 in the two T20I games against Australia but has not bee able replicate that effort in the IPL.


Mumbai’s four-pronged pace battery
Rohit Sharma’s brigade made up for their shaky 37-run losing start to Delhi Capitals at home with a sloppy six-run win over the Royal Challengers in Bengaluru on Thursday, and will be hoping to build on that effort here. Mumbai struggled to defend a healthy score of 187/8 in a last-ball thriller against Bangalore, who could only blame their fortunes for the massive umpiring error on the final delivery from veteran Lasith Malinga.

The Mumbai side boasts of a pace-heavy attack, led by Malinga and Jasprit Bumrah, currently the best fast bowler in the world, along with Mitchell McClenaghan and Hardik Pandya.

India maul Poland 10-0 in Sultan Azlan Shah Cup 

","
IPOH (Malaysia): Striker Mandeep Singh continued his rich form and scored a brace to help India thrash minnows Poland 10-0 in their last league match of the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament on Friday.


Already assured of a place in Saturday's summit clash against Korea, the Indians scored goals almost at will, leaving the Polish players in daze.

Besides Mandeep (50th, 51st minutes), dragflicker Varun Kumar (18th, 25th) also struck twice while Vivek Sagar Prasad (1st), Sumit Kumar (7th), Surender Kumar (19th), Simranjeet Singh (29th), Nilankanta Sharma (36th) and Amit Rohitdas (55th) were the other goal-scorers for India.

Five-time champions India, thus, maintained their unbeaten streak in the tournament, collecting 13 points from five league matches with the help of four wins and a draw.

With two strikes on Friday, Mandeep became the highest goal-scorer in the tournament with a total of seven goals while Varun took his personal tally to five goals so far.

It was expected to be a one-sided contest and it turned out to be so as India raced to a 2-0 lead by the seventh minute through Vivek and Sumit's goals.

The second quarter saw India strengthen their attack as they made space inside the striking circle. In good form, Sumit earned a penalty corner for India which was perfectly converted by Varun.

A minute later, Surender registered his name in the score sheet by scoring from a penalty corner created by Rohidas.

Though India lost forward Shilanand Lakra to a green card in the 24th minute, they secured another penalty corner and Varun was bang on target with a powerful flick to hand his side a commanding 5-0 lead.

Simranjeet then added to the team's tally when he worked with Mandeep after receiving a beautiful assist from Nilakanta Sharma to put the ball past Polish goalkeeper Mateusz Popiolkowski.

With a formidable 6-0 lead at half-time, India continued to dominate after the change of ends.

In the 36th minute, it was Nilakanta's turn to score after receiving a good pass from Sumit.

Though India managed only one goal in the third quarter, the team made a strong finish in the fourth quarter and scored three more goals.

The Polish goalkeeper, meanwhile, was impressive as he made some brilliant saves to keep Gursahibjit Singh and Simranjeet Singh at bay early in the fourth quarter. A powerfully struck penalty corner by Rohidas too was well-saved by Popiolkowski.

India's eighth and ninth goal came off skilful displays by Mandeep. His first goal was scored after he intercepted Michal Raciniewski to take a direct shot on goal, while his second was well-assisted by Gurinder Singh.

India's 10th goal was scored after Surender earned a penalty corner with Amit making a good conversion.

IPL 2019, DC vs KKR: More responsible and mature now, Andre Russell hogs spotlight at Kotla 

","
NEW DELHI: Andre Russell walked out to the Ferozeshah Kotla turf for practice with the entire Kolkata Knight Riders squad. Soon, he moved away from the bunch and went through his own drills. For the marauding form that he has shown in the first two games, one was expecting him to get into range-hitting immediately, as his Delhi Capitals counterparts were in the adjacent practice area.



POINTS TABLE I SCHEDULE

Russell instead got down to knocking back low, full balls to the throwdown specialist with an unusual narrow stance before heading to the nets to perfect his yorkers. He meant business. There were no chuckles or banters like his team-mates. The Capitals’ formidable pace attack of Kagiso Rabada, Trent Boult and Chris Morris would have been watching from the adjacent nets, trying to get a sense of what’s in store for them when they take the field here on Saturday evening.



The hosts may boast of exciting power-hitters like Rishabh Pant and Chris Morris but the crowd will be on the edge of their seats when the big Jamaican occupies the crease. “The fact that Russ led Jamaica Tallawahs in the Caribbean Premier League has given him the sense of responsibility towards the team. He looks at himself as a senior statesman in the group and wants to make every outing of his count,” Russell’s KKR teammate Robin Uthappa reckoned on the eve of the match.

Russell’s two match-defining knocks so far must have sent the rival thinktank into overdrive even as Capitals advisor Sourav Ganguly chose to dismiss the ‘Russell factor’ by saying: “Anybody could have one good day.”



“Russ is an absolute genius at hitting the cricket ball, it’s pretty simple as that. At the end of the day, I think it’s going to be a case of he misses and I hit. I don’t want to give away too many tactics or anything,” was Morris’ retort. Then the confession followed: “I’ve always said to people I look like a duck while swimming in water that is nice and calm, but underneath (the water) their feet are kicking like this. I might look calm and collected, but inside my brain’s working overtime.”

That’s what he has managed to do — getting into head to inject a sense of fear. At the same, his team needs to ensure that it doesn’t get into a comfort zone. “It’s sometimes a double-edged sword,” Uthappa said. “The strike rate of 130-135 is the average you want to maintain. Russ is going to have a few bad days. It’s bound to happen the way he plays. Hopefully there are not as many bad days as good days.”

Barring Kuldeep Yadav, KKR don’t have the big stars of Indian cricket in their ranks. But it’s their own Russ who is currently making things easier for skipper Dinesh Karthik. He’s become more game aware. “He understands the impact he can have in the last four overs. It’s important for him to have the freedom. It would be great for him to have batsman batting with him,” Uthappa summed up the scenario.

If anything, inconsistency has been Russell’s problem over the years. But going by Uthappa’s claims, Russell is out to change that notion. Kotla could be in for some serious fireworks!

Mohamed Moustahsane elected interim boxing chief 

","
PARIS: The troubled International Boxing Federation (AIBA) on Friday selected Mohamed Moustahsane to serve as interim president.


He replaces Gafur Rahimov, a controversial Uzbek businessman who stood down last week under pressure from the International Olympic Committee.

On Friday, the AIBA executive committee voted 23-0, with two abstentions, to appoint Moustahsane, a 40-year-old Moroccan physician who has served as ringside doctor.

He becomes the fourth head of AIBA in 18 months.

The IOC has frozen boxing's preparations for the 2020 Tokyo Games as it seeks proof that the AIBA has cleaned up its act sufficiently after allegations of bout-fixing at the Rio Olympics in 2016.

The inquiry also covers AIBA governance and its anti-doping programme.

This week, AIBA admitted it had debts of $16 million.

Russian boxing chief Umar Kremlev, who had put himself forward as a presidential candidate, offered to settle that debt from his own pocket, if AIBA was allowed to remain in charge at the Tokyo Olympics.

The IOC announced Thursday it will deliver its verdict on boxing's Tokyo fate on May 22.

If the AIBA's Olympic suspension is maintained the IOC has said it will step in to ensure the sport appears in Tokyo.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer appointed full-time Manchester United manager 

","
LONDON: Manchester United have appointed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as their full-time manager on a three-year contract, the Premier League club said on Thursday.


The 46-year-old Norwegian has guided United to 14 wins in 19 matches in all competitions as caretaker boss since replacing the sacked Jose Mourinho in December.


Ole’s at the wheel! We can confirm that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been appointed as #MUFC manager.— Manchester United (@ManUtd) 1553763651000
""From the first day I arrived, I felt at home at this special club,"" Solskjaer said in a statement. 

""It was an honour to be a Manchester United player, and then to start my coaching career here.

""This is the job that I always dreamed of doing and I'm beyond excited to have the chance to lead the club long-term and hopefully deliver the continued success that our amazing fans deserve.""

United have won 10 of their 13 Premier League games under Solskjaer and reached the Champions League quarter-finals with a dramatic victory at French champions Paris St Germain.

Several members of the first-team squad, including record signing Paul Pogba, have praised Solskjaer for restoring the confidence and freedom the team lacked towards the end of Mourinho's tenure.

""More than just performances and results, Ole brings a wealth of experience, both as a player and as a coach, coupled with a desire to give young players their chance and a deep understanding of the culture of the club,"" said Ed Woodward, United's executive vice chairman.

""This all means that he is the right person to take Manchester United forward. I want to thank Ole and the coaching team for everything they have done so far and congratulate him on this richly deserved appointment.""

Fifth-placed United, who are locked in a battle for Champions League qualification spots with Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur, host Watford in the league on Saturday.

'Spirit' and IPL are a born mismatch: Bishan Singh Bedi 

","
MUMBAI: Two incidents in back-to-back matches of the IPL this season have brought all cricket administrations’ dust-gathering rule-books and rust-gathering moralities in focus once again – the first, a batsman overstepping crease and the second, a bowler overstepping crease.




POINTS TABLE I SCHEDULE

The good old argument of restoring balance between following the rules of cricket and respecting the spirit of cricket is back in vogue for the umpteenth time. Much as this debate remains healthy for time to come, the two episodes raise another pertinent question with regards to the changing formats of the game: Is the balance being restored between the bat and the ball anymore?

In the case of batsman overstepping the crease – which took place on Wednesday evening when R Ashwin ‘Mankaded’ Ben Stokes – the International Cricket Council (ICC) rule is clear. The altered law 42.16 puts the onus on the non-striker to remain in his/her ground till the ball is bowled or risk being run out.

The Marylebone Cricket Club first accepted that Ashwin running out Stokes was well within the rules.

In 24 hours, the game’s hoariest watchdogs came up with a U-turn saying “we don’t think it was within the spirit of the game. Ashwin’s pause (at the crease) was too long”.

In the case of the bowler overstepping the crease (no-ball) – which took place on Thursday evening when Lasith Malinga’s no-ball went unchecked and Mumbai Indians won the game – once again, the ICC rules are abundantly clear: If not for a dismissal, the TV umpire has no authority whatsoever to bring a ‘noball’ to light. It is entirely the field umpire’s responsibility, unless a review has been called to adjudicate a potential dismissal.

However, a pertinent question remains: “Why have a field umpire check for no-balls (adjudicating on no-balls can get extremely tricky) when there’s technology (read: TV umpire) in place? Why not refer all no-balls through the TV umpire?”

Both, ICC and the BCCI, will do well to consider that their own set of rules are designed for conflict, extremely unclear of how they need to be perceived.

“Spirit an individual thing,” says Bishan Singh Bedi. “How you want to be remembered and respected for the way you played the game – that’s spirit. Not some written rule”.

The former left-arm spin legend takes a long pause when posed with the question: “IPL and spirit? Sort of a born mismatch, no?”

“Hmmm… I’ll agree with that,” he says.

However, where BCCI is concerned, it’s altogether a different story. Given their present state of affairs, it’s a bit rich to expect them to understand the term ‘spirit’ in the first place.

“They don’t even have a rulebook in place for their domestic cricket. They don’t even have a technical committee in place. Imagine, how far removed they are from the word ‘spirit’,” say those tracking the game.

The IPL has a two-member technical committee in India’s junior national coach Rahul Dravid and Team India bowling coach Bharat Arun. However, BCCI, the gigantic cricket administration that it makes itself to appear, has no committee in place whatsoever to determine technicalities of the game.

Lionel Messi upset with criticism from Argentina fans 

","
BUENOS AIRES: Argentina star Lionel Messi admitted Friday to being upset with constant criticism in his homeland, saying in an interview that even his 6-year-old son asks why his countrymen attack his performances for the national team.


Many Argentinans feel Messi doesn't have the same enthusiasm for international soccer that he does for his club Barcelona.

They also questioned his silence after being eliminated from last year's World Cup by France, something Messi said he wanted to forget.

``I wanted to distance myself from the team, let time go by and cool myself. It was painful to end the cycle this way,'' Messi said.

``Many people said I should not return (to the national team). Family, friends. My 6-year-old (asked me) `Why do they kill you in Argentina, daddy?'''

The 31-year-old Argentina captain said he still wants to win a tournament and will keep trying with the team under coach Lionel Scaloni.

``Those that don't like me will have to stand me a little longer,'' Messi said, adding he had already achieved ``extraordinary things'' with Argentina, including ``a World Cup final, two Copa America finals, and that is not easy.''

The five-time Ballon D'Or winner said he doesn't need to say he loves Argentina ``in every instant'' because he expresses his passion for his home nation ``in another way.''

Messi also denied he decides who plays for the national team.

``We have heard about this `club of friends' thing for years. They say I pick the players, the coaches. I basically manage the whole AFA (Argentina's soccer association),'' he ironically said.

Messi pointed out that average Argentinians are kind with him whenever he visits the South American country.

``I get upset that people are lied to,'' Messi said.

The striker insisted his absence in Argentina's 1-0 victory in a friendly against Morocco in Tangier on Tuesday was due to injury.

``I have a groin injury since the break in December and I have trained less, I haven't played all the matches,'' he said.

Before the win, Argentina lost to Venezuela 3-1 in Madrid in a friendly that marked Messi's return.

Scaloni said after that match that Messi will surely play in this year's Copa America, June 14 to July 7 in Brazil.

India Open: Viktor Axelsen lines up Parupalli Kashyap 

","
NEW DELHI: Viktor Axelsen doesn’t move around the court. He prowls and then pounces. The world No. 6 from Denmark, their best bet for the 2020 Olympics, pushed the degree of intensity a few notches higher leaving his opponent HS Prannoy gasping at the IG Stadium on Friday.


Literally running away with the first game in the quarterfinals by a margin of 11 points, Axelsen played to his strength. Lifting Prannoy’s drops, picking up the return and then killing the point with a jump smash. Like a champion pugilist, Axelsen employed his one-twothree to knock out Prannoy 21-10, 21-16. The unseeded Indian looked overwhelmed by Axelsen’s speed and power, attributes that took him to the All England final earlier this month.

The ride has been enviably smooth for PV Sindhu, the highest ranked women’s player in the India Open. Exuding a lot of energy, Mia Blitchfeldt tried her best to stop Sindhu’s march into the semifinals but for the Hyderabad girl, it was a just another ‘warm-up’ encounter. Sindhu won 21-19, 22-20. Stiffer test awaits Sindhu now in the form of world No. 7 He Bingjiao on her road to final.

Surprisingly, the world No. 6 Axelsen does not enjoy a proud record against Parupalli Kashyap, his semifinal opponent. The unseeded Indian enjoys a 2-0 head-to-head record against the Dane, though they have not met in recent times. Even Axelsen was surprised when he was reminded of it. “Is it? Then let’s see if I can settle some old scores tomorrow,” said Axelsen, who is enjoying a happy run at the Yonex-Sunrise India Open.

Against Wang Tzu Wei of Chinese Taipei, Kashyap lost five points on the bounce before stemming the slide in the second game after winning the first. A much-improved show saw him wrap up the match 21-11, 21-16, thus setting up a tough semifinal clash with the Dane.

Reaching the semifinals after almost four years, Kashyap said, “I am getting better physically. Both the days, I had quick games fortunately.” Kashyap’s target in the Olympic qualification year is to raise his rankings as much as possible. “Whoever makes it to Tokyo must win a medal,” he said.

In the all-India quarterfinal challenge, Kidambi Srikanth rallied from a game down to deny sparring partner Sai Praneeth. The highest seeded Indian pushed dangerously close to winning the first game but dig the shuttle into the net. Initiative swayed towards Praneeth who closed the first game 23-21.

Bruised but not battered, Srikanth forced a comeback in the second, winning by a 10-point margin. Neither ready to budge, the decider witnessed some close skirmishes as Praneeth went into the break leading 11-8.

At 16-16, Srikanth enjoyed a stroke of luck as the net chord came to his rescue. It stayed with him as Praneeth failed to break his rhythm in the crucial phase of the match and finally threw in the towel. Surviving a scare, Srikanth won the day 21-23, 21-11, 21-19.

Having a relatively easy semifinal opponent in Huang Yuxiang, the 26-year old Chinese whose highest ranking is 25, Srikanth is most likely to be seen in action on Sunday as well. “I am reiterating that familiarity makes everything difficult. We know each other so well, that the surprise factor is completely out of the book. I played the crucial points better than Sai. Pulling back the second game was the turning point of the match for me,” said Srikanth. “I am happy to have survived the three-setter.”

Fourth seed Ratchanok Intanon got the better of her younger compatriot Busanan Ongbamrungphan 21-18, 21-19 to keep her final hopes alight.

Last edition’s surprise winner, Beiwen Zhang, found the passage harder this time with China’s He Bingjiao, seeded third, put in a determined effort. Ranked seventh in the world, Bingjiao and Chen Yufei (No. 2) are the medals hopes from China in the Tokyo Olympics. Finding herself under pressure, the lefthanded Chinese shuttler had a premature celebration but the referral awarded her US opponent the point. She was subjected to another referral that she won to complete her semifinal journey 21-18, 26-24.

SEMIFINAL LINE UP: Men: Viktor Axelsen vs Parupalli Kashyap; Kidambi Srikanth vs Huang Yuxiang. Women: He Binjiao vs PV Sindhu; Ratchanok Intanon vs Han Yue.

PSG fans give Chelsea women a tough time 

","
PARIS: There were around 600 of them. But the noise made you believe there were 20,000. The PSG Ultras, the renowned fan group, were out in full force in the Women's Champions League quarterfinal second-leg between PSG and Chelsea in Paris on Wednesday.


Not often you get to see such passionate support for the women's game even for some of the biggest clubs in the world. It was not just the ultras who were egging on the PSG women. Approximately, 10,000 turned up for game at the Stade Jean-Bouin, a stone's throw away from the Parc des Princes, the home ground of the PSG men.

There was an extra edge to the match against Chelsea. In the first-leg of the quarterfinals, the PSG supporters were denied entry by the police in London. Allegedly, some of the Ultras were found to be in possession of weapons and drugs.

The PSG management, though, came out in support of their fans and criticized the British Police of unfairly targetting their supporters. Chelsea won the first leg 2-0 thanks to goals from Hannah Blundell and Erin Cuthbert and now had to deal with the vociferous PSG ultras.

It was clear from the beginning that the Chelsea women had to deal with the hostile atmosphere and hold their nerves in order to preserve their lead and advance. The Ultras got into the business straightaway. with their chants, banners and firecrackers. 'Treated as criminals', 'Deprived from our freedom', read some of the banners in English.

The intimidating atmosphere got to the Chelsea players. The PSG women were in control of the game from the beginning. Had they been a bit more clinical, they could have gone ahead in the first half itself.

But the goals duly came after the break. Kadidiatou Diani scored two minutes into the second half. An own goal by Chelsea's Ann-Katrin Berger made it 2-0 to PSG and 2-2 on aggregate. The Ultras, in the stand opposite to the dugout, started to light flares and sing 'Alles Paris Saint-Germain', the club anthem, in perfect harmony. The temperature hovered around five degree Celsius on a cold Wednesday evening but you could see plenty of men with no shirts, oblivious to the clime.

Sanju Samson scores first century of IPL 2019 

","
NEW DELHI: Sanju Samson turned the heat on Sunrises Hyderabad with the first century of the 2019 Indian Premier League (IPL) season, which powered Rajasthan Royals to 198/2 after they elected to bat first in the eighth match of IPL-12 at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal, Hyderabad, on Friday. However, Samson's effort remained futile as the hosts went on to win the match by five wickets. 



IPL Schedule | 
IPL Points Table

Samson's second century of IPL came off just 54 balls as the 24-year-old batsman, who hails from Kerala, finished with unbeaten 102 off 55 balls -- studded with 10 fours and four sixes. 

His first century of IPL came in 2017 for his former team Delhi Daredevils in the match against Rising Pune Supergiants. Incidentally, he scored 102 in that innings as well.

""It feels good to score an IPL hundred, but this is just the start of the tournament and I got to stay grounded and do what the team wants,"" Samson said during the innings break while speaking to the broadcasters. 

""The pitch was a bit slow to start with, but with time it got easy. I think we have set a good target with our bowling line-up. But cricket is a funny game, anything can happen,"" he added.

Opening the batting, RR skipper Ajinkya Rahane led from the front with 49-ball 70 and together with Samson shared 119 runs for the second wicket to set the base for the total after the early dismissal of Jos Buttler.

Rajasthan's decision to bat first didn't go according to plan, at least in the powerplay, as the visitors struggled against Sunrisers' disciplined bowling to garner just 35 runs in the first six overs.

After Buttler's dismissal, skipper Rahane was joined at the crease by Samson and the duo played cautiously without taking any undue risk to take Rajasthan forward.

Rahane registered his first fifty of this season in 38 balls while Samson brought up his half-century in 34 deliveries as the duo raised 100-run stand for the second wicket in 65 balls.

Sunrisers' successful run-chase was led by openers David Warner (69 off 37) and Jonny Bairstow (45 off 28), who stitched an opening partnership of 110 runs to lay a solid platform.

The home team went on to achieve the target with an over to spare. They finished with 201/5 for their first win of the season, after losing the opening match to Kolkata Knight Riders.

Ex-striker Shivendra Singh set to be appointed as assistant coach of Indian men's hockey team 

","
NEW DELHI: Former India centre forward Shivendra Singh is set to be appointed assistant coach of the national men's hockey team and will start working with the side next month.


A livewire during his playing days, Shivendra will exclusively work with the strikers and form an integral part of the Indian coaching staff set to be headed by Australian Graham Reid.

Reid's appointment is just a formality now after Hockey India and Sports Authority of India recommended his name to the Sports Ministry earlier this week.

Besides Shivendra, former Australian drag-flicker Chris Ciriello, who is the current analytical coach, will be the other assistant coach in the new set-up.

""Shivendra Singh will join the Indian team soon as an assistant coach soon. He will work with the forwards under the new chief coach,"" a source close to the development said.

Shivendra was part of the Indian team that won a silver medal in the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games, besides being a member of the bronze medal-winning side of 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games.

He also won a gold with the Indian team in 2007 Asia Cup and 2010 Sultan Azlan Shah Cup.

The coaching set-up will also have SAI coach Piyush Kumar Dubey, who is already with the team at the ongoing Azlan Shah Cup in Ipoh, Malaysia. He will exclusively work with the goalkeepers.

Meanwhile, the source also said that Reid was selected after he committed himself to Indian hockey and agreed to relocate to India with his family.

""The new coach has committed to India. He will be shifting his base to India with his family and will be based in Bengaluru,"" the source said.

He also said the new chief coach's tenure will be till 2020, extendable till 2022 World Cup depending upon his performance.

""The chief coach's tenure will be till the end of next year. As per world hockey standards every international coach's contract is supposed to be for an Olympic cycle.

""But his contract will have a provision os extension till 2022. Everything will depend on India's performances leading upto the Tokyo Olympics,"" the official said.

The Indian chief coach's position has been lying vacant after the unceremonious sacking of Harendra Singh in January following a less-than-impressive quarterfinal exit at the World Cup in Bhubaneswar last year.

The source also informed that once the Sports Ministry gives its final approval, the chief coach will need at least a month to join his new assignment.

""He (new chief coach) is still associated with a top national team and he will have to give four weeks notice period to be relieved from his current job.""

Incidentally, Reid, a former Australia coach, is currently the assistant coach of the Netherlands hockey team.

Besides the Netherlands job, Reid was also the coach of his former club Amsterdam since 2017, a position from which he was dismissed earlier this month.

As soon as that development took place, speculation started that he is interested in taking up the India job, a claim which he neither rejected nor accepted.

Looking to make Mohali our fortress: Craig McMillan 

","
MOHALI: The IS Bindra stadium was a happy hunting ground for hosts Kings XI Punjab, when they played here last year. They played four matches last year in Mohali and won all of them. Punjab’s fielding coach Craig McMillan believes they will make Mohali a happy hunting ground again.


“We are really looking forward to Saturday’s game because it is our first home match. Mohali was our fortress last year, we played some really good cricket here. Players are also excited to play here. We have been on the road the first two games,” said McMillan.

“I think home form is going to be very crucial for us to go all the way in the tournament. We are definitely looking to consolidate our home advantage,” he added. It has been a controversy-laden start for the Kings, having to endure a controversy involving their captain Ravichandran Ashwin who ‘Mankaded’ Rajasthan Royals batsman Jos Buttler in their tournament opener. When quizzed if that controversy has affected the team’s morale, McMillan said: “I don’t think it has any impact. It is a long tournament. We have moved on from the first game very quickly. Yes, we didn’t get the ideal result in Kolkata because they played better than us.”

Umpire Ravi's no-ball blunder puts focus on poor standard of umpiring in India, IPL 

","
BENGALURU: The cricket on display at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Thursday evening was completely overshadowed by the latest controversy to hit the IPL — umpire Sundaram Ravi's inability to spot Mumbai Indians bowler Lasith Malinga's last-ball no-ball to RCB batsman Shivam Dube, with Kohli's team needing seven runs for a win. 



POINTS TABLE I SCHEDULE

Eventually, Bangalore fell short by six runs. Ravi's oversight has generated keen debate over whether cricket needs an independent no-ball watchdog to relieve the already overburdened umpires. The ifs and buts of the free hit which would have followed a proper call, and whether it could have changed the course of the match, has put the focus squarely back on the standard of Indian umpires in general, and the standard of umpiring in the IPL in particular.

A host of former international cricketers have called for greater use of technology and a change of rules, especially since the current rules allow the on-field umpires to check for a no-ball only in case of a dismissal.

Four Indian umpires belong to the International panel of ICC Umpires and one —Ravi himself— is part of the 12-member Elite panel. None of that has spared the umpires from criticism, especially with umpiring standards on the domestic scene also presenting a dismal picture: all the three premier domestic tournaments this season -- the Vijay Hazare Trophy, the Ranji Trophy and the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy -- have been marred by howlers.



The plot thickens with the fact that the BCCI's umpiring sub-committee is now defunct, and the standards haven't come up for scrutiny in a while.

Understandably, RCB skipper Virat Kohli was left fuming in the aftermath, terming it a “ridiculous call”, but winning captain Rohit Sharma too was critical of the oversight, pointed out that more than the teams, it was the game which had suffered.

“Winning or losing doesn't matter. It is not good for the game of cricket. Those sorts of mistakes have to be avoided,” Rohit insisted. “For players, if you make a mistake, we pay for it. Eventually, the game will start moving in different direction if these things keep happening. It is not about who won the game, decisions are important and those crucial decisions can change the game. Whether it is a wide or a noball, we just have to be more aware,” added Rohit, whose team too was at the receiving end when a Jasprit Bumrah delivery in the 19th over was called wide when it was well within the lines that act as a guide to the umpire.



Asked if intervention of the third umpire was a possible solution or if the rules needed to be tweaked, Rohit explained, “I seriously don't know what the solution is. ICC/BCCI, whoever makes the decision, they need to come up with those ideas. I am not authorized to make a call on that. It is not good for the game; whatever is not good for the game, I am not going to stand for it. Those decisions can cost you the game and those games which cost you can hurt you towards the end of the tournament. We prepare so much to win this tournament, to win games, and those kinds of mistakes are not acceptable.”

With this the beginning of the tournament and the Mankad storm passing through slowly, the umpires— given the scrutiny they will be under— will have to deal with the additional pressure of being watched closely.

Romania's Halep would have reclaimed the top spot in women's tennis if she had reached Saturday's showpiece following current number one Naomi Osaka's early exit and Petra Kvitova falling to Ashleigh Barty in the last eight.

But Pliskova, the world number seven, had other ideas, rattling off an incredible nine games in a row to blitz Halep and set up an intriguing battle with Australian Barty -- a 6-3, 6-3 winner over Estonian Anett Kontaveit.

""It wasn't easy waiting for so long but I managed to stay aggressive,"" said Pliskova, who hit 29 winners to Halep's 18 in the match that finished after 1 am thanks to a series of rain delays. ""Ashleigh is a good player, but I am excited for the final.

The South Florida weather played havoc with Thursday's schedule at Hard Rock Stadium, no more so than when the rains returned with Pliskova on the brink of a brilliant win.

Play was initially halted at 3-3 in the in the first.

When they resumed, Halep edged ahead 5-3 before Pliskova roared back, taking the first set and a 5-0 lead in the second before rain forced them from the court again.

Halep, who recovered from 1-5 down in the second set in her quarter-final match against Wang Qiang, held serve upon the restart.

But in the very next game, Pliskova served out to ruin Halep's hope of reclaiming the number one ranking she lost when Japan's Osaka won the Australian Open earlier this year.

Roger Federer ready for John Isner shoot-out for Miami crown 

","
MIAMI: Roger Federer is gearing up for a Miami Open final shootout with John Isner on Sunday after blowing away young-gun Denis Shapovalov in straight sets.


Federer produced a 6-2, 6-4 masterclass at Hard Rock Stadium to leave up-and-coming star Shapovalov, who grew up idolizing the Swiss, chasing shadows during a difficult first set.

The Swiss was superb in dismantling the 19 year-old's game, but knows with huge serving Isner lying in wait in what will be the former world number one's 50th ATP Masters final, the key will be to defuse the reigning Miami Open champion's monster service game.

Isner used it to great effect in his 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/4) win over Shapovalov's friend and compatriot Felix Auger-Aliassime earlier in the day, smashing down 21 aces. He'll be looking for more of the same against 20 time Grand Slam champion Federer.

""Playing a big server like John is like being in a penalty shootout in soccer, but I enjoy it,"" said number four seed Federer who coped brilliantly with Kevin Anderson's dangerous serve in the quarter-finals, winning the first set to love.

""Sometimes you go with momentum. Sometimes you go with feel. Sometimes you guess maybe a little bit and sometimes you see it. It's a combination of all sort of things.

""You just hope that the stars align, that you pick the right side, that he picks the wrong side, that maybe he misses a serve, that you can put him in uncomfortable situations time and time again, and at the end somehow you find a way.""

Federer had no such challenge from Shapovalov, playing his fifth ATP Tour semi-final. Even though the Swiss was standing in his way of a first final, the 19 year-old stressed beforehand that it was a ""dream"" to take on Federer.

It quickly, however, turned into a nightmare.

The Canadian displayed understandable nerves early on, a struggle with his first serve proving as much in a 10 minute opening game which he eventually won.

Yet it didn't settle him down and when another horribly loose backhand flew long, Federer pocketed a vital early break and stayed in the driver's seat.

Shapovalov, who will jump to a career best 20th in the world thanks to this impressive run, enjoyed some much better moments in the second set and looked more relaxed, although the match was never in his hands.

He hit just eight winners in response to Federer's 30 but will learn from this.

""It's kind of surreal, being on the court against Roger,""admitted the Canadian who joked the only enjoyable moment for him was the warm up.

""Obviously I wasn't trying to focus on the fact that it's him on the other side.

""I was just trying to play as good as I can, but he played an excellent match. I wasn't able stay at his level. I'm just going to try to learn from this and move forward.""

Federer, assessing his own performance, said he played ""very well"".

""I had to because when you let Denis play, he's got some serious power and he gets rhythm going. He can really put you in uncomfortable situations.""

This was the first time since 2007 that two teenagers have reached an ATP Masters semi-finals and although both suffered disappointing defeats, they leave South Florida with their heads held high.

Auger-Aliassime's dream run finished with the youngster from Montreal competing confidently in the biggest match of his career even if he will rue the chances that escaped him after being broken while serving for the first and second set.

""Unusual,"" Isner called it. ""It could have been a little bit of inexperience and maybe a little bit of fatigue, also.""

Despite the disappointment etched all over Auger-Aliassime's face at the end, his run here will give him great confidence moving forward as he, and Shapovalov, aim to prove their Grand Slam credentials.

The 18-year-old is the youngest-ever male semi-finalist in Miami and only the second qualifier to reach the last four after Guillermo Canas reached the same stage in 2007 before losing to Novak Djokovic in the final.

Auger-Aliassime will also see his ranking jump from 55 to 33 in the world.

""I think I did the best that I could,"" he said. ""It's a chance you can't miss, serving two times for the set, and just -- I don't know. It's just terrible. The biggest lesson I learned was to stay in the present and believe in yourself.""

Injured Cristiano Ronaldo returns to Turin for tests 

","
MILAN: Cristiano Ronaldo will undergo further tests in Turin on Thursday as he battles to be fit for Juventus's Champions League double header against Ajax after picking up a thigh injury on international duty for Portugal.


The 34-year-old pulled up injured after half an hour into European champions Portugal's 1-1 Euro 2020 qualifier draw against Serbia.

Juventus said initial tests in Portugal had shown ""a minor injury"" to Ronaldo's right thigh, with their Champions League quarter-final first leg tie against Ajax on April 10.

Ronaldo flew to Barcelona for personal business on Wednesday, and not for a consultation, with the Portuguese star later posting a photo of himself on social media.

Italian media reported the five-time Ballon d'Or had returned by private jet to Turin late on Wednesday with tests scheduled with Juventus medical staff on Thursday morning.

But Ronaldo will likely miss the champions next three Serie A games, against Empoli on Saturday, Cagliari on April 2, and AC Milan four days later.

""I'm not worried. I know my body. I believe that in no more than two weeks I'll be fine,"" Ronaldo told reporters after the game against Serbia.

Juventus's contingent of international players return to training on Thursday as the champions push towards an eighth consecutive league title.

Juventus lead Napoli by 15 points despite losing their last game before the international break 2-0 to Genoa, with Ronaldo rested for the first time this season.

Sultan Azlan Shah Cup: India thrash Canada 7-3 to set up final with South Korea 

","
IPOH (Malaysia): Striker Mandeep Singh scored a hat-trick as India outplayed Canada 7-3 to enter the final of the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament on Wednesday. In the summit clash, they will face South Korea, who defeated Malaysia 2-1 in the last match of the day. 


A third win each for India and South Korea took their points tally to 10 apiece, with India ahead on goal difference. At six points from four matches, third-placed Malaysia now can't chase the top two teams on the leaderboard. 

After a rest day, the round-robin league will finish on Friday when all six teams will play their respective last match. 

In India's dominating show, the 24-year-old Mandeep fired in three quick goals (20th, 27th and 29th minutes), all of them coming in the second quarter, after Varun Kumar had given India the lead in the 12th minute of the high-scoring match.

At half time, India were 4-0 up in the match before Canada reduced the margin through a strike from Mark Pearson in the 35th minute.

Amit Rohidas (39th), Vivek Prasad (55th) and Nilakanta Sharma (58th) struck later to take the game beyond the reach of the Canadians who scored two late goals through Fin Boothroyd (50th) and James Wallace (57th).

With the victory, India continued their unbeaten show in the tournament with three wins and a draw. South Korea have had a similar run in their four matches. 

India play their final league match against Poland on Friday.

Sultan Azlan Shah Cup: Final berth assured, India look to test attacking prowess against lowly Poland 

","
IPOH (Malaysia): Their final berth already sealed, favourites India would look to test their attacking prowess and aim for a big win when they take on lower-ranked Poland in their final league match of the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament on Friday.


With three wins and a draw, India are currently leading the six-team league table with 10 points and a goal difference of eight.

Just like five-time champions India, Korea too have secured their place in Saturday's summit clash with 10 points but they have an inferior goal difference - five - than the Indians.

The last round league matches, thus, have become inconsequential for all the teams but both India and Korea would look to keep their winning momentum intact.

Against Poland, ranked 21st in the world, it should be an easy match for world number 5 India.

The Indians had a pretty good outing in the tournament so far, barring one match - against Saturday summit clash opponents Korea.

India defeated Asian Games gold medallist Japan 2-0 before getting the better of hosts Malaysia 4-2 and Canada 7-3. The only blip for the Manpreet Singh-led side was the 1-1 draw against Korea.

Come Friday, the Indians would be eyeing to test their attacking combinations ahead of the big final against Korea.

Mandeep Singh has been a live wire upfront, scoring a hat-trick against Canada but he needs more support from other strikers and that is precisely what the Indian think-tank would be hoping to achieve against Poland.

Besides Mandeep, Varun Kumar has been impressive with penalty corner conversions and he would like to continue in the same vein in the remainder of the matches.

After a slow start, the Indians showed progress in every match of the tournament with improved structure and discipline.

Poland, on the other hand, are still winless in the tournament and would at least look for a consolation point.

But it would be a herculean task to achieve that against a world-class side like India.

Poland were hammered 1-5 by Malaysia, 0-4 by Canada and 0-3 by Japan. Korea is the only team which had to fight tooth and nail to get the better of Poland 3-2.

With five titles under their belt, India are the second most successful team in the Azlan Shah Cup behind Australia (10 titles).

India's last triumph here came way back in 2010 when they shared the title with Korea after the match was abandoned due to rain.

Despite coming here with a mix of senior and junior players, India would be looking to end their eight-year title jinx.

In other inconsequential matches on Friday, Korea will take on Japan while Malaysia will finish off their campaign against Canada.

David Warner: Fans here inspire me, they are amazing 

","
HYDERABAD: Chasing 199 was never going to be easy for Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, but a brilliant display from David Warner and Jonny Bairstow at the top of the innings saw them cruise to a victory against Rajasthan Royals with an over to spare.


While it was key to not lose wickets, Warner also ensured that he kept the required run-rate under control. In fact, his 37-ball 69 was the reason why SRH could chase down the total without breaking a sweat.

SCHEDULE

Speaking after the game, Warner said that he loves how he always has the backing of the fans when he plays in Hyderabad. He also praised Sanju Samson for a brilliant hundred on a difficult wicket.

""One thing that inspires me is the local fans, they are amazing. We try and put on a good show. We didn't get off to a good start, a serious innings from Sanju and full credit to him. He came out and played really well. He allowed himself time and the wicket got better. Actually I didn't think it was a 200 wicket. We have played on similar wickets where if you bowl that hard length it is hard to bat,"" he said.

Along with Bairstow, he put on 110 in the first 10 overs before Ben Stokes dismissed him and the Australian said that the two are combining really well at the top of the innings.

""Me and Jonny have partnered really well since Kolkata. There have been a few hiccups with him trying to get off the mark, I have been hogging the strike a little bit, but over the years I have been held back a little bit.

""We know this ground pretty well. We know the dimensions well. There has been a breeze from one side for the last two days but tonight it wasn't there. You have to be calculative with your batting. I enjoy playing in front of this crowd. They are fantastic,"" he said.

Warner was pleased as a punch to get his hand on the Orange Cap for becoming the top run-scorer in the tournament so far. ""It is orange, Sunrisers, why not,"" he smiled.

Players should not be made sacrificial lambs in Super Cup row: Bhaskar Ganguly 

","
KOLKATA: Bhaskar Ganguly needs no introduction in Indian football. The former India goalkeeper, who led the country in the 1982 Asian Games, had spent the maximum period of his playing career in East Bengal after joining the side in 1976 following a season with Mohun Bagan.


Taking pain at the reign of confusion that now exists in Indian football, Ganguly supports the group of I-League clubs in making their voices of concerns heard but is against the idea of its call of boycotting the season-ending Super Cup from several I-League clubs, including East Bengal and Mohun Bagan. ""Players should not be made the sacrificial lambs in this fight,"" he said while speaking to TOI on Wednesday. Excerpts:


You are part of the Supreme Court-appointed two-man committee, along with S.Y. Qureshi, to oversee changes in the AIFF’s constitution. How would you like to see Indian football's roadmap?
Our job is not linked to formulating Indian football's roadmap, but broadly speaking, to see whether AIFF's constitution is adhered to the National Sports Code. I can't comment on this because we are still working on the issue.


But Indian football stands at a crossroads with the AIFF yet to come up with a blueprint for the future. Several I-League clubs have given a call to boycott this year's Super Cup. What do you make of the prevailing situation?
No doubt that there's a lot of confusion reigning in Indian football now. As the AIFF is silent on the roadmap issue, it leaves the stage to be filled with many speculations. The sooner we get a clarity in this the better for every stakeholder of Indian football. But I don't believe that you won't be able to achieve anything by boycotting a tournament.


So, don't you think that the I-League clubs' demands are justified?
I repeat that lack of clarity is certainly an issue which makes the situation more complicated. No doubt the revolting I-League clubs have grievances which require immediate attention from the federation. The federation can't ignore their contribution to Indian football and their voices must be heard. But all said and done, a tournament should not be sacrificed for this.


Can you elaborate?
Why do you form a team? To play, right? The players always want to play and this is the universal truth. I can tell you from a player's perspective that sitting out a tournament through injury is always painful. And here, you are training without knowing whether you will play or not. This is not only more painful but bizarre as well. One should not mix issues outside the field with ones inside it. If there is a battle to be fought with the powers-that-be to earn your dues, do it. But, at the same time, players should not be made the sacrificial lambs. During our time, we had a number of all-India tournaments, but now we are left with just I-League, ISL and Super Cup. That's why I want I-League clubs to play the Super Cup so that players can continue to do what they do best. You must not take football away from the feet of players.


There have been some reports of the club officials and new investor being at loggerheads with each other over a number of issues, including participation in Super Cup. Your views on this? 
Football has become a big business and you need financiers and investors to sustain it. Although I have played for all three big clubs of Kolkata, East Bengal have become my mother club. And as someone who has been associated with this club in various roles for long, it's good to see the club's tie-up with a new investor. However, if there are some issues, both parties should sit together and resolve them. You can't go on doing everything bypassing the club, because it's the club which is answerable to its supporters. This is why, I believe that you need an atmosphere where both parties can co-exist, peacefully and professionally.


There has been speculation that the I-League may lose its status of being the country's premier league to ISL next season. Your views?
Let there be on one league. If they (AIFF) want it to be ISL, let I-League clubs have a presence in it too. Running two leagues concurrently is a stop-gap arrangement but it can't and shouldn't be continued for long.

IPL 2019, DC vs KKR: More responsible and mature now, Andre Russell hogs spotlight at Kotla 

","
NEW DELHI: Andre Russell walked out to the Ferozeshah Kotla turf for practice with the entire Kolkata Knight Riders squad. Soon, he moved away from the bunch and went through his own drills. For the marauding form that he has shown in the first two games, one was expecting him to get into range-hitting immediately, as his Delhi Capitals counterparts were in the adjacent practice area.



POINTS TABLE I SCHEDULE

Russell instead got down to knocking back low, full balls to the throwdown specialist with an unusual narrow stance before heading to the nets to perfect his yorkers. He meant business. There were no chuckles or banters like his team-mates. The Capitals’ formidable pace attack of Kagiso Rabada, Trent Boult and Chris Morris would have been watching from the adjacent nets, trying to get a sense of what’s in store for them when they take the field here on Saturday evening.



The hosts may boast of exciting power-hitters like Rishabh Pant and Chris Morris but the crowd will be on the edge of their seats when the big Jamaican occupies the crease. “The fact that Russ led Jamaica Tallawahs in the Caribbean Premier League has given him the sense of responsibility towards the team. He looks at himself as a senior statesman in the group and wants to make every outing of his count,” Russell’s KKR teammate Robin Uthappa reckoned on the eve of the match.

Russell’s two match-defining knocks so far must have sent the rival thinktank into overdrive even as Capitals advisor Sourav Ganguly chose to dismiss the ‘Russell factor’ by saying: “Anybody could have one good day.”



“Russ is an absolute genius at hitting the cricket ball, it’s pretty simple as that. At the end of the day, I think it’s going to be a case of he misses and I hit. I don’t want to give away too many tactics or anything,” was Morris’ retort. Then the confession followed: “I’ve always said to people I look like a duck while swimming in water that is nice and calm, but underneath (the water) their feet are kicking like this. I might look calm and collected, but inside my brain’s working overtime.”

That’s what he has managed to do — getting into head to inject a sense of fear. At the same, his team needs to ensure that it doesn’t get into a comfort zone. “It’s sometimes a double-edged sword,” Uthappa said. “The strike rate of 130-135 is the average you want to maintain. Russ is going to have a few bad days. It’s bound to happen the way he plays. Hopefully there are not as many bad days as good days.”

Barring Kuldeep Yadav, KKR don’t have the big stars of Indian cricket in their ranks. But it’s their own Russ who is currently making things easier for skipper Dinesh Karthik. He’s become more game aware. “He understands the impact he can have in the last four overs. It’s important for him to have the freedom. It would be great for him to have batsman batting with him,” Uthappa summed up the scenario.

If anything, inconsistency has been Russell’s problem over the years. But going by Uthappa’s claims, Russell is out to change that notion. Kotla could be in for some serious fireworks!
